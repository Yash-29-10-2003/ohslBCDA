0,Methods for Assessing Corneal Opacity,"Purpose: Corneal opacity is a common clinical problem that directly impedes the cornea's function of light transmission. Despite this, there are no standard means of quantifying opacity. The purpose of this review is to summarize the reported options both clinicians and researchers have for objectively assessing corneal opacity. Methods: Review of the peer-reviewed literature reporting methods for assessing clinical opacity and transparency in both the research and clinic setting. Conclusion: Although a number of techniques for assessing corneal opacity have been reported in the literature, none have been widely adopted, highlighting the fact that there is still a need for an accessible, objective and easy to use method for quantifying corneal opacity.","['1 a Schepens Eye Research Institute/Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary , Harvard Medical School , Boston , MA , USA.']","Thomas H Dohlman, Jia Yin, Reza Dana, ",Seminars in ophthalmology,2019,Cornea; OCT; fibrosis; imaging; opacity.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31188043
1,FLASH radiotherapy: ultra-high dose rates to spare healthy tissue,"A recent addition to the treatment options in external beam therapy, so-called FLASH radiotherapy, shows remarkable healthy-tissue-sparing properties in a number of pre-clinical studies without impacting the overall treatment efficacy. Its potential in clinical applications is attracting a great deal of interest in the medical community. The use of ultra-high dose rates at extremely short irradiation times has been shown to significantly enhance the differential effects between normal and tumor tissue. This makes it possible to increase treatment doses without further harming the surrounding healthy tissue. While most studies to date have focused on the use of electron beams, X-ray and proton FLASH radiotherapy have also shown beneficial effects, although for these latter two the results still need to be independently confirmed. Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying the biological effects remain to be elucidated. Very recently, the FLASH effect has been demonstrated in the first human patient, with promising results, supporting further clinical studies. This review will present an overview of the investigations into FLASH radiotherapy to date.","['1 Radiation Science and Technology, Delft University of Technology, Delft, the Netherlands.', '2 Physics Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL, USA.']","R M de Kruijff, ",International journal of radiation biology,2020 Apr,FLASH-RT; differential effect; normal tissue protection; ultra-high dose-rate irradiation.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31829765
2,Disk-based one-dimensional photonic crystal slabs for label-free immunosensing,"One-dimensional photonic crystal slabs are periodic optical nanostructures that produce guided-mode resonance. They couple part of the incident light into the waveguide generating bandgaps in the transmittance spectrum, whose position is sensitive to refractive index variations on their surface. In this study, we present one-dimensional photonic crystal slab biosensors based on the internal nanogrooved structure of Blu-ray disks for label-free immunosensing. We demonstrated that this polycarbonate structure coated with a critical thickness of TiO2 generates guided-mode resonance. Its optical behavior was established comparing it with other compact disk structures. The results were theoretically calculated and experimentally demonstrated, all them being in agreement. The bioanalytical performance of these photonic crystals was experimentally demonstrated in a model assay to quantify IgGs as well as in two immunoassays to determine the biomarkers C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase (detection limits of 0.1, 87, and 13 nM, respectively). The results are promising towards the development of new low-cost, portable, and label-free optical biosensors that join these photonic crystals with dedicated bioanalytical scanners based on compact disk drives.","['1 Instituto Interuniversitario de Investigación de Reconocimiento Molecular y Desarrollo Tecnológico (IDM), Universitat Politècnica de València, Universitat de València, Camino de Vera s/n, 46022 Valencia, Spain.', '2 Instituto Interuniversitario de Investigación de Reconocimiento Molecular y Desarrollo Tecnológico (IDM), Universitat Politècnica de València, Universitat de València, Camino de Vera s/n, 46022 Valencia, Spain; Departamento de Química, Universitat Politècnica de València, Camino de Vera s/n, 46022 Valencia, Spain.

3,Accuracy of Intraocular Lens Calculation Formulas,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      To compare the accuracy of intraocular lens (IOL) calculation formulas (Barrett Universal II, Haigis, Hoffer Q, Holladay 1, Holladay 2, Olsen, and SRK/T) in the prediction of postoperative refraction using a single optical biometry device. Design:
      
    

    
      Retrospective consecutive case series. Participants:
      
    

    
      A total of 13 301 cataract operations with an AcrySof SN60WF implant and 5200 operations with a SA60AT implant (Alcon Laboratories, Inc., Fort Worth, TX). Methods:
      
    

    
      All patients undergoing cataract surgery between July 1, 2014, and December 31, 2015, with Lenstar 900 optical biometry were eligible. A single eye per patient was included in the final analysis, resulting in a total of 18 501 cases. We compared the performance of each formula with respect to the error in predicted spherical equivalent and evaluated the effect of applying the Wang-Koch (WK) adjustment for eyes with axial length >25.0 mm on 4 of the formulas. Results:
      
    

    
      For the SN60WF, the standard deviation of the prediction error, in order of lowest to highest, was the Barrett Universal II (0.404), Olsen (0.424), Haigis (0.437), Holladay 2 (0.450), Holladay 1 (0.453), SRK/T (0.463), and Hoffer Q (0.473), and the results for the SA60AT were similar. The Barrett formula was significantly better than the other formulas in postoperative refraction prediction (P < 0.01) for both IOL types. Application of the WK axial length modification generally resulted in a shift from hyperopic to myopic outcomes in long eyes. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Overall, the Barrett Universal II formula had the lowest prediction error for the 2 IOL models studied.","['1 The Permanent Medical Group, Redwood City Medical Center, Redwood City, California.

7,Risk of developing radiogenic cancer following photon-beam radiotherapy for Graves' orbitopathy,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      The objective of this study was to estimate the probability for cancer development due to radiotherapy for Graves' orbitopathy with 6 MV x rays. Methods:
      
    

    
      Orbital irradiation was simulated with the MCNP code. The radiation dose received by 10 out-of-field organs having a strong disposition for carcinogenesis was calculated with Monte Carlo methods. These dose calculations were used to estimate the organ-dependent lifetime attributable risk (LAR) for cancer induction in 30- and 50-yr-old males and females on the basis of the linear model suggested by the BEIR-VII report. Differential dose-volume histograms derived from patients' three-dimensional (3D) radiotherapy plans were employed to determine the organ equivalent dose (OED) of the brain which was partly exposed to primary radiation. The OED and the relevant LAR for brain cancer development were assessed with the plateau, bell-shaped and mechanistic models. The radiotherapy-induced cancer risks were compared with the lifetime intrinsic risk (LIR) values for unexposed population. Results:
      
    

    
      The radiation dose range to organs excluded from the treatment volume was 0.1-91.0 mGy for a target dose of 20 Gy. These peripheral organ doses increased the LIRs for cancer development of unexposed 30- and 50-yr-old males up to 1.0% and 0.2%, respectively. The corresponding elevations after radiotherapy of females were 2.0% and 0.4%. The use of nonlinear models gave an OED range of the brain of 482.0-562.5 mGy depending upon the model used for analysis and the patient's gender. The elevation of the LIR for developing brain malignancies after radiotherapy of 30-yr-old males and females reached to 13.3% and 16.6%, respectively. The corresponding increases after orbital irradiation at the age of 50 yr were 6.7% and 8.3%. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The level of the LIR increase attributable to radiation therapy for GO varied widely by the organ under examination and the age and gender of the exposed subject. This study provides the required data to quantify the elevation of these baseline cancer risks following orbital irradiation.","['1 Department of Medical Physics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Crete, P.O.

9,Imaging Cell Interaction in Tracheal Mucosa During Influenza Virus Infection Using Two-photon Intravital Microscopy,"The analysis of cell-cell or cell-pathogen interaction in vivo is an important tool to understand the dynamics of the immune response to infection. Two-photon intravital microscopy (2P-IVM) allows the observation of cell interactions in deep tissue in living animals, while minimizing the photobleaching generated during image acquisition. To date, different models for 2P-IVM of lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs have been described. However, imaging of respiratory organs remains a challenge due to the movement associated with the breathing cycle of the animal. Here, we describe a protocol to visualize in vivo immune cell interactions in the trachea of mice infected with influenza virus using 2P-IVM. To this purpose, we developed a custom imaging platform, which included the surgical exposure and intubation of the trachea, followed by the acquisition of dynamic images of neutrophils and dendritic cells (DC) in the mucosal epithelium. Additionally, we detailed the steps needed to perform influenza intranasal infection and flow cytometric analysis of immune cells in the trachea. Finally, we analyzed neutrophil and DC motility as well as their interactions during the course of a movie. This protocol allows for the generation of stable and bright 4D images necessary for the assessment of cell-cell interactions in the trachea.","['1 Faculty of Biomedical Sciences, Institute for Research in Biomedicine, Università della Svizzera italiana (USI); Graduate School of Cellular and Molecular Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Bern.', '2 Faculty of Biomedical Sciences, Institute for Research in Biomedicine, Università della Svizzera italiana (USI).', '3 Faculty of Biomedical Sciences, Institute for Research in Biomedicine, Università della Svizzera italiana (USI); Institute of Computational Science, Università della Svizzera italiana (USI).', '4 Faculty of Biomedical Sciences, Institute for Research in Biomedicine, Università della Svizzera italiana (USI); santiago.gonzalez@irb.usi.ch.']","Miguel Palomino-Segura, Tommaso Virgilio, Diego Morone, Diego U Pizzagalli, Santiago F Gonzalez, ",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30176018
10,Intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) - The future of IMRT for head and neck cancer,"Radiation therapy plays an integral role in the management of head and neck cancers (HNCs). While most HNC patients have historically been treated with photon-based radiation techniques such as intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), there is a growing awareness of the potential clinical benefits of proton therapy over IMRT in the definitive, postoperative and reirradiation settings given the unique physical properties of protons. Intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT), also known as ""pencil beam proton therapy,"" is a sophisticated mode of proton therapy that is analogous to IMRT and an active area of investigation in cancer care. Multifield optimization IMPT allows for high quality plans that can target superficially located HNCs as well as large neck volumes while significantly reducing integral doses. Several dosimetric studies have demonstrated the superiority of IMPT over IMRT to improve dose sparing of nearby organs such as the larynx, salivary glands, and esophagus. Evidence of the clinical translation of these dosimetric advantages has been demonstrated with documented toxicity reductions (such as decreased feeding tube dependency) after IMPT for patients with HNCs. While there are relative challenges to IMPT planning that exist today such as particle range uncertainties and high sensitivity to anatomical changes, ongoing investigations in image-guidance techniques and robust optimization methods are promising. A systematic approach towards utilizing IMPT and additional prospective studies are necessary in order to more accurately estimate the clinical benefit of IMPT over IMRT and passive proton therapy on a case-by-case basis for patients with sub-site specific HNCs.","['1 Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', '2 Department of Radiation Oncology, Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.

11,Emergence of quantum correlations from interacting fibre-cavity polaritons,"Over the past decade, exciton-polaritons in semiconductor microcavities have revealed themselves as one of the richest realizations of a light-based quantum fluid1, subject to fascinating new physics and potential applications2-6. For instance, in the regime of large two-body interactions, polaritons can be used to manipulate the quantum properties of a light field7-9. In this work, we report on the emergence of quantum correlations in laser light transmitted through a fibre-cavity polariton system. We observe a dispersive shape of the autocorrelation function around the polariton resonance that indicates the onset of this regime. The weak amplitude of these correlations indicates a state that still remains far from a low-photon-number state. Nonetheless, given the underlying physical mechanism7, our work opens up the prospect of eventually using polaritons to turn laser light into single photons.","['1 Department of Physics and Astronomy, Macquarie University, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. guillermo.munozmatutano@mq.edu.au.', '2 ARC Centre of Excellence for Engineered Quantum Systems, Macquarie University, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. guillermo.munozmatutano@mq.edu.au.', '3 Department of Physics and Astronomy, Macquarie University, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', '4 ARC Centre of Excellence for Engineered Quantum Systems, Macquarie University, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', '5 ARC Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology, School of Science, RMIT University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', '6 Centre de Nanosciences et de Nanotechnologies, CNRS (C2N), Universities Paris-Sud and Paris-Saclay, Palaiseau, France.', '7 Univ.

To this end, high sensitivity photonic sensors based on silicon photonic bandgap (PBG) structures were used, where the MB probes were immobilized via their 5' termination. Those MBs incorporate a biotin moiety close to their 3' termination in order to selectively bind a streptavidin molecule to them. The different photonic sensing responses obtained toward the target oligonucleotide detection, when the streptavidin molecule was bound to the MB probes or not, demonstrate the conformational change suffered by the MB upon hybridization, which promotes the displacement of the streptavidin molecule away from the surface of the photonic sensing structure.","['1 Nanophotonics Technology Center, Universitat Politècnica de València, Valencia, Spain.', '2 Departamento de Química, IDM, Instituto Interuniversitario de Investigación de Reconocimiento Molecular y Desarrollo Tecnológico, Universitat Politècnica de València, Valencia, Spain.', '3 School of Biological Sciences, University of East Anglia, Norwich, UK.', '4 microTEC Gesellschaft für Mikrotechnologie mbH, Duisburg, Germany.']","Ángela Ruiz-Tórtola, Francisco Prats-Quílez, Daniel González-Lucas, María-José Bañuls, Ángel Maquieira, Guy Wheeler, Tamas Dalmay, Amadeu Griol, Juan Hurtado, Helge Bohlmann, Reiner Götzen, Jaime García-Rupérez, ",Journal of biophotonics,2018 Oct,conformational change; molecular beacon; photonic bandgap; photonic biosensor; silicon photonics.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29664230
14,Which photon energy for intensity-modulated radiotherapy and volumetric-modulated arctherapy in 2019?,"For more than a decade, the majority of radiation oncology centres have been delivering intensity-modulated radiotherapy (then volumetric-modulated arctherapy) with 6 MV photons as their standard of care. This « dogma » had been supported by the usual absence of dosimetric advantages with high-energy photons (15 to 18 MV or more), at least for the planning target volume and the dose received by the adjacent organs at risk, and by the neutron component as soon as the photon energy exceeds 10 MV. Recent data could question such a dogma. First, in 2019, one cannot avoid taking into account the integral dose, delivered outside the treated volume. Actually, most available data show that integral dose is higher with low energy photons (as 6 MV) than with higher energies. Moreover, recent studies have shown that the neutron component at high energies may have been overestimated in the past; in fact, the neutron dose appears to be lower, and sometimes much lower, than the dose we accept for imaging. Finally, a few cohort studies did not show any increase in second cancers incidence after high-energy photon radiotherapy. In such a context, the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) TG 158 document, released a few months ago, clearly states that there is a trade-off between high- and low-energy treatments. High-energy therapy is associated with neutron production, while low-energy therapy results in higher stray photon dose. According to the AAPM, « the optimal energy is likely an intermediate such as 10 MV ».","['1 GIE Charlebourg, Amethyst group, 65, avenue Foch, 92250 La Garenne-Colombes, France.

Adaptive optics (AO) imaging is a promising high-resolution investigation technique in ophthalmology that can bring new information about the pathophysiology of diabetic retinopathy. Material and methods. Seven patients previously diagnosed with diabetic retinopathy were investigated with optical coherence tomography (OCT) scanning, OCT angiography, fundus photo, and AO retinal camera (rtx1TM, Imagine Eyes, Orsay, France). Results. The red lesions on fundus photos appeared on AO imaging as hyporeflective lesions. OCT angiography helped us to differentiate between microaneurysms and hemorrhages. Hard exudates had a heterogeneous granular appearance. Retinal oedema was proved to have a blurring effect on the AO images. In addition to this, cystic spaces were identified to have a hyporeflective demarcation line. Conclusions. AO imaging is offering a fine documentation of retinal lesions and might become an important instrument for early diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy and for explaining its pathophysiological mechanisms.

16,"PARbars: Cheap, Easy to Build Ceptometers for Continuous Measurement of Light Interception in Plant Canopies","Ceptometry is a technique used to measure the transmittance of photosynthetically active radiation through a plant canopy using multiple light sensors connected in parallel on a long bar. Ceptometry is often used to infer properties of canopy structure and light interception, notably leaf area index (LAI) and effective plant area index (PAIeff). Due to the high cost of commercially available ceptometers, the number of measurements that can be taken is often limited in space and time. This limits the usefulness of ceptometry for studying genetic variability in light interception, and precludes thorough analysis of, and correction for, biases that can skew measurements depending on the time of day. We developed continuously logging ceptometers (called PARbars) that can be produced for USD $75 each and yield high quality data comparable to commercially available alternatives. Here we provide detailed instruction on how to build and calibrate PARbars, how to deploy them in the field and how to estimate PAI from collected transmittance data. We provide representative results from wheat canopies and discuss further considerations that should be made when using PARbars.","['1 School of Life and Environmental Sciences, Sydney Institute of Agriculture, University of Sydney; william.salter@sydney.edu.au.', '2 School of Life and Environmental Sciences, Sydney Institute of Agriculture, University of Sydney.', '3 Department of Plant Sciences, University of California, Davis.']","William T Salter, Andrew M Merchant, Matthew E Gilbert, Thomas N Buckley, ",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31132041

19,Widefield High Frame Rate Single-Photon SPAD Imagers for SPIM-FCS,"Photon-counting sensors based on standard complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) represent an emerging class of imagers that enable the counting and/or timing of single photons at zero readout noise (better than high-speed electron-multiplying charge-coupling devices) and over large arrays. They have seen substantial progress over the last 15 years, increasing their spatial resolution, timing accuracy, and sensitivity while reducing spurious signals such as afterpulsing and dark counts. They are increasingly being applied for time-resolved applications with the added advantage of enabling real-time options such as autocorrelation. We report in this study on the use of such a state-of-the-art 512 × 128 SPAD array, capable of a time resolution of 10-5-10-6 s for full frames while retaining acceptable photosensitivity thanks to the use of dedicated microlenses, in a selective plane illumination-fluorescence correlation spectroscopy setup. The latter allows us to perform thousands of fluorescence-correlation spectroscopy measurements simultaneously in a two-dimensional slice of the sample. This high-speed SPAD imager enables the measurement of molecular motion of small fluorescent particles such as single chemical dye molecules. Inhomogeneities in the molecular detection efficiency were compensated for by means of a global fit of the auto- and cross-correlation curves, which also made a calibration-free measurement of various samples possible. The afterpulsing effect could also be mitigated, making the measurement of the diffusion of Alexa-488 possible, and the overall result quality was further improved by spatial binning. The particle concentrations in the focus tend to be overestimated by a factor of 1.7 compared to a confocal setup; a calibration is thus required if absolute concentrations need to be measured.

20,Quantities for assessing high photon doses to the body: a calculational approach,"Tissue reactions are the most clinically significant consequences of high-dose exposures to ionising radiation. However, currently there is no universally recognized dose quantity that can be used to assess and report generalised risks to individuals following whole body exposures in the high-dose range. In this work, a number of potential dose quantities are presented and discussed, with mathematical modelling techniques employed to compare them and explore when their differences are most or least manifest. The results are interpreted to propose the average (D GRB) of the absorbed doses to the stomach, small intestine, red bone marrow, and brain as the optimum quantity for informing assessments of risk. A second, maximally conservative dose quantity (D Max) is also suggested, which places limits on any under-estimates resulting from the adoption of D GRB. The primary aim of this work is to spark debate, with further work required to refine the final choice of quantity or quantities most appropriate for the full range of different potential exposure scenarios.","['1 Public Health England CRCE, Chilton, Didcot, OXON, United Kingdom.']","Jonathan S Eakins, Elizabeth A Ainsbury, ",Journal of radiological protection : official journal of the Society for Radiological Protection,2018 Jun,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29692366
21,A bio-inspired photonic nitrocellulose array for ultrasensitive assays of single nucleic acids,"Here we report a bio-inspired photonic nitrocellulose array for ultrasensitive nucleic-acid detection. The patterned photonic nitrocellulose array is inspired by the Stenocara beetle living in the desert, which can collect water on its bumpy back surface from early morning fogs so that spontaneous generation of separated reaction droplets for loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)-based detection is enabled. Owing to the slow-photon effect of the photonic nitrocellulose, the fluorescence signal of calcein produced during the LAMP reaction can be effectively enhanced (up to 32 fold), which results in dramatically improved sensitivity for the detection of single nucleic acids in 40 min. We demonstrate that Staphylococcus aureus (SA) DNA can be quantitatively detected with a limit-of-detection of 0.60 copy per μL. The consumption of reagents and sample is also remarkably reduced owing to the highly decreased dead volume of the nitrocellulose substrate. Therefore, this bio-inspired photonic nitrocellulose array is promising for carrying out inexpensive, ultrasensitive, and high-throughput nucleic-acid detection under resource-limited settings.","['1 State Key Laboratory of Bioelectronics, School of Biological Science and Medical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing 210096, China. liuh@seu.edu.cn gu@seu.edu.cn.']","Junjie Chi, Biao Ma, Xing Dong, Bingbing Gao, Abdelrahman Elbaz, Hong Liu, Zhongze Gu, ",The Analyst,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30090914
22,K-edge spectral computed tomography with a photon counting detector and discrete reconstruction,"X-ray K-Edge Subtraction Computed Tomography (KES-CT) is based on the acquisition of two images at different energies, one below and one above the Kedge of a contrast agent. KES-CT is mainly performed at synchrotron facilities where a tunable monochromatic X-ray beam is available. Thanks to innovative Photon Counting Xray Detectors (PCXDs), it would be desirable to collect the two images in a single shot with a conventional polychromatic Xray spectrum. This approach, sometimes called spectral-CT or color-CT eliminates the risk of misregistration due to motion between consecutive acquisitions and it should allow for scans with much lower doses of contrast medium. Spectral CT is considered very promising but its practical application is being hampered by several practical issues, one of these being the charge sharing affecting the energy resolution of PCXDs. However, latest generations of PCXDs implement hardware solutions to cope with the charge sharing effects, thus allowing sharper color sensitivity. This work presents a K-edge spectral CT imaging preliminary protocol based on the Pixirad-I/PixieIII detector where discrete tomography is used to present the reconstructed slices as color images. Results show that when a solution for the charge sharing issue is considered and refined reconstruction methods are applied, accurate K-edge subtraction imaging with conventional sources can be performed.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Francesco Brun, Vittorio Di Trapani, Diego Dreossi, Renata Longo, Pasquale Delogu, Luigi Rigon, ",Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

To this end, dense cultures of Micractinium sp. were grown at 37 °C under nitrogen (N) starvation and exposed to a light intensity of 1000 µmol photons m-2 s-1 of different light regimes. The highest per-biomass TAG-content and maximal volumetric productivities of TAG were displayed by the cultures grown under flashing light of 5 Hz with 50% duty cycle. Based on the results, a sufficiently high-starting culture density should be combined with a high irradiance delivered by an appropriate light regime to enhance the production of biomass enriched TAGs.","['1 The Mina and Everard Goodman Faculty of Life Sciences, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan 5290002, Israel; Bar Ilan Institute of Nanotechnology and Advanced Materials (BINA), Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan 5290002, Israel.

24,Derivation of mean dose tolerances for new fractionation schemes and treatment modalities,"Avoiding toxicities in radiotherapy requires the knowledge of tolerable organ doses. For new, experimental fractionation schemes (e.g. hypofractionation) these are typically derived from traditional schedules using the biologically effective dose (BED) model. In this report we investigate the difficulties of establishing mean dose tolerances that arise since the mean BED depends on the entire spatial dose distribution, rather than on the dose level alone. A formula has been derived to establish mean physical dose constraints such that they are mean BED equivalent to a reference treatment scheme. This formula constitutes a modified BED equation where the influence of the spatial dose distribution is summarized in a single parameter, the dose shape factor. To quantify effects we analyzed 24 liver cancer patients for whom both proton and photon IMRT treatment plans were available. The results show that the standard BED equation-neglecting the spatial dose distribution-can overestimate mean dose tolerances for hypofractionated treatments by up to 20%. The shape difference between photon and proton dose distributions can cause 30-40% differences in mean physical dose for plans having identical mean BEDs. Converting hypofractionated, 5/15-fraction proton doses to mean BED equivalent photon doses in traditional 35-fraction regimens resulted in up to 10 Gy higher doses than applying the standard BED formula. The dose shape effect should be accounted for to avoid overestimation of mean dose tolerances, particularly when estimating constraints for hypofractionated regimens. Additionally, tolerances established for one treatment modality cannot necessarily be applied to other modalities with drastically different dose distributions, such as proton therapy. Last, protons may only allow marginal (5-10%) dose escalation if a fraction-size adjusted organ mean dose is constraining instead of a physical dose.","['1 Department of Radiation Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, United States of America.

However, imaging this weak emission with the necessary single-photon sensitivity in the clinical room is challenging because of milliwatt-level ambient room lighting and the presence of stray high-energy radiation. In this Letter, we demonstrate, to the best of our knowledge, the first Cherenkov imaging with a time-gated quanta image sensor employing a large single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array. Detecting single Cherenkov photons was possible with high photon avalanche gain, fast temporal gating, and moderately high ∼7% photon detection probability. Single-bit digitization and active SPAD quenching enabled stray x-ray noise suppression and photon-noise-limited imaging in a clinical environment.

26,Humerus photon starvation streak artefact,"Introduction:
      
    

    
      The reduced (attenuated) number of photons passing through the arm can result in a combination of fine and thick streak artefacts, particularly with the use of thin CT slices and lower radiation dose parameters. This phenomenon is known as photon starvation. We noted an abnormal appearance of the humerus when imaged with certain arm position. This appearance was thought to be artefact due to photon starvation. Methods:
      
    

    
      A human radius bone was imaged in different positions and the kV and mA were varied in an attempt to reproduce the artefact, which would support the hypothesis that the artefact may be caused by bone attenuation. Results:
      
    

    
      Scanning the bone in a different angle and radiation dose parameters reproduced the artefactual appearance of the bone. Conclusion:

Familiarity with this artefact is essential to avoid misinterpretation.","['1 Fiona Stanley Hospital, Murdoch, Western Australia, Australia.']","Zeyad Al-Ogaili, Anita J Reed, John Burrage, ",Journal of medical imaging and radiation oncology,2018 Oct,CT artefact; Humerus; artefact; photon starvation.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29655295

28,Characteristics of Monitor Chamber for Photon Energy Mounted on Linear Accelerators,"Radiotherapy linear accelerators are calibrated to deliver a specific dose under standard conditions following accepted protocols (for example, JSMP12 protocol). The linear accelerator output is calibrated to deliver 1.0 cGy per 1.0 monitor unit (MU) at the depth of maximum in tissue maximum ratio. Beams of photons or electrons pass through a monitor chamber located in the linear accelerators head, which turns off the beam once the prescribed MU is delivered. The clinical outcome of radiotherapy demands that the linear accelerators output do not deviate from the calibrated level by more than a few percent. The purpose of this study is to characterize and understand the long term behavior of the output, change of flatness and symmetry from megavoltage radiotherapy linear accelerators (TrueBeam, Varian Medical Systems). Output trends of beams from three linear accelerators in two institutions over a period of more than 3 years are reported and analyzed. Output taken once per month the basis of this study. The output is measured using ionization chamber with water phantom. These are calibrated by accredited dosimetry laboratory with Japanese traceability system. When the output variation was bounded ±1%, monitor chamber was re-calibrated. The results show that the output from Linac was constantly upward trend. The output of Linac increased up to 8.0% in 1st year. However, upward trend became plateau slowly after years. Beams of same energies from another Linac are correlated with a correlation coefficient. Symmetry and flatness from one Truebeam stabled within 1%. If these adjustments are artificially removed then there is an increase in output, it is important to check the output of linear accelerator periodically.","['1 Department of Central Radiology, Kindai University Hospital.', '2 Department of Central Radiology, Kansai Rousai Hospital.']","Kenji Matsumoto, Kazuo Tarutani, ",Nihon Hoshasen Gijutsu Gakkai zasshi,2019,linear accelerator; monitor chamber; output trend.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31631106
29,Incident Photon Number and Reconstructed Linear Attenuation Coefficients in Iterative CT Image Reconstruction,"[Purpose] The iterative CT image reconstruction (IR) method has been successfully incorporated into commercial CT scanners as a means to promote low-dose CT with high image quality. However, the algorithm of the IR method has not been made publicly available by scanner manufacturers. Kudo reviewed the fundamentals of IR methods on the basis of the articles published by the joint research group of each manufacture that were released before and during product development (Med Imag Tech 32: 239-248, 2014). According to this review, the object function of the IR method consists of the data fidelity term (likelihood) and the regularization term. The regularization term plays a significant role in the IR method; however, it has not been clarified whether or not the variance of projection data should be included into the likelihood to act the regularization term effectively. Our purpose in this study was to investigate the relationship of the incident photon number and the reconstructed linear attenuation coefficients of the IR method by numerical experiments.[Methods] We assumed the X-ray beam was a pencil beam, and the system matrix was given by the line integral of linear attenuation coefficients because we focused on the accuracy of the reconstructed linear attenuation coefficients in the ideal photon detection system equations given by Kudo. Total variation (TV) and the relative difference function were used for regularization of the IR method. Three kinds of numerical phantoms with 256×256 pixels were used as test images. Poisson noise was added to the projection data with 256 linear sampling and 256 views over 180°. The accuracy of reconstructed linear attenuation coefficients was evaluated by the mean reconstructed value within a region of interest (ROI) and the relative root mean square errors (%RMSEs) to the object image.[Results] The linear attenuation coefficients were reconstructed accurately by the IR method including the variance of projection data into the likelihood in comparison with the IR method without including the variance. When the incident photon number ranged from 100 to 2000 for the object having a mean linear attenuation coefficient of 0.067 to 0.087 cm-1, the reconstructed linear attenuation coefficients in ROI were close to the true values. However, when the incident photon number was 50, both the accuracy and the uniformity of reconstructed images decreased.[Discussion] From the viewpoint of the visual observation, the image quality of the IR method was superior to that of the filtered back-projection (FBP) image processed with the Gaussian filter of FWHM equal to 3 pixels. For the object with a high absorber, the FBP gives linear attenuation coefficients that were lower than the true values. This phenomenon was also observed in the IR method. The projection data of CT were given by the logarithm operation of the ratio between the incident photon and the transmitted photon numbers. If the transmitted photon number happened to be equal to 0 owing to the influence of noise, it was held to a value of 1 to avoid the logarithm of zero. This process caused an error of the linear attenuation coefficients.[Conclusion] The variance of projection data should be included into the likelihood to act the regularization term effectively in the IR method.","['1 Tokyo Metropolitan University.', '2 Department of Radiology, Showa University Fujigaoka Hospital.', '3 Faculty of Health Sciences, Department of Medical Radiological Technology, Kyorin University.']","Hiroyuki Shinohara, Takeyuki Hashimoto, ",Igaku butsuri : Nihon Igaku Butsuri Gakkai kikanshi = Japanese journal of medical physics : an official journal of Japan Society of Medical Physics,2019,Poisson noise; computer simulation; iterative image reconstruction; low-dose CT; regularization; total variation.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30828046
30,Average stopping powers for electron and photon sources for radiobiological modeling and microdosimetric applications,"This study concerns calculation of the average electronic stopping power for photon and electron sources. It addresses two problems that have not yet been fully resolved. The first is defining the electron spectrum used for averaging in a way that is most suitable for radiobiological modeling. We define it as the spectrum of electrons entering the sensitive to radiation volume (SV) within the cell nucleus, at the moment they enter the SV. For this spectrum we derive a formula that combines linearly the fluence spectrum and the source spectrum. The latter is the distribution of initial energies of electrons produced by a source. Previous studies used either the fluence or source spectra, but not both, thereby neglecting a part of the complete spectrum. Our derived formula reduces to these two prior methods in the case of high and low energy sources, respectively. The second problem is extending electron spectra to low energies. Previous studies used an energy cut-off on the order of 1 keV. However, as we show, even for high energy sources, such as 60Co, electrons with energies below 1 keV contribute about 30% to the dose. In this study all the spectra were calculated with Geant4-DNA code and a cut-off energy of only 11 eV. We present formulas for calculating frequency- and dose-average stopping powers, numerical results for several important electron and photon sources, and tables with all the data needed to use our formulas for arbitrary electron and photon sources producing electrons with initial energies up to ∼1 MeV.","['1 Department of Radiation Physics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, United States of America.']","Oleg N Vassiliev, Stephen F Kry, David R Grosshans, Radhe Mohan, ",Physics in medicine and biology,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29411712
31,Assessment of Functionals for TDDFT Calculations of One- and Two-Photon Absorption Properties of Neutral and Anionic Fluorescent Proteins Chromophores,"Performance of DFT functionals with different percentages of exact Hartree-Fock exchange energy (EX) is assessed for recovery of the CC2 reference one- (OPA) and two-photon absorption (TPA) spectra of fluorescent proteins chromophores in vacuo. The investigated DFT functionals, together with their EX contributions are BLYP (0%), B3LYP (20%), B1LYP (25%), BHandHLYP (50%), and CAM-B3LYP (19% at short range and 65% at long range). Our test set consists of anionic and neutral chromophores as naturally occurring in the fluorescent proteins. For the first time, we compare TDDFT and CC2 methods for higher excited states than the S1 state, exhibiting relatively large TPA intensity. Our TDDFT results for neutral chromophores reveal an increase in excitation energies as well as TPA and OPA intensities errors, compared to CC2-derived results, as the DFT functional contains less exact exchange. The long-range-corrected CAM-B3LYP functional performs the best, closely followed by BHandHLYP, while BLYP usually significantly underestimates all investigated spectral properties, hence being the worst in reproducing the reference CC2 results. The hybrid B3LYP and B1LYP functionals can be roughly placed in between. We propose that TDDFT may underestimate the TPA intensities for neutral chromophores of fluorescent proteins due to underestimated oscillator strengths between some excited states. In the case of anionic chromophores, we find that B3LYP and B1LYP functionals overcome others in terms of reproducing CC2 excitation energies. On the other hand, however, TPA intensity is usually significantly underestimated, and in this respect, CAM-B3LYP functional seems to be again superior. In contrast to the case of neutral chromophores, it seems that a large magnitude of excited-state dipole moments or changes in dipole moments upon excitation may be the driving force behind high TPA transition moments.","['1 Advanced Materials Engineering and Modelling Group , Wroclaw University of Science and Technology , Wyb.

32,Calculating the Human Eye - The Evolution of Biometry for Cataract Surgery,"Introduction:
      
    

    
      Optical biometry is the standard diagnostic tool and essential basis for IOL calculation prior to cataract surgery today. Our article will provide a short overview of the historical development of biometry of the human eye and the formulas used for IOL calculation. Material and methods:
      
    

    
      Selective literature search in books and journal articles via PubMed, Google Scholar and Google as well as close cooperation with IOLCon at Saarland University, Homburg/Saar (Germany). Results:
      
    

    
      For first measurements of the eye, ultrasound was applied invasively. Today, ultrasound is mostly restricted to cases where optical biometry cannot be performed due to opaque optical media. However, today, most of the modern biometers are working with OCT non-invasively. Along with this technical evolution, numerous formulas have been developed for calculating the optical power of each respective IOL. Intraocular lenses can be calculated with different strategies: with empirical formulas, the IOL power is derived from a series of biometric data without any anatomical or physical background. With the theoretical-optical formulas, which are most commonly used today, the IOL power is extracted from a paraxial optical model which simplifies the eye to linear Gaussian optics. With modern raytracing settings, the Snell's law is applied at each refracting surface within the eye and the best focus position is compared with the position of the fovea. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Today, an increasing number of eyes that underwent refractive surgery previously are facing cataract surgery. Maybe even more important than adequate biometry of the human eye will be using appropriate calculation schemes in order to enhance post-cataract refractive outcomes or predictability.","['1 Institut für Experimentelle Ophthalmologie, Universität des Saarlandes - Campus Homburg, Homburg.']","Sibylle Katharina Scholtz, Achim Langenbucher, ",Klinische Monatsblatter fur Augenheilkunde,2020 Aug,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31600819
33,Selective Uropathogenic E. coli Detection Using Crossed Surface-Relief Gratings,"Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the major burdens on public healthcare worldwide. One of the primary causes of UTIs is the invasion of the urinary tract by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). Improper treatment of bacterial infections like UTIs with broad-spectrum antibiotics has contributed to the rise of antimicrobial resistance, necessitating the development of an inexpensive, rapid and accurate detection of UPEC. Here, we present real-time, selective and label-free detection of UPEC using crossed surface-relief gratings (CSRGs) as nanometallic sensors incorporated into an optical sensing platform. CSRGs enable real-time sensing due to their unique surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based light energy exchange, resulting in detection of a very-narrow-bandwidth SPR signal after the elimination of residual incident light. The platform's sensing ability is experimentally demonstrated by the detection of bulk refractive index (RI) changes, with a bulk sensitivity of 382.2 nm/RIU and a resolution in the order of 10-6 RIU. We also demonstrate, for the first time, CSRG-based real-time selective capture and detection of UPEC in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution, in clinically relevant concentrations, as opposed to other UTI-causing Gram-negative bacteria. The platform's detection limit is calculated to be 10⁵ CFU/mL (concentration on par with the clinical threshold for UTI diagnosis), with a dynamic range spanning four orders of magnitude. This work paves the way for the development of inexpensive point-of-care diagnosis devices focusing on effective treatment of UTIs, which are a burden on public healthcare due to the rise in the number of cases and their recurrences in the recent past.","[""1 Department of Chemical Engineering, Queen's University, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada. srijit.nair@queensu.ca."", ""2 Department of Chemical Engineering, Queen's University, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada. juanmanu04@gmail.com."", '3 Instituto de Ciencias Aplicadas y Desarrollo Tecnológico (ICAT), Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), Ciudad de México 04510, Mexico. juanmanu04@gmail.com.', '4 Departamento de Salud Pública, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), Ciudad de México 04510, Mexico. hangel@unam.mx.', '5 Unidad Periférica de Patogénesis Bacteriana en Hospital General Dr. Manuel Gea González, Ciudad de México 14080, Mexico. hangel@unam.mx.', '6 Instituto de Ciencias Aplicadas y Desarrollo Tecnológico (ICAT), Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), Ciudad de México 04510, Mexico. gabriel.ascanio@ccadet.unam.mx.', '7 Department of Physics and Space Science, Royal Military College of Canada, Kingston, ON K7K 7B4, Canada. sabat@rmc.ca.', ""8 Department of Chemical Engineering, Queen's University, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada. ce32@queensu.ca.""]","Srijit Nair, Juan Gomez-Cruz, Ángel Manjarrez-Hernandez, Gabriel Ascanio, Ribal Georges Sabat, Carlos Escobedo, ","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2018,biosensing; crossed surface-relief gratings; nanoplasmonics; surface plasmon resonance; surface-relief gratings; urinary tract infection; uropathogenic E. coli.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30373136

Methods:
      
    

    
      The framework of probability-generating functions (PGF) is used to find a simple method to derive the MTF and the DQE directly from a Monte-Carlo model of the detection process. Results:
      
    

    
      In combination with realistic model parameters for the detector, the method is used to predict the MTF and the DQE for different pixel sizes and thresholds.

      To evaluate the neutron dose equivalent produced by photoneutrons inside the primary barriers of a radiotherapy vault. Methods:
      
    

    
      Monte Carlo simulations were performed for investigating the production of photoneutrons as well as neutron shielding requirements. Two photon beams of 15 and 18 MV struck sheets of steel and lead, and the neutron doses were calculated at the isocenter (Piso) and at a distance of 50 cm from the inside wall (Pwall) while delivering 1 Gy to the patient. The proper thicknesses of borated polyethylene (BPE) and concrete were simulated to reduce neutron contamination. Results:
      
    

    
      When the primary barrier consisted of a concrete alone, the neutron doses at Piso were 0.5 μSv/Gy and 12.8 μSv/Gy for 15- and 18-MV, respectively. At Pwall, the neutron doses were 15.8 μSv/Gy and 318.4 μSv/Gy for 15- and 18-MV, respectively. When 15 MV photons interacted with metal sheets, the neutron doses were 0.4-22.2 μSv/Gy at Piso and 15.8-812.5 μSv/Gy at Pwall, depending on the thickness and material of the metal sheets and neutron shielding. In the case of 18 MV photons with the same configuration, the neutron doses were 0.9-59.5 μSv/Gy and 73.9-5006.1 μSv/Gy for Piso and Pwall, respectively. The neutron dose delivered to the patient was reduced to the level of the dose delivered with a concrete barrier by including a 10-cm-thick BPE for each beam. Conclusions:

39,Generic and reversible opto-trapping of biomolecules,"Molecular traps can control activity and abundance of many biological factors. Here, we report the development of a generic opto-trap to reversibly bind and release biomolecules with high spatiotemporal control by illumination with non-invasive and cell-compatible red and far-red light. We use the Arapidopsis thaliana photoreceptor phytochrome B to regulate the release of diverse proteins from a variety of material scaffolds. Fusion of a short 100 amino acids ""PIF-tag"", derived from the phytochrome interacting factor 6, renders arbitrary molecules opto-trap-compatible. Reversible opto-trapping of target molecules enables novel possibilities for future developments in diagnostics, therapeutics, and basic research. Statement of significance:
      
    

    
      The investigation of cellular signaling events or the development of complex therapeutics and integrative diagnostic devices requires the deliberate control of biomolecule abundance and activity. During recent years, the use of natural photoreceptors within cells leveraged the control of diverse cellular events, benefiting from the superior spatial and temporal control characteristics of light as compared to conventional chemical stimuli. Concurrently, biological switches entailing intrinsic compatibility toward biological environments increasingly found application in biohybrid materials. We employ the plant red/far-red photoreceptor phytochrome B, which reversibly interacts with its phytochrome interacting factors (PIFs), for developing a generic opto-trap. This platform allows the use of red and far-red light to spatiotemporally control binding and release of arbitrary PIF-fused biomolecules from various material scaffolds.","['1 Faculty of Biology, University of Freiburg, 79104 Freiburg, Germany; SGBM - Spemann Graduate School of Biology and Medicine, University of Freiburg, 79104 Freiburg, Germany; BIOSS - Centre for Biological Signalling Studies, University of Freiburg, 79104 Freiburg, Germany.', '2 Faculty of Biology, University of Freiburg, 79104 Freiburg, Germany.', '3 Institute of Synthetic Biology and CEPLAS, Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf, 40225 Düsseldorf, Germany.', '4 Faculty of Biology, University of Freiburg, 79104 Freiburg, Germany; SGBM - Spemann Graduate School of Biology and Medicine, University of Freiburg, 79104 Freiburg, Germany; BIOSS - Centre for Biological Signalling Studies, University of Freiburg, 79104 Freiburg, Germany.

40,Electro-plasmonic nanoantenna: A nonfluorescent optical probe for ultrasensitive label-free detection of electrophysiological signals,"Harnessing the unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution capability of light to detect electrophysiological signals has been the goal of scientists for nearly 50 years. Yet, progress toward that goal remains elusive due to lack of electro-optic translators that can efficiently convert electrical activity to high photon count optical signals. Here, we introduce an ultrasensitive and extremely bright nanoscale electric-field probe overcoming the low photon count limitations of existing optical field reporters. Our electro-plasmonic nanoantennas with drastically enhanced cross sections (~104 nm2 compared to typical values of ~10-2 nm2 for voltage-sensitive fluorescence dyes and ~1 nm2 for quantum dots) offer reliable detection of local electric-field dynamics with remarkably high sensitivities and signal-to-shot noise ratios (~60 to 220) from diffraction-limited spots.

Here we show that, counter-intuitively, a large imaginary part of material permittivity contributes positively to subwavelength light enhancement and confinement. The Purcell factor and the fluorescence enhancement of dissipative dielectric bowtie nanoantennas, such as Si in ultraviolet (UV), are demonstrated to be orders of magnitude higher than their lossless dielectric counterparts, which is particularly favorable in deep UV applications where metals are plasmonically inactive. The loss-facilitated field enhancement is the result of a large material property contrast and an electric field discontinuity. These dissipative dielectric nanostructures can be easily achieved with a great variety of dielectrics at their Lorentz oscillation frequencies, thus having the potential to build a completely new material platform boosting light-matter interaction over broader frequency ranges, with advantages such as bio-compatibility, CMOS compatibility, and harsh environment endurance.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Kaichen Dong, Yang Deng, Xi Wang, Kyle B Tom, Zheng You, Jie Yao, ",Optics letters,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29652374
43,Optical and x-ray technology synergies enabling diagnostic and therapeutic applications in medicine,"X-ray and optical technologies are the two central pillars for human imaging and therapy. The strengths of x-rays are deep tissue penetration, effective cytotoxicity, and the ability to image with robust projection and computed-tomography methods. The major limitations of x-ray use are the lack of molecular specificity and the carcinogenic risk. In comparison, optical interactions with tissue are strongly scatter dominated, leading to limited tissue penetration, making imaging and therapy largely restricted to superficial or endoscopically directed tissues. However, optical photon energies are comparable with molecular energy levels, thereby providing the strength of intrinsic molecular specificity. Additionally, optical technologies are highly advanced and diversified, being ubiquitously used throughout medicine as the single largest technology sector. Both have dominant spatial localization value, achieved with optical surface scanning or x-ray internal visualization, where one often is used with the other. Therapeutic delivery can also be enhanced by their synergy, where radio-optical and optical-radio interactions can inform about dose or amplify the clinical therapeutic value. An emerging trend is the integration of nanoparticles to serve as molecular intermediates or energy transducers for imaging and therapy, requiring careful design for the interaction either by scintillation or Cherenkov light, and the nanoscale design is impacted by the choices of optical interaction mechanism. The enhancement of optical molecular sensing or sensitization of tissue using x-rays as the energy source is an important emerging field combining x-ray tissue penetration in radiation oncology with the molecular specificity and packaging of optical probes or molecular localization. The ways in which x-rays can enable optical procedures, or optics can enable x-ray procedures, provide a range of new opportunities in both diagnostic and therapeutic medicine. Taken together, these two technologies form the basis for the vast majority of diagnostics and therapeutics in use in clinical medicine.","['1 Dartmouth College, Thayer School of Engineering, Geisel School of Medicine, Hanover, New Hampshire, United States.', '2 University of Toronto, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre/University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']","Brian W Pogue, Brian C Wilson, ",Journal of biomedical optics,2018 Oct,imaging; optics; photo medicine; radiotherapy; spectroscopy; x ray.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30350489

The influence of the laser power and mucin concentration on the motion of the microspheres is investigated in terms of instant and average velocities on a 250-μm trajectory, corresponding to the mucus thickness in the human gastrointestinal tract. Increasing the laser power leads to higher velocities in all the tested samples, while increasing the mucin concentration leads to significant velocity decrease for similar laser input power. However, velocities of up to 95 μm · s - 1 are demonstrated in a 5% mucin simple mucus model using our catapulting system. This study contributes to understanding and overcoming the challenges of optical manipulation in mucus models.

      The purpose of this study was to analyze and to compare results regarding the penumbra size, flatness and symmetry obtained using six different measuring systems. Methods:
      
    

    
      Beam profile measurements were performed in standard water phantom set-up for two photon beams for various square field sizes and for five electron beams for several applicator sizes at several depths. Six measuring systems were used: three ionization chambers; a Semiflex (31002, PTW), a Markus (23343, PTW) and a Roos (34001, PTW); Two semiconductor detectors; a p-type diode (60008, PTW) and an e-type diode (60017, PTW) and a one dimensional Linear Array (LA48, PTW). Results:
      
    

    
      Our results indicate that penumbra size determination is strongly dependent on the measuring system. For the photon measurements the diodes showed the narrowest penumbra followed by the LA48, while the largest penumbra was presented by the Semiflex. The unshielded diode overestimates the penumbra in large field sizes and big depths. The parallel plate ionization chambers overestimate the penumbra width of electron beam profiles. The LA48 presents the most symmetric beam profiles. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Regarding penumbra size determination, the LA48 can be considered acceptable in terms of accuracy, and is the most time-effective system. It is also adequate for symmetry and flatness measurements. For greatest possible accuracy silicon diode is recommended. Parallel plate ionization chambers are not appropriate for penumbra measurements.","[""1 2nd Department of Radiology, University Hospital 'Attikon', School of Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, 12462, Greece.""]","George D Patatoukas, Pantelis Kalavrezos, Ioannis Seimenis, Maria Dilvoi, Vasileios Kouloulias, Efstathios Efstathopoulos, Kalliopi Platoni, ",Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology,Sep-Oct 2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30570872

This work presents a fundamentally different concept to address such scenarios using a self-replenishing and optogenetically controlled living material. It consists of a hydrogel containing an active endotoxin-free Escherichia coli strain. The bacteria are metabolically and optogenetically engineered to secrete the antimicrobial and antitumoral drug deoxyviolacein in a light-regulated manner. The permeable hydrogel matrix sustains a viable and functional bacterial population and permits diffusion and delivery of the synthesized drug to the surrounding medium at quantities regulated by light dose. Using a focused light beam, the site for synthesis and delivery of the drug can be freely defined.

51,Optical techniques for breath analysis: from single to multi-species detection,"Optical spectroscopy can be used for trace-level gas analysis in different applications, including exhaled breath research. A common approach is the targeted on-line, real-time analysis of small molecules (two to five atoms). Currently, the methodology is normally used for the detection of single analytes at trace levels, or two to three species at most at the same time. The main limitation preventing sensitive multi-species detection has been the limited fast scanning range of the lasers used as light sources. This limitation is currently being eliminated by the availability of optical frequency combs (OFC) which offer wide spectral bandwidths and the benefits of a laser-type light source. Recent advances in mid-infrared OFC technology allow measurements in the so-called molecular fingerprint region of the electromagnetic spectrum, where many molecules have strong fundamental vibrational transitions that enable sensitive detection. Several technical hurdles remain to be overcome, but if these problems can be solved laser absorption spectroscopy has the potential to challenge mass spectrometry in on-line multi-species trace gas analysis.","['1 Department of Chemistry, PO Box 55 (A.I.

Currently, however, soft solid and fluid material systems still represent an underutilized class of materials in the optical engineers' toolbox. This is in part due to challenges in fabrication, integration, and structural control on the nano- and microscale associated with the application of soft components in optics. These challenges might be addressed with the help of a resourceful ally: nature. Organisms from many different phyla have evolved an impressive arsenal of light manipulation strategies that rely on the ability to generate and dynamically reconfigure hierarchically structured, complex optical material designs, often involving soft or fluid components. A comprehensive understanding of design concepts, structure formation principles, material integration, and control mechanisms employed in biological photonic systems will allow this study to challenge current paradigms in optical technology.

This study is aimed to determine the OPF in a small field using 10-MV photon beam and stereotactic conical collimator (cone). The OPF was measured by two diode detectors (SFD, EDGE detector) and one micro-ion chamber (PinPoint 3D chamber) in a water phantom. A Monte Carlo simulation using simplified detector model was performed to obtain the correction factor for the detector measurements. About 12% OPF difference was observed in the measurement at the smallest field (7.5 mm diameter) for EDGE detector and PinPoint 3D chamber. By applying the Monte Carlo-based correction factor to the measurement, the maximum discrepancy among the three detectors was reduced to within 3%. The results indicate that determination of OPF in a small field should be carefully performed.

Plasmonics can naturally interface photonics with electronics while offering strong mode confinement, enabling in this way on-chip data interconnects when tailored to single-mode waveguides, as well as high-sensitivity biosensors when exposing Surface-Plasmon-Polariton (SPP) modes in aqueous environment. Their synergy with low-loss photonics can tolerate the high plasmonic propagation losses in interconnect applications, offering at the same time a powerful portfolio of passive photonic functions towards avoiding the use of bulk optics for SPP excitation and facilitating compact biosensor setups. The co-integration roadmap has to proceed, however, over the utilization of fully CMOS compatible material platforms and manufacturing processes in order to allow for a practical deployment route. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time Aluminum plasmonic waveguides co-integrated with Si3N4 photonics using CMOS manufacturing processes. We validate the data carrying credentials of CMOS plasmonics with 25 Gb/s data traffic and we confirm successful plasmonic propagation in both air and water-cladded waveguide configurations.

59,"Artificial intelligence in cornea, refractive, and cataract surgery","Purpose of review:
      
    

    
      The subject of artificial intelligence has recently been responsible for the advancement of many industries including aspects of medicine and many of its subspecialties. Within ophthalmology, artificial intelligence technology has found ways of improving the diagnostic and therapeutic processes in cornea, glaucoma, retina, and cataract surgery. As demands on the modern ophthalmologist grow, artificial intelligence can be utilized to help address increased demands of modern medicine and ophthalmology by adding to the physician's clinical and surgical acumen. The purpose of this review is to highlight the integration of artificial intelligence into ophthalmology in recent years in the areas of cornea, refractive, and cataract surgery. Recent findings:
      
    

    
      Within the realms of cornea, refractive, and cataract surgery, artificial intelligence has played a major role in identifying ways of improving diagnostic detection. In keratoconus, artificial intelligence algorithms may help with the early detection of keratoconus and other ectatic disorders. In cataract surgery, artificial intelligence may help improve the performance of intraocular lens (IOL) calculation formulas. Further, with its potential integration into automated refraction devices, artificial intelligence can help provide an improved framework for IOL formula optimization that is more accurate and customized to a specific cataract surgeon. Summary:
      
    

    
      The future of artificial intelligence in ophthalmology is a promising prospect. With continued advancement of mathematical and computational algorithms, corneal disease processes can be diagnosed sooner and IOL calculations can be made more accurate.","['1 Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York City, New York.', '2 Wilmer Eye Institute, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore.', '3 Maryland Eye Consultants & Surgeons, Silver Spring, Maryland, USA.']","Aazim A Siddiqui, John G Ladas, Jimmy K Lee, ",Current opinion in ophthalmology,2020 Jul,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32487811
60,Hyperthermia with photon radiotherapy is thermoradiobiologically analogous to neutrons for tumors without enhanced normal tissue toxicity,"The depth dose profiles of photons mirror those of fast neutrons. However, in contrast to the high linear energy transfer (LET) characteristics of neutrons; photons exhibit low LET features. Hyperthermia (HT) inhibits the repair of radiation-induced DNA damage and is cytotoxic to the radioresistant hypoxic tumor cells. Thus, thermoradiobiologically, HT simulates high LET radiation with photons. At temperatures of 39-45 °C, the physiological vasodilation allows rapid heat dissipation from normal tissues. On the contrary, the chaotic and relatively rigid tumor vasculature results in heat retention leading to higher intratumoural temperatures. Consequently, the high LET attributes of HT with photon radiations are mostly limited to the confines of the heated tumor while the normothermic normal tissues would be irradiated with low LET photons. HT thereby augments photon therapy by conferring therapeutic advantages of high LET radiations to the tumors akin to neutrons, while the 'heat-sink' effect spares the normal tissues from thermal radiosensitization. Thus, photon thermoradiotherapy imparts radiobiological advantages selectively to tumors analogous to neutrons without exaggerating normal tissue morbidities. The later has been the major concern with clinical fast neutron beam therapy. Outcomes reported from several clinical trials in diverse tumor sites add testimony to the enhanced therapeutic efficacy of photon thermoradiotherapy.","['1 Department of Radiation Oncology, KSA-KSB, Kantonsspital Aarau, Aarau, Switzerland.', '2 Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.']","Niloy Ranjan Datta, Stephan Bodis, ","International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",2019,Hyperthermia; neutrons; photons; radiobiology; radiotherapy.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31709846
61,Occurrence and mechanism of visual phosphenes in external photon beam radiation therapy and how to influence them,"Background and purpose:
      
    

    
      Two plausible mechanisms to explain the appearance of visual phosphenes are: direct activation of the photochemicals in the retina and the generation of Cherenkov radiation in the vitreous humour. In this clinical trial we investigated the occurrence of visual phosphenes in external photon beam radiation therapy. Material and methods:
      
    

    
      Logistic regression analysis is used to examine whether seeing light flashes and seeing steady light depended on the ambient light intensity and the dose. Results:
      
    

    
      In total, 465 treatments of 25 patients were analysed. The odds of seeing light flashes multiply by 0,926 as the ambient light intensity increases by 10 lux. Similarly, the odds multiply by 1,604 as the dose to the retina increases by 10 cGy. The odds of seeing steady light multiply by 1,540 as the dose to the vitreous humour increases by 10 cGy. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We postulate that one should reduce the dose rate, instruct patients to keep the eyes open and increase the illuminance in the treatment room to reduce the probability of experiencing visual phosphenes. We hypothesize that melanopsin is involved in the visual phosphenes and that fatigue of patients might be correlated with the observation of visual phosphenes.","['1 Instituut Verbeeten, Tilburg, The Netherlands.

The concept of our work relies on stackable scaffolds composed of microcontainers designed and dimensioned to favor the geometrically constrained growth of cells. The container geometry allows cells to communicate in the culture medium and freely grow their projections to form a 3D arrangement of living cells. Scaffolds are fabricated using two-photon polymerization of IP-L 780 photoresist and are coated with collagen. They are stacked by mechanical micromanipulation. Technical details of the proposed nanofabrication scheme and assembly of the modular culture environment are explained. Preliminary in vitro results using PC12 cells have shown that this structure provides a good basis for healthy cell growth for at least 16 days. Our approach is envisioned to provide tailor-made solutions of future 3D cell assemblies for potential applications in drug screening or creating artificial organs.","['1 Department of Microsystems Engineering (IMTEK), University of Freiburg, Germany.']","Florian Larramendy, Shotaro Yoshida, Daniela Maier, Zoltan Fekete, Shoji Takeuchi, Oliver Paul, ",Lab on a chip,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30723853

      To determine the effects of age on perifoveal cone density in healthy subjects using adaptive optics. Methods:
      
    

    
      Healthy subjects of various ages were imaged using an adaptive optics retinal camera (RTX-1® Imagine Eyes, Orsay, France). All patients underwent a comprehensive ophthalmologic examination and retinal imaging using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (Spectralis®, Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany). Cone density together with cone spacing and cone mosaic packing were measured in the nasal and temporal area 450 µm from the fovea. A multivariate analysis was performed to determine which of the following parameters were related to a decrease in cone density: age, axial length, central macular thickness, and retrofoveal choroidal thickness. Results:
      
    

    
      One hundred and sixty-seven eyes of 101 subjects aged 6-78 years were studied. Perifoveal cone density significantly decreased with age (R2 = 0.17, p<0.01). Inversely, cone spacing increased with age (R2=0.18, p<0.01). There was no change in the cone packing mosaic (p>0.05). The mean coefficient of variation between fellow eyes was 3.9%. Age and axial length were related to a cone density decrease, while choroidal and retinal thicknesses did not affect cone metrics in healthy subjects. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      A moderate perifoveal cone loss occurs with age. The precise consequences of these findings on visual function should be investigated. In addition to a better understanding of normal retinal anatomy, these results could act as a comparative database for further studies on normal and diseased retinas.","['1 Ophthalmology Department, University Hospital of Besançon, Besançon, Franche-Comté, France. tumahaiperle@gmail.com.', '2 Ophthalmology Department, University Hospital of Besançon, Besançon, Franche-Comté, France.']","P Tumahai, C Moureaux, M Meillat, G Debellemanière, M Flores, B Delbosc, M Saleh, ","Eye (London, England)",2018 Nov,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29993035

We present an advanced optical neuroimaging methodology that can objectively and successfully classify subjects with different expertise levels associated with bimanual motor dexterity. The methodology was tested by assessing laparoscopic surgery skills within the framework of the fundamentals of a laparoscopic surgery program, which is a prerequisite for certification in general surgery. We demonstrate that optical-based metrics outperformed current metrics for surgical certification in classifying subjects with varying surgical expertise. Moreover, we report that optical neuroimaging allows for the successful classification of subjects during the acquisition of these skills.","['1 Department of Biomedical Engineering, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY 12180, USA.', '2 Department of Radiology, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA.', '3 Department of Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, USA.', '4 University at Buffalo School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Buffalo, NY 14260, USA.']","Arun Nemani, Meryem A Yücel, Uwe Kruger, Denise W Gee, Clairice Cooper, Steven D Schwaitzberg, Suvranu De, Xavier Intes, ",Science advances,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30306130
66,Modelling recurrence and second cancer risks induced by proton therapy,"In the past few years, proton therapy has taken the centre stage in treating various tumour types. The primary contribution of this study is to investigate the tumour control probability (TCP), relapse time and the corresponding secondary cancer risks induced by proton beam radiation therapy. We incorporate tumour relapse kinetics into the TCP framework and calculate the associated second cancer risks. To calculate proton therapy-induced secondary cancer induction, we used the well-known biologically motivated mathematical model, initiation-inactivation-proliferation formalism. We used the available in vitro data for the linear energy transfer (LET) dependence of cell killing and mutation induction parameters. We evaluated the TCP and radiation-induced second cancer risks for protons in the clinical range of LETs, i.e. approximately 8 $\mathrm{keV/\mu m}$ for the tumour volume and 1-3 $\mathrm{keV/\mu m}$ for the organs at risk. This study may serve as a framework for further work in this field and elucidates proton-induced TCP and the associated secondary cancer risks, not previously reported in the literature. Although studies with a greater number of cell lines would reduce uncertainties within the model parameters, we argue that the theoretical framework presented within is a sufficient rationale to assess proton radiation TCP, relapse and carcinogenic effects in various treatment plans. We show that compared with photon therapy, proton therapy markedly reduces the risk of secondary malignancies and for equivalent dosing regimens achieves better tumour control as well as a reduced primary recurrence outcome, especially within a hypo-fractionated regimen.","['1 Princess Margaret Cancer Center, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', '2 Department of Oncology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.']","V S K Manem, A Dhawan, ",Mathematical medicine and biology : a journal of the IMA,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29106564

68,Shining Light on Chitosan: A Review on the Usage of Chitosan for Photonics and Nanomaterials Research,"Chitosan (CS) is a natural polymer derived from chitin that has found its usage both in research and commercial applications due to its unique solubility and chemical and biological attributes. The biocompatibility and biodegradability of CS have helped researchers identify its utility in the delivery of therapeutic agents, tissue engineering, wound healing, and more. Industrial applications include cosmetic and personal care products, wastewater treatment, and corrosion protection, to name a few. Many researchers have published numerous reviews outlining the physical and chemical properties of CS, as well as its use for many of the above-mentioned applications. Recently, the cationic polyelectrolyte nature of CS was found to be advantageous for stabilizing fascinating photonic materials including plasmonic nanoparticles (e.g., gold and silver), semiconductor nanoparticles (e.g., zinc oxide, cadmium sulfide), fluorescent organic dyes (e.g., fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)), luminescent transitional and lanthanide complexes (e.g., Au(I) and Ru(II), and Eu(III)). These photonic systems have been extensively investigated for their usage in antimicrobial, wound healing, diagnostics, sensing, and imaging applications. Highlighted in this review are the different works involving some of the above-mentioned molecular-nano systems that are prepared or stabilized using the CS polymer. The advantages and the role of the CS for synthesizing and stabilizing the above-mentioned optically active materials have been illustrated.","['1 Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas, Denton, TX 76203, USA. sreekarbabu.marpu@unt.edu.', '2 Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas, Denton, TX 76203, USA. erinbenton@my.unt.edu.']","Sreekar B Marpu, Erin N Benton, ",International journal of molecular sciences,2018,bioimaging; chitosan; luminescence; nanoparticles; plasmonic nanoparticles; quantum dots; sensors; surface plasmon resonance.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29914214
69,Highly sensitive detection of exosomes by 3D plasmonic photonic crystal biosensor,"In this study, two-dimensional (2D), quasi-three-dimensional (3D), and 3D plasmonic photonic crystal (PPC) nanostructures with point-defect cavities were developed and fabricated using direct and reversal nanoimprint lithography. As a result of the hybrid coupling of localized surface plasmon resonance and Fabry-Perot cavity modes, the quasi-3D plasmonic nanoholes showed higher electromagnetic field intensity and sensitivity than the 2D plasmonic nanoholes. Specifically, the sensitivity of the quasi-3D plasmonic nanoholes was 483 nm per refractive index unit (RIU), whereas that of the 2D plasmonic nanoholes was 276 nm RIU-1. In addition, by enhancing electromagnetic field intensity around corners and generating an additional subradiant dark mode, the symmetrical breakage of the quasi-3D plasmonic nanoholes further increased the sensitivity to 946 nm RIU-1. Among all the nanostructures developed in the study, the 3D PPC nanostructures with point-defect cavities showed the highest sensitivity up to 1376 nm RIU-1 and highest figure of merit of 11.6 as the result of the hybrid coupling of plasmonics and photonic crystal modes with multilayered plasmonic nanostructures. The spacing between the 3D PPC nanostructures was comparable with the average size of exosomes derived from fibroblast L cells, which allowed the exosomes to spread around the 3D PPC nanostructures with increased sensing area. This effect further enhanced the detection sensitivity with a large peak shift of 9 nm when using the 3D PPC biosensor to detect exosomes at the concentration of 1 × 104 particles per ml, and the peak shift increased to 102 nm as exosome concentration increased to 1 × 1011 particles per ml.","['1 Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China. pang@cityu.edu.hk.']","Shuyan Zhu, Hualin Li, Mengsu Yang, Stella W Pang, ",Nanoscale,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30346006
70,Technical Note: On maximizing Cherenkov emissions from medical linear accelerators,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      Cherenkov light during MV radiotherapy has recently found imaging and therapeutic applications but is challenged by relatively low fluence. Our purpose is to investigate the feasibility of increasing Cherenkov light production during MV radiotherapy by increasing photon energy and applying specialized beam-hardening filtration. Methods:
      
    

    
      GAMOS 5.0.0, a GEANT4-based framework for Monte Carlo simulations, was used to model standard clinical linear accelerator primary photon beams. The photon source was incident upon a 17.8 cm3 cubic water phantom with a 94 cm source to surface distance. Dose and Cherenkov production was determined at depths of 3-9 cm. Filtration was simulated 15 cm below the photon beam source. Filter materials included aluminum, iron, and copper with thicknesses of 2-20 cm. Histories used depended on the level of attenuation from the filter, ranging from 100 million to 2 billion. Comparing average dose per history also allowed for evaluation of dose-rate reduction for different filters. Results:
      
    

    
      Overall, increasing photon beam energy is more effective at improving Cherenkov production per unit dose than is filtration, with a standard 18 MV beam yielding 3.3-4.0× more photons than 6 MV. Introducing an aluminum filter into an unfiltered 2400 cGy/min 10 MV beam increases the Cherenkov production by 1.6-1.7×, while maintaining a clinical dose rate of 300 cGy/min, compared to increases of ~1.5× for iron and copper. Aluminum was also more effective than the standard flattening filter, with the increase over the unfiltered beam being 1.4-1.5× (maintaining 600 cGy/min dose rate) vs 1.3-1.4× for the standard flattening filter. Applying a 10 cm aluminum filter to a standard 18 MV, photon beam increased the Cherenkov production per unit dose to 3.9-4.3× beyond that of 6 MV (vs 3.3-4.0× for 18 MV with no aluminum filter). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Through a combination of increasing photon energy and applying specialized beam-hardening filtration, the amount of Cherenkov photons per unit radiotherapy dose can be increased substantially.","['1 Medical Physics Graduate Program, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, 27708, USA.', '2 Radiation Dosimetry Laboratory, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, 27708, USA.', '3 Department of Radiation Oncology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, 27708, USA.']","Zachary Shrock, Suk W Yoon, Rathnayaka Gunasingha, Mark Oldham, Justus Adamson, ",Medical physics,2018 Jul,GAMOS; RDT; RECA; Cherenkov; Psoralen.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29672860

Basic essentials such as food, beverages, clothes and domestic materials are enriched by the agricultural industry. However, the traditional method in agriculture cultivation is labor-intensive and inadequate to meet the accelerating nature of human demands. This scenario raises the need to explore state-of-the-art crop cultivation and harvesting technologies. In this regard, optics and photonics technologies have proven to be effective solutions. This paper aims to present a comprehensive review of three photonic techniques, namely imaging, spectroscopy and spectral imaging, in a comparative manner for agriculture applications. Essentially, the spectral imaging technique is a robust solution which combines the benefits of both imaging and spectroscopy but faces the risk of underutilization. This review also comprehends the practicality of all three techniques by presenting existing examples in agricultural applications. Furthermore, the potential of these techniques is reviewed and critiqued by looking into agricultural activities involving palm oil, rubber, and agro-food crops. All the possible issues and challenges in implementing the photonic techniques in agriculture are given prominence with a few selective recommendations. The highlighted insights in this review will hopefully lead to an increased effort in the development of photonics applications for the future agricultural industry.","['1 Institute of Power Engineering, College of Engineering, Universiti Tenaga Nasional, Kajang 43000, Selangor, Malaysia. adrian_tan_jy@hotmail.com.', '2 Institute of Power Engineering, College of Engineering, Universiti Tenaga Nasional, Kajang 43000, Selangor, Malaysia. pinjern@uniten.edu.my.', '3 Institute of Power Engineering, College of Engineering, Universiti Tenaga Nasional, Kajang 43000, Selangor, Malaysia. kylau@uniten.edu.my.', '4 Institute of Power Engineering, College of Engineering, Universiti Tenaga Nasional, Kajang 43000, Selangor, Malaysia.

74,Shatter and splatter: The contribution of mechanical and optical properties to the perception of soft and hard breaking materials,"Research on the visual perception of materials has mostly focused on the surface qualities of rigid objects. The perception of substance like materials is less explored. Here, we investigated the contribution of, and interaction between, surface optics and mechanical properties to the perception of nonrigid, breaking materials. We created novel animations of materials ranging from soft to hard bodies that broke apart differently when dropped. In Experiment 1, animations were rendered as point-light movies varying in dot density, as well as ""full-cue"" optical versions ranging from translucent glossy to opaque matte under a natural illumination field. Observers used a scale to rate each substance on different attributes. In Experiment 2 we investigated how much shape contributed to ratings of the full-cue stimuli in Experiment 1, by comparing ratings when observers were shown movies versus one frame of the animation. The results showed that optical and mechanical properties had an interactive effect on ratings of several material attributes. We also found that motion and static cues each provided a lot of information about the material qualities; however, when combined, they influenced observers' ratings interactively. For example, in some conditions, motion dominated over optical information; in other conditions, it enhanced the effect of optics. Our results suggest that rating multiple attributes is an effective way to measure underlying perceptual differences between nonrigid breaking materials, and this study is the first to our knowledge to show interactions between optical and mechanical properties in a task involving judgments of perceptual qualities.","['1 Department of Psychology, Justus-Liebig-University, Giessen, Germany.']","Alexandra C Schmid, Katja Doerschner, ",Journal of vision,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29362807
75,Confined photo-release of nitric oxide with simultaneous two-photon fluorescence tracking in a cellular system,"Nitric oxide (NO) is a key signaling molecule in biological systems. New tools are required to therapeutically modulate NO levels with confined precision. This study explores the photoactivatable properties of an NO releasing compound (CPA), based on cupferron O-alkylated with an anthracene derivative. Upon light stimulation, CPA uncages two species: cupferron, which liberates NO, and an anthrylmethyl carbocation, which evolves into a fluorescent reporter. Proof-of-principle is demonstrated using one- and two-photon excitation (1PE and 2PE) in a cellular system (A431 cells). It was found that 1PE induces cell toxicity, while 2PE does not. Since 1PE using UV light is more likely to generate cellular photodamage, the cell toxicity observed using 1PE is most likely a combinatory effect of NO release and other UV-induced damage, which should be subject to further investigation. On the other hand, absence of phototoxicity using 2PE suggests that NO alone is not cytotoxic. This leads to the conclusion that the concept of 2PE photorelease of NO from CPA enable opportunities for biological studies of NO signaling with confined precision of NO release with minimal cytotoxicity.","['1 University of Gothenburg, Department of Chemistry and Molecular Biology, Biomedical Photonics Group, Gothenburg, 412 96, Sweden.', '2 University of Catania, Department of Drug Sciences, Laboratory of Photochemistry, Catania, 95125, Italy.', '3 STMicroelectronics, Catania, 95121, Italy.', '4 University of Catania, Department of Drug Sciences, Laboratory of Photochemistry, Catania, 95125, Italy. ssortino@unict.it.', '5 University of Gothenburg, Department of Chemistry and Molecular Biology, Biomedical Photonics Group, Gothenburg, 412 96, Sweden. marica.ericson@chem.gu.se.']","Hanna Thomsen, Nino Marino, Sabrina Conoci, Salvatore Sortino, Marica B Ericson, ",Scientific reports,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29950654

      Ionization chambers are the detectors of choice for photon beam profile scanning. However, they introduce significant volume averaging effect (VAE) that can artificially broaden the penumbra width by 2-3 mm. The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility of photon beam profile deconvolution (the elimination of VAE from ionization chamber-measured beam profiles) using a three-layer feedforward neural network. Methods:
      
    

    
      Transverse beam profiles of photon fields between 2 × 2 and 10 × 10 cm2 were collected with both a CC13 ionization chamber and an EDGE diode detector on an Elekta Versa HD accelerator. These profiles were divided into three datasets (training, validation and test) to train and test a three-layer feedforward neural network. A sliding window was used to extract input data from the CC13-measured profiles. The neural network produced the deconvolved value at the center of the sliding window. The full deconvolved profile was obtained after the sliding window was moved over the measured profile from end to end. The EDGE-measured beam profiles were used as reference for the training, validation, and test. The number of input neurons, which equals the sliding window width, and the number of hidden neurons were optimized with a parametric sweeping method. A total of 135 neural networks were fully trained with the Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation algorithm. The one with the best overall performance on the training and validation dataset was selected to test its generalization ability on the test dataset. The agreement between the neural network-deconvolved profiles and the EDGE-measured profiles was evaluated with two metrics: mean squared error (MSE) and penumbra width difference (PWD). Results:
      
    

    
      Based on the two-dimensional MSE plots, the optimal combination of sliding window width of 15 and 5 hidden neurons was selected for the final neural network. Excellent agreement was achieved between the neural network-deconvolved profiles and the reference profiles in all three datasets. After deconvolution, the mean PWD reduced from 2.43 ± 0.26, 2.44 ± 0.36, and 2.46 ± 0.29 mm to 0.15 ± 0.15, 0.04 ± 0.03, and 0.14 ± 0.09 mm for the training, validation, and test dataset, respectively. Conclusions:

77,Kilohertz two-photon fluorescence microscopy imaging of neural activity in vivo,"Understanding information processing in the brain requires monitoring neuronal activity at high spatiotemporal resolution. Using an ultrafast two-photon fluorescence microscope empowered by all-optical laser scanning, we imaged neuronal activity in vivo at up to 3,000 frames per second and submicrometer spatial resolution. This imaging method enabled monitoring of both supra- and subthreshold electrical activity down to 345 μm below the brain surface in head-fixed awake mice.","['1 Department of Physics, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.', '2 Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', '3 Janelia Research Campus, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Ashburn, VA, USA.', '4 Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', '5 Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China. tsia@hku.hk.', '6 Department of Physics, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA. jina@berkeley.edu.', '7 Janelia Research Campus, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Ashburn, VA, USA. jina@berkeley.edu.', '8 Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA. jina@berkeley.edu.', '9 Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA. jina@berkeley.edu.', '10 Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA. jina@berkeley.edu.']","Jianglai Wu, Yajie Liang, Shuo Chen, Ching-Lung Hsu, Mariya Chavarha, Stephen W Evans, Dongqing Shi, Michael Z Lin, Kevin K Tsia, Na Ji, ",Nature methods,2020 Mar,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32123392
78,Electron beam collimation with a photon MLC for standard electron treatments,"Standard electron treatments are currently still performed using standard or molded patient-specific cut-outs placed in the electron applicator. Replacing cut-outs and electron applicators with a photon multileaf collimator (pMLC) for electron beam collimation would make standard electron treatments more efficient and would facilitate advanced treatment techniques like modulated electron radiotherapy (MERT) and mixed beam radiotherapy (MBRT). In this work, a multiple source Monte Carlo beam model for pMLC shaped electron beams commissioned at a source-to-surface distance (SSD) of 70 cm is extended for SSDs of up to 100 cm and validated for several Varian treatment units with field sizes typically used for standard electron treatments. Measurements and dose calculations agree generally within 3% of the maximal dose or 2 mm distance to agreement. To evaluate the dosimetric consequences of using pMLC collimated electron beams for standard electron treatments, pMLC-based and cut-out-based treatment plans are created for a left and a right breast boost, a sternum, a testis and a parotid gland case. The treatment plans consist of a single electron field, either alone (1E) or in combination with two 3D conformal tangential photon fields (1E2X). For each case, a pMLC plan with similar treatment plan quality in terms of dose homogeneity to the target and absolute mean dose values to the organs at risk (OARs) compared to a cut-out plan is found. The absolute mean dose to an OAR is slightly increased for pMLC-based compared to cut-out-based 1E plans if the OAR is located laterally close to the target with respect to beam direction, or if a 6 MeV electron beam is used at an extended SSD. In conclusion, treatment plans using cut-out collimation can be replaced by plans of similar treatment plan quality using pMLC collimation with accurately calculated dose distributions.","['1 Division of Medical Radiation Physics and Department of Radiation Oncology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, and University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.']","S Mueller, M K Fix, D Henzen, D Frei, D Frauchiger, K Loessl, M F M Stampanoni, P Manser, ",Physics in medicine and biology,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29214984
79,Ultraflexible Nanowire Array for Label- and Distortion-Free Cellular Force Tracking,"Living cells interact with their immediate environment by exerting mechanical forces, which regulate important cell functions. Elucidation of such force patterns yields deep insights into the physics of life. Here we present a top-down nanostructured, ultraflexible nanowire array biosensor capable of probing cell-induced forces. Its universal building block, an inverted conical semiconductor nanowire, greatly enhances both the functionality and the sensitivity of the device. In contrast to existing cellular force sensing architectures, microscopy is performed on the nanowire heads while cells deflecting the nanowires are confined within the array. This separation between the optical path and the cells under investigation excludes optical distortions caused by cell-induced refraction, which can give rise to feigned displacements on the 100 nm scale. The undistorted nanowire displacements are converted into cellular forces via the nanowire spring constant. The resulting distortion-free cellular force transducer realizes a high-resolution and label-free biosenor based on optical microscopy. Its performance is demonstrated in a proof-of-principle experiment with living Dictyostelium discoideum cells migrating through the nanowire array. Cell-induced forces are probed with a resolution of 50 piconewton, while the most flexible nanowires promise to enter the 100 femtonewton realm.","['1 Center for NanoScience & Faculty of Physics , Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München , Geschwister-Scholl-Platz 1 , 80539 München , Germany.', '2 Fraunhofer Institute for Silicate Research (ISC) , Neunerplatz 2 , 97082 Würzburg , Germany.', '3 Leiden Institute of Physics , Leiden University , 2333 Leiden , The Netherlands.', '4 Department of Physics , Universität Konstanz , 78457 Konstanz , Germany.']","P Paulitschke, F Keber, A Lebedev, J Stephan, H Lorenz, S Hasselmann, D Heinrich, E M Weig, ",Nano letters,2019,Dictyostelium discoideum; Nanowire array; cellular force tracking; label-free biosensing; optical distortions; spring constant.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30427688

With the crystal a monochromatic seed pulse is produced from a broadband XFEL pulse generated in the first undulator section with an optical delay of 119 fs at 10 keV. The small optical delay allows a temporal overlap between the seed optical pulse and the electron bunch by using a small magnetic chicane for the electron beam placed between two undulator sections. Peak reflectivity reached 67%, which is reasonable compared with the theoretical value of 81%. By using this monochromator, a monochromatic seed pulse without broadband background in the spectrum was obtained at SACLA with a conversion efficiency from a broadband XFEL pulse of 2 × 10-2, which is ∼10 times higher than the theoretical efficiency of transmission self-seeding using a thin diamond (400) monochromator.","['1 RIKEN SPring-8 Center, 1-1-1 Kouto, Sayo-cho, Sayo-gun, Hyogo 679-5148, Japan.', '2 Department of Precision Science and Technology, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University, 2-1 Yamada-oka, Suita, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.']","Taito Osaka, Ichiro Inoue, Ryota Kinjo, Takashi Hirano, Yuki Morioka, Yasuhisa Sano, Kazuto Yamauchi, Makina Yabashi, ",Journal of synchrotron radiation,2019,XFELs; channel-cut crystals; self-seeding.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31490137
81,Large energy acceptance gantry for proton therapy utilizing superconducting technology,"When using superconducting (SC) magnets in a gantry for proton therapy, the gantry will benefit from some reduction in size and a large reduction in weight. In this contribution we show an important additional advantage of SC magnets in proton therapy treatments. We present the design of a gantry with a SC bending section and achromatic beam optics with a very large beam momentum acceptance of [Formula: see text]15% (corresponding to about [Formula: see text]30% in the energy domain). Due to the related very large energy acceptance, approximately 70% of the treatments can be performed without changing the magnetic field for synchronization with energy modulation. In our design this is combined with a 2D lateral scanning system and a fast degrader mounted in the gantry, so that this gantry will be able to perform pencil beam scanning with very rapid energy variations at the patient, allowing a significant reduction of the irradiation time. We describe the iterative process we have applied to design the magnets and the beam transport, for which we have used different codes. COSY Infinity and OPAL have been used to design the beam transport optics and to track the particles in the magnetic fields, which are produced by the magnets designed in Opera. With beam optics calculations we have derived an optimal achromatic beam transport with the large momentum acceptance of the proton pencil beam and we show the agreement with particle tracking calculations in the 3D magnetic field map. A new cyclotron based facility with this gantry will have a significantly smaller footprint, since one can refrain from the standard degrader and energy selection system behind the cyclotron. In the treatments, this gantry will enable a very fast proton beam delivery sequence, which may be of advantage for treatments in moving tissue.",['1 Author to whom correspondence should be addressed.'],"K P Nesteruk, C Calzolaio, D Meer, V Rizzoglio, M Seidel, J M Schippers, ",Physics in medicine and biology,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31272087
82,Application of plastic scintillating fibres to surface dosimetry in megavoltage photon and electron beams: considerations for Cerenkov correction,"This work investigated the application of plastic scintillation detectors (PSDs) in dosimetry measurements on the surface of a phantom in megavoltage photon and electron beams. Emission spectra associated with fluorescence in the PMMA optical fibre, Cerenkov in the optical fibre, and the signal from the scintillator were characterized with a spectrophotometer. The angular dependence of the PSD response was studied with the PSD both in the plane and perpendicular to the plane of gantry rotation. Two methods of stem correction were investigated: stem subtraction and full spectral correction. It was found that with the PSD in the plane of gantry rotation, the stem subtraction method overestimates the dose particularly in electrons. The magnitude of overestimation is dependent on the beam energy, scintillator type and the angle of incidence. In this study a maximum error of 12% was observed for 16 MeV with a gantry angle of 45°. It was shown that the cause of this error was a non-negligible emission of Cerenkov radiation from the scintillator itself. This error was not observed when the PSD was oriented perpendicular to the plane of rotation. Similarly, the full spectral method was effective in isolating the scintillation-only signal regardless of PSD orientation.","['1 Department of Radiation Oncology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.

84,Frequency-Encoded Multicolor Fluorescence Imaging with Single-Photon-Counting Color-Blind Detection,"Standard fluorescence microscopy relies on filter-based detection of emitted photons after fluorophore excitation at the appropriate wavelength. Although of enormous utility to the biological community, the implementation of approaches for simultaneous multicolor fluorescence imaging is commonly challenged by the large spectral overlap between different fluorophores. Here, we describe an alternative multicolor fluorescence imaging methodology that exclusively relies on the absorption spectra of the fluorophores instead of their fluorescence emissions. The method is based on multiplexing optical excitation signals in the frequency domain and using single color-blind detection. Because the spectral information is fully encoded during excitation, the method requires minimal spectral filtering on detection. This enables the simultaneous identification of multiple color channels in a single measurement with only one color-blind detector. We demonstrate simultaneous three-color confocal imaging of individual molecules and of four-target imaging on cells with excellent discrimination. Moreover, we have implemented a non-negative matrix factorization algorithm for spectral unmixing to extend the number of color targets that can be discriminated in a single measurement. Using this algorithm, we resolve six spectrally and spatially overlapping fluorophores on fixed cells using four excitation wavelengths. The methodology is fully compatible with live imaging of biological samples and can be easily extended to other imaging modalities, including super-resolution microscopy, making simultaneous multicolor imaging more accessible to the biological research community.","['1 ICFO-Institut de Ciencies Fotoniques, The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, Barcelona, Spain.', '2 ICFO-Institut de Ciencies Fotoniques, The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, Barcelona, Spain; ICREA, Barcelona, Spain.

85,Structure determination from single molecule X-ray scattering with three photons per image,"Scattering experiments with femtosecond high-intensity free-electron laser pulses provide a new route to macromolecular structure determination. While currently limited to nano-crystals or virus particles, the ultimate goal is scattering on single biomolecules. The main challenges in these experiments are the extremely low signal-to-noise ratio due to the very low expected photon count per scattering image, often well below 100, as well as the random orientation of the molecule in each shot. Here we present a de novo correlation-based approach and show that three coherently scattered photons per image suffice for structure determination. Using synthetic scattering data of a small protein, we demonstrate near-atomic resolution of 3.3 Å using 3.3 × 1010 coherently scattered photons from 3.3 × 109 images, which is within experimental reach. Further, our three-photon correlation approach is robust to additional noise from incoherent scattering; the number of disordered solvent molecules attached to the macromolecular surface should be kept small.","['1 Department of Theoretical and Computational Biophysics, Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Am Fassberg 11, 37077, Göttingen, Germany.', '2 Department of Theoretical and Computational Biophysics, Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Am Fassberg 11, 37077, Göttingen, Germany. hgrubmu@mpibpc.mpg.de.']","Benjamin von Ardenne, Martin Mechelke, Helmut Grubmüller, ",Nature communications,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29915244

      To assess the progression of diabetic hard exudates over an 8-week period, using a high-resolution adaptive optics camera. Design:
      
    

    
      Prospective observational study. Methods:
      
    

    
      Five eyes of three patients presenting diabetic maculopathy with hard exudates were studied. An area of clinically visible exudates was imaged sequentially using SD-OCT and high-resolution flood illumination adaptive optics for 2 months, on a weekly basis. A time-lapse video was obtained for each eye studied. Changes in terms of surface, number of free elements (foci), and central macular thickness were recorded. Results:
      
    

    
      Short-term modifications in terms of disposition, size, and number of exudates were observed. Two patterns of progression were identified: two eyes showed exudate dislocation concomitant with the regression of the underlying macular edema, with hard exudates being progressively replaced by a multitude of smaller foci. These exudates were labeled resorption exudates. In three other eyes with persistent diabetic macular edema, foci aggregated into larger exudates. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Diabetic hard exudate changes occurred over a short period of time but were not assessable clinically. Adaptive optics was able to document these subtle changes precisely. Further studies using this imaging modality may improve our understanding of the natural history of exudates and eventually help assess the efficacy of the various treatments available such as lipid-lowering drugs and anti-VEGFs injections.","['1 Department of Ophthalmology, Besançon University Hospital, Besançon, France.', '2 Department of Ophthalmology, Besançon University Hospital, Besançon, France, msaleh@chu-besancon.fr.']","Prisca Loganadane, Bernard Delbosc, Maher Saleh, ",Ophthalmic research,2019,Diabetic macular edema; Hard exudates; High-resolution adaptive optics camera.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30466082

      The aim of the current study was to evaluate the backscatter dose and energy spectrum from the Lipiodol with flattening filter (FF) and flattening filter-free (FFF) beams. Moreover, the backscatter range, that was defined as the backscatter distance (BD) are revealed. Methods:
      
    

    
      6 MVX FF and FFF beams were delivered by TrueBeam. Two dose calculation methods with Monte Carlo calculation were used with a virtual phantom in which the Lipiodol (3 × 3 × 3 cm3 ) was located at a depth of 5.0 cm in a water-equivalent phantom (20 × 20 × 20 cm3 ). The first dose calculation was an analysis of the dose and energy spectrum with the complete scattering of photons and electrons, and the other was a specified dose analysis only with scattering from a specified region. The specified dose analysis was divided into a scattering of primary photons and a scattering of electrons. Results:
      
    

    
      The lower-energy photons contributed to the backscatter, while the high-energy photons contributed the difference of the backscatter dose between the FF and FFF beams. Although the difference in the dose from the scattered electrons between the FF and FFF beams was within 1%, the difference of the dose from the scattered photons between the FF and FFF beams was 5.4% at a depth of 4.98 cm. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The backscatter range from the Lipiodol was within 3 mm and depended on the Compton scatter from the primary photons. The backscatter dose from the Lipiodol can be useful in clinical applications in cases where the backscatter region is located within a tumor.","['1 Radiation Therapy Section, Department of Clinical Support, Hiroshima University Hospital, Hiroshima, Japan.', '2 Department of Radiation Oncology, Institute of Biomedical & Health Sciences, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', '3 Department of Radiation Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Yamaguchi University, Yamaguchi, Japan.']","Daisuke Kawahara, Shuichi Ozawa, Tomoki Kimura, Akito Saito, Takeo Nakashima, Yoshimi Ohno, Yuji Murakami, Yasushi Nagata, Takehiro Shiinoki, ",Journal of applied clinical medical physics,2019 Jun,Lipiodol; backscatter; dose enhancement.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30884060

89,"A physics-based analytical model of absorbed dose from primary, leakage, and scattered photons from megavoltage radiotherapy with MLCs","A burgeoning population of cancer survivors is at risk of late health effects following radiation therapy including second cancers, with the majority of these cancers occurring outside of the treatment volume of the primary cancer. Commercial radiotherapy treatment planning systems underestimate the out-of-field dose. Previous analytical models of out-of-field dose have assumed radial symmetry and/or approximated the dimensions of collimators as semi-infinite planes. The purpose of this work was to develop a physics-based analytical model of total absorbed dose from primary, scattered, and leakage radiation for square fields from a 6 MV beam at any arbitrary point in a phantom, including in-plane, cross-plane, and out-of-plane locations. The model includes the essential physics of radiation transport through beam-limiting-devices including rounded edges of MLC leaves. The model agreed well with measurements and Monte Carlo simulations of absorbed dose in a water-box phantom and was validated for field-sizes ranging from 2 [Formula: see text] 2 to 20 [Formula: see text] 20 cm2. The signed and unsigned average percent differences were [Formula: see text] and 15.9%, respectively, for all points and field-sizes considered. An extended gamma index analysis reveals a 92% pass rate with criteria of 3 mm distance-to-agreement, 3% relative dose difference in-field, and 3 mGy Gy-1 absolute dose difference out-of-field. The average wall-clock time to calculate dose to one million points was 3.3 min. These results suggest that it is feasible to calculate absorbed dose from both therapeutic and stray radiation using physics-based analytical models with good accuracy, thus overcoming a major obstacle to routinely assessing exposures. Additionally, this work demonstrates the importance of relaxing certain simplifications such as assuming a radially symmetric stray-dose distribution. Because the model is physics-based and may be reconfigured according to the dimensions of beam-limiting-devices, adapting it to other treatment units should be straight forward. Uses for such a model include clinical and research applications, such as clinical trials and epidemiological studies.","['1 Department of Physics and Astronomy, Louisiana State University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, LA 70803-4001, United States of America.']","Christopher W Schneider, Wayne D Newhauser, Lydia J Wilson, Ralf-Peter Kapsch, ",Physics in medicine and biology,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31535622

92,Optical probe pressure effects on cutaneous blood flow,"The variation of blood flow characteristics caused by the probe pressure during noninvasive studies is of particular interest within the context of fundamental and applied research. It has been shown previously that the weak local pressure induces vasodilation, whereas the increased pressure is able to stop the blood flow in the compressed area, as well as to significantly change optical signals.The blood flow oscillations measured by laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) characterize the functional state of the microvascular system and can be used for noninvasive diagnostics of its abnormality. This study was intended to identify the patterns of the relationship between the oscillating components of blood flow registered by the LDF method under different levels of pressure applied to an optical fiber probe.For this purpose, we have developed an original optical probe capable of regulating the applied pressure. The developed protocol included six sequential records of the blood perfusion at a pressure within the 0 to 200 mmHg range with unloading at the last stage.Using wavelet analyses, we traced the variation of energy of oscillations for these records in five frequency bands associated with different vascular tone regulation mechanisms. Six young volunteers of the same age (three males and three females) were included in this preliminary study and the protocol was repeated five times in each volunteer. Accordingly, 30 LDF records were available for the analyses. As expected, the LDF signal increases at weak pressure (30 mmHg) and decreases at increased pressure. The statistically stable amplification of endothelial associated blood flow oscillations under the 90 mmHg pressure allowed us to put forward a hypothesis that the endothelial activity increases. The possible causes of this phenomenon are discussed.","['1 Institute of Continuous Media Mechanics of the Ural Branch, RAS, Perm, Russia.', '2 Orel State University Named After I.S.

93,Optimization of combined proton-photon treatments,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      Proton treatment slots are a limited resource. Therefore, we consider combined proton-photon treatments in which most fractions are delivered with photons and only a few with protons. We demonstrate how both modalities can be combined to optimally capitalize on the proton's ability to reduce normal tissue dose. Methods:
      
    

    
      An optimal combined treatment must account for fractionation effects. We therefore perform simultaneous optimization of intensity-modulated proton (IMPT) and photon (IMRT) plans based on their cumulative biologically effective dose (BED). We demonstrate the method for a sacral chordoma patient, in whom the gross tumor volume (GTV) abuts bowel and rectum. Results:
      
    

    
      In an optimal combination, proton and photon fractions deliver similar doses to bowel and rectum to protect these dose-limiting normal tissues through fractionation. However, proton fractions deliver, on average, higher doses to the GTV. Thereby, the photon dose bath is reduced. An optimized 30-fraction treatment with 10 IMPT fractions achieved more than 50% of the integral dose reduction in the gastrointestinal tract that is possible with 30 IMPT fractions (compared to 33% for a simple proton-photon combination in which both modalities deliver the same target dose).

94,Photon dose at the maze entrance door: The comparison of flattening filter and flattening filter free working modes,"In recent years, field flattening free accelerators have been introduced in therapy practice. One of the objective of these measurements was to establish if the maze door, designed for accelerators operating with flattening filter can provide adequate shielding in field flattening free mode of operation. Linac installed in this standard one band maze vault is equipped to operate at 6 MV with field flattening filter and in field flattening free mode of operation. Series of measurements of the photon dose at the maze door (with different jaws openings and gantry positions) were performed in both operation modes with and without water canister to mimic standard therapy conditions. In this paper results of photon dose measurements, performed at the maze door of the therapy linear accelerator vault are presented in order to compare photon dose in flattening filter and flattening filter free operation modes. It was obtained that in field flattening free mode of operation, the dose at the maze door is always lower than the dose measured in standard mode of operation with the field flattening filter. In the case when FFF therapy practice should start in some existing therapy vault, no additional shielding measures need to be added at the existing maze door.","['1 Physics Department, Faculty of Sciences, University of Novi Sad, Novi Sad, Serbia; Oncology Institute of Vojvodina, Sremska Kamenica, Serbia.

95,Light-induced dynamic structural color by intracellular 3D photonic crystals in brown algae,"Natural photonic crystals are responsible for strong reflectance at selective wavelengths in different natural systems. We demonstrate that intracellular opal-like photonic crystals formed from lipids within photosynthetic cells produce vivid structural color in the alga Cystoseira tamariscifolia. The reflectance of the opaline vesicles is dynamically responsive to environmental illumination. The structural color is present in low light-adapted samples, whereas higher light levels produce a slow disappearance of the structural color such that it eventually vanishes completely. Once returned to low-light conditions, the color re-emerges. Our results suggest that these complex intracellular natural photonic crystals are responsive to environmental conditions, changing their packing structure reversibly, and have the potential to manipulate light for roles beyond visual signaling.","['1 Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Bristol, Bristol BS8 1TH, UK.', '2 Department of Nanophotonics, International Iberian Nanotechnology Laboratory, 4715-330 Braga, Portugal.', '3 School of Biological Sciences, University of Bristol, Life Sciences Building, 24 Tyndall Avenue, Bristol BS8 1TQ, UK.', '4 School of Physics, Henry Herbert Wills Physics Laboratory, University of Bristol, Tyndall Avenue, Bristol BS8 1TL, UK.']","Martin Lopez-Garcia, Nathan Masters, Heath E O'Brien, Joseph Lennon, George Atkinson, Martin J Cryan, Ruth Oulton, Heather M Whitney, ",Science advances,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29651457
96,Temperature Rise under Two-Photon Optogenetic Brain Stimulation,"In recent decades, optogenetics has been transforming neuroscience research, enabling neuroscientists to drive and read neural circuits. The recent development in illumination approaches combined with two-photon (2P) excitation, either sequential or parallel, has opened the route for brain circuit manipulation with single-cell resolution and millisecond temporal precision. Yet, the high excitation power required for multi-target photostimulation, especially under 2P illumination, raises questions about the induced local heating inside samples. Here, we present and experimentally validate a theoretical model that makes it possible to simulate 3D light propagation and heat diffusion in optically scattering samples at high spatial and temporal resolution under the illumination configurations most commonly used to perform 2P optogenetics: single- and multi-spot holographic illumination and spiral laser scanning. By investigating the effects of photostimulation repetition rate, spot spacing, and illumination dependence of heat diffusion, we found conditions that make it possible to design a multi-target 2P optogenetics experiment with minimal sample heating.","['1 Wavefront-Engineering Microscopy Group, Neurophotonics Laboratory, UMR 8250 CNRS, University Paris Descartes, 45 rue des Saints-Pères, 75006 Paris, France.', '2 Holographic Microscopy Group, Neurophotonics Laboratory, UMR 8250 CNRS, University Paris Descartes, 45 rue des Saints-Pères, 75006 Paris, France; Sorbonne Université, CNRS, INSERM, Institut de la Vision, 17 Rue Moreau, 75011 Paris, France.', '3 Wavefront-Engineering Microscopy Group, Neurophotonics Laboratory, UMR 8250 CNRS, University Paris Descartes, 45 rue des Saints-Pères, 75006 Paris, France; Sorbonne Université, CNRS, INSERM, Institut de la Vision, 17 Rue Moreau, 75011 Paris, France.', '4 Holographic Microscopy Group, Neurophotonics Laboratory, UMR 8250 CNRS, University Paris Descartes, 45 rue des Saints-Pères, 75006 Paris, France.', '5 Wavefront-Engineering Microscopy Group, Neurophotonics Laboratory, UMR 8250 CNRS, University Paris Descartes, 45 rue des Saints-Pères, 75006 Paris, France; Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale (Inserm), Paris, France.', '6 Department of Physics of Complex Systems, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel.', '7 Wavefront-Engineering Microscopy Group, Neurophotonics Laboratory, UMR 8250 CNRS, University Paris Descartes, 45 rue des Saints-Pères, 75006 Paris, France.

97,Aberrated surface soliton formation in a nonlinear 1D and 2D photonic crystal,"We discuss a novel type of surface soliton-aberrated surface soliton-appearance in a nonlinear one dimensional photonic crystal and a possibility of this surface soliton formation in two dimensional photonic crystal. An aberrated surface soliton possesses a nonlinear distribution of the wavefront. We show that, in one dimensional photonic crystal, the surface soliton is formed at the photonic crystal boundary with the ambient medium. Essentially, that it occupies several layers at the photonic crystal boundary and penetrates into the ambient medium at a distance also equal to several layers, so that one can infer about light energy localization at the lateral surface of the photonic crystal. In the one dimensional case, the surface soliton is formed from an earlier formed soliton that falls along the photonic crystal layers at an angle which differs slightly from the normal to the photonic crystal face. In the two dimensional case, the soliton can appear if an incident Gaussian beam falls on the photonic crystal face. The influence of laser radiation parameters, optical properties of photonic crystal layers and ambient medium on the one dimensional surface soliton formation is investigated. We also discuss the influence of two dimensional photonic crystal configuration on light energy localization near the photonic crystal surface. It is important that aberrated surface solitons can be created at relatively low laser pulse intensity and for close values of alternating layers dielectric permittivity which allows their experimental observation.","['1 Faculty of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics, Lomonosov Moscow State University, Moscow, Russia.']","Vyacheslav A Trofimov, Tatiana M Lysak, Evgenii M Trykin, ",PloS one,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29558497

99,Modelling of the focal spot intensity distribution and the off-focal spot radiation in kilovoltage x-ray tubes for imaging,"X-ray tubes for medical applications typically generate x-rays by accelerating electrons, emitted from a cathode, with an interelectrode electric field, towards an anode target. X-rays are not emitted from one point, but from an irregularly shaped area on the anode, the focal spot. Focal spot intensity distributions and off-focal radiation negatively affect the imaging spatial resolution and broadens the beam penumbra. In this study, a Monte Carlo simulation model of an x-ray tube was developed to evaluate the spectral and spatial characteristics of off-focal radiation for multiple photon energies. Slit camera measurements were used to determine the horizontal and vertical intensity profiles of the small and the large focal spot of a diagnostic x-ray tube. First, electron beamlet weighting factors were obtained via an iterative optimization method to represent both focal spot sizes. These weighting factors were then used to extract off-focal spot radiation characteristics for the small and large focal spot sizes at 80, 100, and 120 kV. Finally, 120 kV simulations of a steel sphere (d = 4 mm) were performed to investigate image blurring with a point source, the small focal spot, and the large focal spot. The magnitude of off-focal radiation strongly depends on the anode size and the electric field coverage, and only minimally on the tube potential and the primary focal spot size. In conclusion, an x-ray tube Monte Carlo simulation model was developed to simulate focal spot intensity distributions and to evaluate off-focal radiation characteristics at several energies. This model can be further employed to investigate focal spot correction methods and to improve cone-beam CT image quality.","['1 Department of Radiation Oncology (MAASTRO), GROW-School for Oncology and Developmental Biology, Maastricht University Medical Centre, Maastricht, The Netherlands.']","Brent van der Heyden, Gabriel Paiva Fonseca, Mark Podesta, Ivan Messner, Niklas Reisz, Ana Vaniqui, Heinz Deutschmann, Phil Steininger, Frank Verhaegen, ",Physics in medicine and biology,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31835265

In particular, through-focus visual acuity (VA) was measured in four subjects under three longitudinal chromatic aberration (LCA) conditions: natural LCA, compensated LCA and doubled LCA. Ray-tracing simulations using a chromatic eye model were also performed for a better understanding of experimental results. Simulations predicted the optical quality of the retinal images and VA by applying a semi-empirical formula. Experimental and ray tracing results showed a significant agreement in the natural LCA case (R2 = 0.92). Modifying the LCA caused an impairment in the predictability of the results, with decreasing correlations between experiment and simulations (compensated LCA, R2 = 0.84; doubled LCA, R2 = 0.59). VA under modified LCA was systematically overestimated by the model around the best focus position. The results provided useful information on how LCA manipulation affects the depth of focus.

103,Effect of dose-delivery time for flattened and flattening filter-free photon beams based on microdosimetric kinetic model,"The effect of dose-delivery time with flattening filter (FF) and flattening filter-free (FFF) photon beams based on microdosimetric kinetic model (MKM) was investigated in this study. Monte Carlo simulation with the particle and heavy ion transport code system (PHITS) was performed to calculate the dose-mean lineal energy yD (keV/μm) of FF and FFF 6 MV photon beams using the IAEA phase-space files of Varian TrueBeam linear accelerator. Human non-small cell lung cancer NCI-H460 cells were used to determine the MKM parameters under the condition that dose-delivery times with continuous irradiation were 1, 5, 10, 30, and 60 min, and the adsorbed dose was 2, 4, and 8 Gy in this study. In addition, the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of FF and FFF photon beams were calculated for evaluating the effect of dose delivery time. The RBE of FF decreased to 99.8% and 97.5% with 5 and 60 min for 2 Gy in comparison to 99.6% and 95.1% for 8 Gy, respectively. Meanwhile, that of FFF decreased to 99.5% and 94.9% with 5 and 60 min for 2 Gy in comparison to 99.5% and 94.9% for 8 Gy, respectively. Dose-delivery time has an effect on the RBE with photon beams. In other words, the dose-delivery time should be considered during radiation therapy. Furthermore, FFF photon beams were an effective irradiation method compared to FF in dose-delivery time on account of improving clinic throughput.","['1 Hiroshima Heiwa Clinic, High-Precision Radiotherapy Center, Kawaramachi, Naka-ku, Hiroshima-shi, Hiroshima, Japan.', '2 Devision of Radiation Oncology, Niigata University Medical and Dental Hospital, Asahimachi-dori, Chuo-ku, Niigata, Japan.', '3 Radiation Therapy Section, Department of Clinical Support, Hiroshima University Hospital, Kasumi, Minami-ku, Hiroshima-shi, Hiroshima, Japan.', '4 Medical and Dental Sciences Course, Graduate School of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Hiroshima University, Kasumi, Minami-ku, Hiroshima-shi, Hiroshima, Japan.']","Hisashi Nakano, Daisuke Kawahara, Kaoru Ono, Yukio Akagi, Yutaka Hirokawa, ",PloS one,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30462672
104,Impact of new ICRU Report 90 recommendations on calculated correction factors for reference dosimetry,"In 2016 the ICRU published a new report dealing with key data for ionizing radiation dosimetry (ICRU Report 90). New recommendations have been made for the mean excitation energies I for air, graphite and liquid water as well as for the graphite density to use when evaluating the density effect. In addition, the ICRU Report 90 discusses renormalized photoelectric cross sections, but refuses to give a recommendation on the use of renormalization factors. However, the Consultative Committee for Ionizing Radiation recommends to use renormalized photoeffect cross sections. Goal of the present work is to evaluate the impact of these new recommendations on clinical reference dosimetry for high energy photon and electron beams. The beam quality correction factor k Q was calculated by Monte Carlo simulations for compact and parallel plate ionization chambers. In case of photons seven phase space files from clinical accelerators and twelve spectra taken from literature from 4 MV to 24 MV and additionally a 60Co source were applied. As electron source thirteen electron spectra available in literature were used in the range of 4 MeV-21 MeV. The new ICRU recommendations have a small impact on Monte Carlo calculated k Q values for the chosen ionization chambers in the range of 0.1%-0.35% only-the difference increases for higher photon energies. The impact of the ICRU Report 90 recommendations on Monte Carlo calculated stopping power ratios s w,a , perturbation factors p and beam quality correction factors k Q was investigated and confirmed a decrese of s w,a by a fraction of a percent for photon and electron beams. This study indicates that the impact of the new ICRU recommendation is within 0.35%. The determined deviations should be taken into account, when widely published Monte Carlo calculated values are examined.","['1 Institute of Medical Physics and Radiation Protection, University of Applied Sciences Giessen, Giessen, Germany.

105,Reply to comment on 'origins of the changing detector response in small megavoltage photon radiation fields',"Andreo and Benmakhlouf (2017 Phys. Med. Biol. 62 1518-32) have disputed a finding of Scott et al (2012 Phys. Med. Biol. 57 4461-76) that the variation with field-size of the response of small ion chambers and solid-state dosimeters in small megavoltage photon radiation fields can largely be attributed to density. Further evidence for this finding was provided by Fenwick et al (2018 Phys. Med. Biol. 63 125003), but Andreo and Benmakhlouf (2018 Phys. Med. Biol. 63 125003) have now challenged the methodology used in that study. Specifically, Andreo and Benmakhlouf suggest that mass stopping-powers of fictitious materials used in Monte Carlo radiation transport calculations should be adjusted with material density according to the polarization effect, as if the materials were real and created by compressing other real materials. In this reply, we observe that fictitious materials are not real, and therefore their densities, mass stopping-powers and microscopic radiation interaction cross-sections can be freely and independently chosen to provide the clearest answers to the questions being studied. And we note that the key role played by density in small field detector response was further confirmed by our group back in 2013, using fictitious materials in which mass stopping-powers were adjusted with density, as preferred by Andreo and Benmakhlouf, as well as being held fixed, with very similar results being obtained in both circumstances (Underwood et al 2013a Med.

Various optical designs have been proposed to implement multifocality or an extended depth of focus (EDOF). Depending on the optical principle of an implanted lens, the visual performance often is deteriorated by superposition of individual image planes and halos of varying intensity. This experimental study presents a concept to visualize the light fields and especially the halos of mono- and multifocal IOLs using the well known alcoholic beverage ""ouzo"" in order to obtain qualitative data on the imaging characteristics.

107,Technical Note: Influence of entrance window deformation on reference dosimetry measurement in various beam modalities,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      Phantoms for horizontal beam geometry can avoid issues in vertical-beam geometry, such as change in chamber depth due to evaporation, and defining the origin at the water surface. However, their thin entrance windows would deform when these phantoms are filled, which can change the chamber depth, as pointed out by The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) TRS-398. Currently, few reports (Arib et al., J Appl Clin Med Phys. 2006; 7:55-64, and Kinoshita et al., Rep Pract Oncol Radiother. 2018; 23:199-206) are available with practical data on window deformation. Therefore, we investigated the influence of entrance window deformation on chamber depths in water phantoms and the measurements in various beam modalities. Methods:
      
    

    
      To examine widely used phantoms and phantoms with different characteristics, three phantom types were investigated (the number of phantoms investigated appears in parentheses): PTW-type 41023 (2), Qualita-QWP-04 (2), and IBA-WP34 (2). Prior to the investigation, these phantoms were stored for acclimatization in a room for approximately 10 h under the following two conditions: (a) room temperature: 21 ± 2°C; (b) room temperature: 27 ± 2°C. Using a dial indicator, the centers of the windows were monitored every 30 min for 12 h immediately after the phantoms were filled, in a treatment room at the room temperature of 21 ± 2°C. Results:
      
    

    
      Immediately after the phantoms were filled, the window deformation ranged from -0.07 (inward-deformation) to 0.3 mm (outward deformation) among the six phantoms, in comparison with empty phantom windows. For 12 h after the phantoms were filled, the change in the deformation was up to 0.23 mm, but typically less than 0.15 mm. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Reference dosimetry in photon, electron, and proton beams would not be influenced significantly by these window behaviors, whereas the window deformation has a slight impact on those heavy ion beams.","['1 Department of Radiological and Medical Laboratory Sciences, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, 1-1-20, Daiko-Minami, Higashi, Nagoya, 461-8673, Japan.', '2 Radiological Center, University of Fukui Hospital, 23-3, Matsuoka-shimoaizuki, Eiheiji, Fukui, 910-1193, Japan.', '3 Medical Physics Section, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, 4-9-1 Anagawa, Inage, Chiba, 263-8555, Japan.']","Naoki Kinoshita, Ryosuke Kohno, Hiroshi Oguchi, ",Medical physics,2019 Feb,entrance window deformation; horizontal beam geometry; ion chamber depth; water phantom.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30500984

      Intraocular lens (IOL) calculations in patients with keratoconus and other keratoectatic disorders continues to be a challenge for today's cataract surgeon. In this article, we review data published over the past 18 months (June 2018 to January 2020). Recent findings:
      
    

    
      Cataract surgery in keratoconus patients has the potential to greatly improve patients' vision. However, keratoconic eyes are notorious for unpredictable outcomes because of difficulty in obtaining proper preoperative biometry and lack of data and consensus on IOL calculation formulas that can reliable in providing the desired outcome. Recent studies suggest the Barrett II Universal calculation is the most accurate in mild-to-moderate keratoconic eyes. All studies note the level of predictability decreases with the steepness of keratometric readings. Historically, the SRK/T has been shown to provide the most reliable calculations. Summary:
      
    

    
      There is still no consensus on which formula is best for IOL calculation in keratoconic eyes. On the basis of the most recent literature, we recommend using the Barrett II Universal in conjunction with the SRK/T formula for mild-to-moderate eyes.

To exploit their unique properties, mechanistic insights for charge transport events taking place from the molecular to the device scale must be uncovered. Thus, a central contributor to the continued progress in conjugated optoelectronic materials will be the development of advanced characterization tools, particularly those targeted to measuring the charge-transfer processes in heterogeneous, anisotropic, and hierarchically structured materials. This feature article describes the morphological properties that make partially ordered polymers an intriguing materials system to explore connections between chemical identity, solid-phase microstructure, and hierarchical charge transport. To this end, recent directions in materials development and new opportunities for characterization are discussed.","['1 Chemistry Department, University of Utah, 315 S 1400 E, Salt Lake City, UT, 84112, USA.']","Rodrigo Noriega, ",Macromolecular rapid communications,2018 Jul,characterization; charge transport; conjugated polymers; microstructure.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29682841
112,Design of Microscope Optics for the Acquisition of Multiple Wavelength Band Image,"We design combinations of filters that lead to make outputs of multiple wavelength bands simultaneously. These bands are either 1) Infrared, RGB, Ultraviolet-3ranges 2) IR, Red, Green, Blue, UV-5ranges 3) IR+ Red, Green, Blue+UV-3ranges. Each is mostly devised by the arrangement of normal cold mirror, UV cold mirror, Philips(RGB) prism, UV filter and color filter. For the selection 1), UV cold mirror reflects UV and transmit VIS + IR. VIS and IR are sorted by normal cold mirror, which passes IR and reflects VIS. Each sorted light goes to each sensor to capture the images. The sorting of VIS and UV also can be done by UV filter. For the selection 2), have a same process in 1) but make VIS pass Philips(RGB) prism which sorts VIS into R, G, B. For the selection 3), the light passes green color filter first, Green color is only transmitted and the others are reflected. And then reflected light goes through UV cold mirror so that UV and Blue (wavelength <; 500nm) are reflected. And the others(wavelength>550nm, but green color zone was already sorted roughly wavelength>600nm) are transmitted, which is Red and IR. This sorting can be done by another design. After sorting all ranges by the selection 2), we can arrange UV goes a same pass with blue, and IR with red.

113,Effect of Chromoendoscopy Filters on Visualization of KTP Laser-Associated Tissue Changes: A Cadaveric Animal Model,"Standard KTP laser (potassium titanyl phosphate) wavelength-specific protective eyewear often impairs visualization of tissue changes during laser treatment. This sometimes necessitates eyewear removal to evaluate tissue effects, which wastes time and poses safety concerns. The objective was to determine if ""virtual"" or ""electronic"" chromoendoscopy filters, as found on some endoscopy platforms, could alleviate the restricted visualization inherent to protective eyewear. A KTP laser was applied to porcine laryngeal tissue and recorded via video laryngoscopy with 1 optical (Olympus Narrow Band Imaging) and 8 digital (Pentax Medical I-scan) chromoendoscopy filters. Videos were viewed by 11 otolaryngologists wearing protective eyewear. Using a discrete visual analog scale, they rated each filter on its ability to improve visualization,. No filter impaired visualization; 5 of 9 improved visualization. Based on statistical significance, the number of positive responses, and the lack of negative responses, narrow band imaging and the I-scan tone enhancement filter for leukoplakia performed best. These filters could shorten procedure time and improve safety; therefore, further clinical evaluation is warranted.","['1 1 Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University, Augusta, Georgia, USA.', '2 2 Department of Otolaryngology, Naval Medical Center San Diego, San Diego, CA, USA.']","Christopher M Johnson, Mariah B Pate, Gregory N Postma, ",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,2018 Apr,KTP laser; electronic chromoendoscopy; i-scan; in-office surgery; narrow band imaging; protective eyewear; virtual chromoendoscopy.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29336196
114,Line excitation array detection fluorescence microscopy at 0.8 million frames per second,"Three-dimensional, fluorescence imaging methods with ~1 MHz frame rates are needed for high-speed, blur-free flow cytometry and capturing volumetric neuronal activity. The frame rates of current imaging methods are limited to kHz by the photon budget, slow camera readout, and/or slow laser beam scanners. Here, we present line excitation array detection (LEAD) fluorescence microscopy, a high-speed imaging method capable of providing 0.8 million frames per second. The method performs 0.8 MHz line-scanning of an excitation laser beam using a chirped signal-driven longitudinal acousto-optic deflector to create a virtual light-sheet, and images the field-of-view with a linear photomultiplier tube array to generate a 66 × 14 pixel frame each scan cycle. We implement LEAD microscopy as a blur-free flow cytometer for Caenorhabditis elegans moving at 1 m s-1 with 3.5-µm resolution and signal-to-background ratios >200. Signal-to-noise measurements indicate future LEAD fluorescence microscopes can reach higher resolutions and pixels per frame without compromising frame rates.","['1 Department of Biomedical Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin, 107 W Dean Keeton St., Austin, TX, 78712, USA.', '2 Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin, 204 E Dean Keeton St., Austin, TX, 78712, USA.', '3 Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin, 2501 Speedway, Austin, TX, 78712, USA.', '4 Department of Biomedical Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin, 107 W Dean Keeton St., Austin, TX, 78712, USA. ben-yakar@mail.utexas.edu.', '5 Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin, 204 E Dean Keeton St., Austin, TX, 78712, USA. ben-yakar@mail.utexas.edu.', '6 Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin, 2501 Speedway, Austin, TX, 78712, USA. ben-yakar@mail.utexas.edu.']","Chris Martin, Tianqi Li, Evan Hegarty, Peisen Zhao, Sudip Mondal, Adela Ben-Yakar, ",Nature communications,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30374138

      Laboratory study. Methods:
      
    

    
      Fourteen square-edged 20.0 diopter IOLs were analyzed, including 9 hydrophobic IOLs (AF-1, AF-1 iSert, Clareon, EyeCee One Crystal, CT Lucia, Envista, EyeCee One, Vivinex iSert, and RayOne Hydrophobic) and 5 hydrophilic IOLs (Asphira, CT Asphina, Incise, Synthesis, and RayOne Hydrophilic). All the IOLs were scanned following a previously published standardized technique using environmental scanning electron microscopy. The posterior optic edges were scanned at a magnification of ×500 and ×200 to measure the radius of curvature of the posterior optic edges and the optic edge thickness. Results:
      
    

    
      The radius of curvature of the posterior optic edges ranged from 4.6 to 20.6 μm. Except for the Incise IOL (7.7 μm), all hydrophilic IOLs (Synthesis [10.6 μm], Asphira [13.7 μm], RayOne Hydrophilic [14.0 μm], CT Asphina [13.7 μm]) had a radius of curvature greater than 10.0 μm. For the hydrophobic IOLs, the radius of curvature was less than 10.0 μm for the Clareon (7.9 μm), EyeCee One Crystal (4.7 μm), Vivinex iSert (7.6 μm), and CT Lucia (4.6 μm), and greater than 10.0 μm for the Envista (19.7 μm), EyeCee One (13.7 μm), AF-1 iSert (19.7 μm), AF-1 (19.7 μm) and the RayOne Hydrophobic (20.6 μm). The Vivinex iSert (150.5 μm) and the Incise (218.2 μm) were the thinnest IOLs, and the RayOne Hydrophobic (375.8 μm) and RayOne Hydrophilic IOLs (477.1 μm) were the thickest of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic IOLs, respectively. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Commercially marketed square-edged IOLs still differed in the sharpness of the posterior optic edge. More hydrophobic IOLs have rounder edges than those studied 10 years ago. Variations in the edge profile of hydrophobic IOLs were greater compared with the hydrophilic IOLs.","['1 Sussex Eye Hospital, Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust, Brighton, England; Brighton and Sussex Medical School, University of Sussex, Falmer, England.

116,Evolutionary-Optimized Photonic Network Structure in White Beetle Wing Scales,"Most studies of structural color in nature concern periodic arrays, which through the interference of light create color. The ""color"" white however relies on the multiple scattering of light within a randomly structured medium, which randomizes the direction and phase of incident light. Opaque white materials therefore must be much thicker than periodic structures. It is known that flying insects create ""white"" in extremely thin layers. This raises the question, whether evolution has optimized the wing scale morphology for white reflection at a minimum material use. This hypothesis is difficult to prove, since this requires the detailed knowledge of the scattering morphology combined with a suitable theoretical model. Here, a cryoptychographic X-ray tomography method is employed to obtain a full 3D structural dataset of the network morphology within a white beetle wing scale. By digitally manipulating this 3D representation, this study demonstrates that this morphology indeed provides the highest white retroreflection at the minimum use of material, and hence weight for the organism. Changing any of the network parameters (within the parameter space accessible by biological materials) either increases the weight, increases the thickness, or reduces reflectivity, providing clear evidence for the evolutionary optimization of this morphology.","['1 Adolphe Merkle Institute, University of Fribourg, Chemin des Verdiers, 4, CH-1700, Fribourg, Switzerland.', '2 Department of Physics, University of Cambridge, JJ Thompson Avenue, CB3 0HE, Cambridge, UK.', '3 Swiss Light Source, Paul Scherrer Institute, CH-5232, Villigen, Switzerland.', '4 Institute of Structural Physics, Technische Universität Dresden, 01062, Dresden, Germany.', '5 Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Lensfield Road, CB2 1EW, Cambridge, UK.', '6 Department of Chemistry, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, 08544, USA.', '7 Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY, Notkestr. 85, 22607, Hamburg, Germany.', '8 Department of Physics, Universität Hamburg, Luruper Chaussee 149, 22761, Hamburg, Germany.']","Bodo D Wilts, Xiaoyuan Sheng, Mirko Holler, Ana Diaz, Manuel Guizar-Sicairos, Jörg Raabe, Robert Hoppe, Shu-Hao Liu, Richard Langford, Olimpia D Onelli, Duyu Chen, Salvatore Torquato, Ullrich Steiner, Christian G Schroer, Silvia Vignolini, Alessandro Sepe, ","Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",2018 May,X-ray ptychography; arthopods; biophotonic structures; light scattering; nanotomography.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28640543

When fitting spherical and cylindrical lenses, it is interesting to know which properties the respective lenses have. One should also be aware of the optical paths and refraction laws when fitting spectacle lenses and prisms. In addition, when prescribing spectacle lenses, one should consider changes in the distance between corneal apex and spectacle lens and know conversions for the strength of contact lenses.

      To evaluate locoregional control and outcome after mastectomy in patients treated with postmastectomy highly conformal electron radiation therapy (PMERT) with bolus compared with patients treated by highly conformal photon radiation therapy (PMPhRT) without bolus in the adjuvant setting of nonmetastatic breast cancer. Methods and materials:
      
    

    
      We studied women undergoing PMRT without immediate reconstruction for breast cancer before 2012 in 2 sites of our hospital using 2 different techniques. All patients received 50 Gy in 25 fractions. Patients previously treated by neoadjuvant chemotherapy were excluded. Results:
      
    

    
      Among the 807 patients, 583 received PMERT and 224 received PMPhRT. The median follow-up was 64 months. Patients in the PMERT group had a median age of 52.7 years (range, 26-91 years), 6.9% were triple-negative, 16.3% were HER2-positive, and 58.6% had multifocal lesions. Patients in the PMPhRT group had a median age of 56.4 years (28-89), 8.5% were triple negative, 12.9% were HER2-positive, and 55.8% had multifocal lesions. Lymph node involvement was observed in 66% and 72.8% of cases (P = .07) treated with PMERT and PMPhRT, respectively. No significant difference in overall survival was observed between the 2 groups (hazard ratio [HR], 1.2; 95% CI, 0.67-2.13; P = .54). The risk of locoregional recurrence, estimated using the Fine-Gray method, was significantly higher with PMPhRT than with PMERT (subdistribution HR, 3.62; 95% CI, 1.07-12.3; P = .04), corresponding to a 5-year LRR rate of 0.53% (95% CI, 0-1.12%) for PMERT and 2.52% (95% CI, 0.05%-4.6%) for PMPhRT.

122,Operation of photon diagnostic imagers for beam commissioning at the European XFEL,"X-ray photon beam diagnostic imagers are located at 24 positions in the European XFEL beam transport system to characterize the X-ray beam properties, and to give feedback for tuning and optimization of the electron acceleration and orbit, the undulators, and the X-ray optics. One year of commissioning allowed experience to be gained with these imagers, which will be reported here. The sensitive Spontaneous Radiation imager is useful for various investigations in spontaneous radiation mode: for undulator adjustments and for low-signal imaging applications. The high-resolution Free-Electron Laser imager, 10 µm spatial resolution, is extensively used for the monitoring of beam position, spot size and shape, gain curve measurements, and also for beam-intensity monitoring. The wide field-of-view pop-in monitors (up to 200 mm) are regularly used for alignment and tuning of the various X-ray optical components like mirrors, slits and monochromators, and also for on-line beam control of a stable beam position at the instruments. The Exit Slit imager after the soft X-ray monochromator provides spectral information of the beam together with multi-channel plate based single-pulse gating. For particular use cases, these special features of the imagers are described. Some radiation-induced degradation of scintillators took place in this initial commissioning phase, providing useful information for better understanding of damage thresholds. Visible-light radiation in the beam pipe generated by upstream bending magnets caused spurious reflections in the optical system of some of the imagers which can be suppressed by aluminium-coated scintillating screens.","['1 European XFEL, 22869 Schenefeld, Germany.']","Andreas Koch, Johannes Risch, Wolfgang Freund, Theophilos Maltezopoulos, Marc Planas, Jan Grünert, ",Journal of synchrotron radiation,2019,X-ray free-electron lasers; X-ray imaging; beam diagnostics; beam transport systems; scintillators.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31490136
123,Validation of GATE for bone and bone marrow with calculation specific absorbed fraction for photons,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      GATE/GEANT is a Monte Carlo code dedicated to nuclear medicine that allows calculation of the dose to organs (bone and bone marrow) of voxel phantoms. On the other hand, Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD) is a well-developed system for estimation of the dose to human organs. In this study, results obtained from GATE/GEANT using leg of Snyder phantom is compared to published MIRD data. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      For this, the mathematical leg of Snyder phantom was discretized and converted to a digital phantom of 100 × 100 × 200 voxels. The activity was considered uniformly distributed within bone and bone marrow. The GATE/GEANT Monte Carlo code was used to calculate the dose to the bone and bone marrow of the leg phantom from mono-energetic photons of 10, 15, 20, 30, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 keV. The dose was converted into a specific absorbed fraction (SAF) and the results were compared to the corresponding published MIRD data. Results:
      
    

    
      On average, there was a good correlation between the two series of data for self-absorption (r 2 = 0.99) and for cross-irradiation (r 2 = 0.99). However, the GATE/GEANT data were on average 1.01 ± 0.79% higher than the corresponding MIRD data for self-absorption. As for cross-irradiation, the GATE/GEANT data were on average 8.11 ± 7.95% higher than the MIRD data. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      In this study, the SAF values derived from GATE/GEANT and the corresponding MIRD published data were compared. On average, the SAF values derived with GATE/GEANT showed an acceptable correlation and agreement with the MIRD data for the photon energies of 50-1000 keV. For photons of 10-30 keV, there was an only poor agreement between the GATE/GEANT results and MIRD data.","['1 Department of Physics, University of Guilan, Rasht, Iran.', '2 Department of Medical Physics, School of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.']","Seydeh Zahra Ghaseminezhad, Alireza Sadremomtaz, Hossein Rajabi, ",Journal of cancer research and therapeutics,Apr-Jun 2018,Bone; GATE; bone marrow; specific absorbed fraction; validation.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29893333

      The nanoDot response was compared with the ionization chamber measurements for 4-18-MV photons in a plastic water phantom. The response was also calculated by the Monte Carlo method. In addition, the perturbation correction factor, PQ, in the nanoDot cavity was calculated according to the Burlin's cavity theory. The angular dependence of the nanoDot was evaluated using a spherical phantom. Results:
      
    

    
      The calculated and measured nanoDot responses at a 10-cm depth and 10 × 10-cm2 field were in agreement within 1% for 4-18-MV. The response increased by 3% at a 20 × 20-cm2 field for the lower energy of 4 MV; however, it was constant within ±1% for 6-18 MV. The response was in a range from 1.0 to 0.99 for mean photon energy of more than 1.0 MeV but it increased with less than the 1.0 MeV. PQ for the nanoDot cavity was approximately constant at 0.96-0.97 for greater than and equal to 10 MV. The angular dependence decreased by 5% and 3% for 6 and 15 MV, respectively.

Theoretical and Monte Carlo approaches were initially used for designing and optimizing device´s components.

Although traditional imaging techniques are useful in identifying protein interactions and morphology in fixed tissue, they are not able to give insight as to how quickly cells are able to bind and uptake proteins, and once activated how their morphology changes in vivo. In the present study, we ask 2 major questions: 1) what is the time-course of fibroblast activation via toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) interaction and 2) how do these cells behave once activated? Using 2-photon imaging, we have developed a novel technique to assess the ability of LPS-FITC to bind to its cognate receptor, TLR4, expressed on peripheral fibroblasts in the genetic reporter mouse line; FSP1cre; tdTomatolox-stop-lox in vivo.

This summary paper introduces and outlines the main aspects of the CoP. Methods:
      
    

    
      IAEA TRS-483 is a condensation of the wide range of different approaches that have been described in the literature for the reference dosimetry of radiotherapy machines with nominal accelerating potential up to 10 MV that cannot establish the conventional 10 cm × 10 cm reference field, and for the determination of field output factors for relative dosimetry in small static photon fields. The formalism used is based on that developed by Alfonso et al. [Med Phys. 2008;35:5179-5186] for this modality. Results:
      
    

    
      Three introductory sections describe the rationale and context of the CoP, the clinical use of small photon fields, and the physics of small-field dosimetry. In the fourth section, definitions of terms that are specific to the CoP (as compared to previous CoPs for broad-beam reference dosimetry, such as IAEA TRS-398 and AAPM TG-51) are given; this section includes a list of the symbols and equivalences between IAEA and AAPM nomenclature to facilitate the practical implementation of the CoP by end users of IAEA TRS-398 and AAPM TG-51. The fifth section summarizes the equations and procedures that are recommended in the CoP and the sixth section provides an overview of the methods used to derive the data provided in IAEA TRS-483. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      This is the first time an international Code of Practice for the dosimetry of small photon fields based on comprehensive data and correction factors has been published. This joint IAEA/AAPM CoP will ensure consistent reference dosimetry traceable to the international System of Units and enable common and internationally harmonized procedures to be followed by radiotherapy centers worldwide for the dosimetry of small static megavoltage photon fields.","['1 Medical Radiation Science, National Physical Laboratory, Teddington, TW11 0LW, UK.', '2 Department of Medical Physics, EBG MedAustron GmbH, A-2700, Wiener Neustadt, Austria.', '3 Department of Medical Physics and Nuclear Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital, SE-17176, Stockholm, Sweden.', '4 Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, Pittsburgh, PA, 15232, USA.', '5 Medical Physics Unit, McGill University, Montréal, QC, H3A 0G4, Canada.', '6 Dosimetry and Medical Radiation Physics Section, International Atomic Energy Agency, A-1400, Vienna, Austria.']","Hugo Palmans, Pedro Andreo, M Saiful Huq, Jan Seuntjens, Karen E Christaki, Ahmed Meghzifene, ",Medical physics,2018 Nov,Code of Practice; TRS-483; external photon beams; machine-specific reference field; small-field dosimetry.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30247757

129,Structure-based optics of centric diatom frustules: modulation of the in vivo light field for efficient diatom photosynthesis,The optical properties of diatom silicate frustules inspire photonics and nanotechnology research. Whether light interaction with the nano-structure of the frustule also affects diatom photosynthesis has remained unclear due to lack of information on frustule optical properties under more natural conditions. Here we demonstrate that the optical properties of the frustule valves in water affect light harvesting and photosynthesis in live cells of centric diatoms (Coscinodiscus granii). Microscale cellular mapping of photosynthesis around localized spot illumination demonstrated optical coupling of chloroplasts to the valve wall. Photonic structures of the three-layered C. granii valve facilitated light redistribution and efficient photosynthesis in cell regions distant from the directly illuminated area. The different porous structure of the two sides of the valve exhibited photon trapping and forward scattering of blue light enhancing photosynthetic active radiation inside the cell. Photonic structures of diatom frustules thus alter the cellular light field with implications on diatom photobiology.,"['1 Marine Biology Section, Department of Biology, University of Copenhagen, Strandpromenaden 5, 3000, Helsingør, Denmark.', '2 Section\xa0for Plant Glycobiology, Department for Plant and Environmental Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Thorvaldsensvej 40, 1871, Frederiksberg, Denmark.', '3 Departamento de Biologia & CESAM, Universidade de Aveiro, Campus Universitário de Santiago, 3810-193, Aveiro, Portugal.', '4 International Iberian Nanotechnology Laboratory, 4715-330, Braga, Portugal.', '5 Oxyguard International A/S, Farum Gydevej 64, 3520, Farum, Denmark.', '6 Zenzor, Krondrevet 31, 3140, Ålsgårde, Denmark.', '7 Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Lensfield Road, Cambridge, CB2 1EW, UK.', '8 Department of Chemistry, Paderborn University, Warburger Str. 100, 33098, Paderborn, Germany.', '9 Climate Change Cluster, University of Technology Sydney, Ultimo, NSW, 2007, Australia.']","Johannes W Goessling, Yanyan Su, Paulo Cartaxana, Christian Maibohm, Lars F Rickelt, Erik C L Trampe, Sandra L Walby, Daniel Wangpraseurt, Xia Wu, Marianne Ellegaard, Michael Kühl, ",The New phytologist,2018 Jul,biological photonic structures; diatom photosynthesis; frustule optical properties; localized laser illumination; waveguiding.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29672846
130,Flexible Transient Optical Waveguides and Surface-Wave Biosensors Constructed from Monocrystalline Silicon,"Optical technologies offer important capabilities in both biological research and clinical care. Recent interest is in implantable devices that provide intimate optical coupling to biological tissues for a finite time period and then undergo full bioresorption into benign products, thereby serving as temporary implants for diagnosis and/or therapy. The results presented here establish a silicon-based, bioresorbable photonic platform that relies on thin filaments of monocrystalline silicon encapsulated by polymers as flexible, transient optical waveguides for accurate light delivery and sensing at targeted sites in biological systems. Comprehensive studies of the mechanical and optical properties associated with bending and unfurling the waveguides from wafer-scale sources of materials establish general guidelines in fabrication and design. Monitoring biochemical species such as glucose and tracking physiological parameters such as oxygen saturation using near-infrared spectroscopic methods demonstrate modes of utility in biomedicine. These concepts provide versatile capabilities in biomedical diagnosis, therapy, deep-tissue imaging, and surgery, and suggest a broad range of opportunities for silicon photonics in bioresorbable technologies.","['1 Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, 60208, USA.', '2 Center for Bio-Integrated Electronics, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, 60208, USA.', '3 Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, TX, 76019-0072, USA.', '4 Department of Engineering Mechanics, Center for Mechanics and Materials, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China.', '5 Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Frederick Seitz Materials Research Laboratory, Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, 61801, USA.', '6 Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, 61801, USA.', '7 Department of Mechanical Engineering, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, 60208, USA.', '8 Center for Developmental Therapeutics, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, 60208, USA.', '9 Department of Bio and Brain Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, 34141, Republic of Korea.', '10 Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, 60208, USA.', '11 Chemistry Life Processes Institute, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, 60208, USA.', '12 Department of Biomedical Engineering, Department of Neurological Surgery, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Department of Mechanical Engineering, and Department of Chemistry, Simpson Querrey Institute for BioNanotechnology, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, 60208, USA.']","Wubin Bai, Hongjun Yang, Yinji Ma, Hao Chen, Jiho Shin, Yonghao Liu, Quansan Yang, Irawati Kandela, Zhonghe Liu, Seung-Kyun Kang, Chen Wei, Chad R Haney, Anlil Brikha, Xiaochen Ge, Xue Feng, Paul V Braun, Yonggang Huang, Weidong Zhou, John A Rogers, ","Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",2018 Aug,flexible photonics; silicon nanomembrane; spectroscopy; transfer printing; transient photonics.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29944186

132,Accurate Monte Carlo simulation of frequency-domain optical coherence tomography,"Optical coherence tomography (OCT) relies on optical interferometry to provide noninvasive imaging of living tissues. In addition to its 3D imaging capacity for medical diagnosis, its potential use for recovering optical parameters of biological tissues for biological and pathological analyses has also been explored by researchers, as pathological changes in tissue alter the microstructure of the tissue and therefore its optical properties. We aim to develop a new approach to OCT data analysis by estimating optical properties of tissues from OCT scans, which are invisible in the scans. This is an inverse problem. Solving an inverse problem involves a forward modeling step to simulate OCT scans of the tissues with hypothesized optical parameter values and an inverse step to estimate the real optical par1meters values by matching the simulated scans to real scans. In this paper, we present a Monte Carlo (MC)-based approach for simulating the frequency-domain OCT. We incorporated a focusing Gaussian light beam rather than an infinitesimally thin light beam for accurate simulations. A new and more accurate photon detection scheme is also implemented. We compare our MC model to an analytical OCT model based on the extended Huygens-Fresnel principle (EHF) to demonstrate the consistency between the two models. We show that the two models are in good agreement for tissues with high scattering and high anisotropy factors.","['1 School of Computer Science, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, NG8 1BB, UK.']","Yan Wang, Li Bai, ",International journal for numerical methods in biomedical engineering,2019 Apr,Monte Carlo simulation; optical coherent tomography.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30690893

We have used partially coherent soft X-ray synchrotron radiation to obtain a quantitative image of a laterally extended, dried, and unstained fibroblast cell by ptychography. We used data with and without a beam stop that allowed us to measure coherent diffraction with a high-dynamic range of 1.7·106. As a quantitative result, we obtained the refractive index values for two regions of the cell with respect to a reference area. Due to the photon energy in the water window we obtained an extremely high contrast of 53% at 71 nm half-period resolution. The dose applied in our experiment was 9.5·104 Gy and is well below the radiation damage threshold.

134,Calixarene-doped PVC polymeric films as size-selective optical sensors: Monitoring of salicylate in real samples,"Preparation of novel salicylate-selective optical sensors (bulk optodes) was performed and applied successfully for salicylate determination in pharmaceutical formulations, Aspirin® and Aspocid®. t-butyl calix[4]arene ionophore was incorporated in a plasticized poly (vinyl-chloride) membrane containing the chromoionophore ETH5294 (O1) or ETH7075 (O5). The optical response to salicylate was due to size-selective extraction of salicylate from the aqueous solution to the optode bulk through formation of hydrogen bond accompanied by chromoionophore protonation, that resulted in the optical response at 680 or 540 nm for O1 or O5, respectively. Reliable size-selectivity was measured for salicylate over other anions; The calculated selectivity coefficients of O5 optode were found to be: -4.4, -2.0 and - 3.7 for iodide, benzoate and perchlorate, respectively. The hydrogen bonding mechanism and selectivity pattern were ensured and explained by IR and 1H NMR spectroscopy. For the same purpose, a molecular recognition constant of βsal=100.043 was calculated using sandwich membrane method, and its small value ensured that hydrogen bonding interaction is responsible for the optode response. The detection limits of O1 and O5 in salicylate buffered solutions were 9.0 × 10-5 and 8.9 × 10-5 M with response times of 5 and 3 min, respectively, and with very good reversibility. The practical utility of the developed sensors was ensured by salicylate determination in Aspirin® and Aspocid®. Beyond the observed analytical performance, the present work aims not only to effectively apply Calixarene without derivatization, but also to estimate the strength of the size-dependent hydrogen bonding and comprehensively study the interaction mechanism.","['1 Chemistry Department, Faculty of Science, Cairo University, Gamma street, Giza 12613, Egypt.

This artificial neuromast consists of optical fibres inscribed with Bragg gratings supporting a fluid force recipient sphere. Its dynamic response is modelled based on the Stokes solution for unsteady flow around a sphere and found to agree with experimental results. Tuneable mechanical resonance is predicted, allowing a deconvolution scheme to accurately retrieve fluid flow speed and direction from sensor readings. The optical artificial neuromast achieves a low frequency threshold flow sensing of 5 mm s-1 and 5 μm s-1 at resonance, with a typical linear dynamic range of 38 dB at 100 Hz sampling. Furthermore, the optical artificial neuromast is shown to determine flow direction within a few degrees.","['1 Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Engineering, University of Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands.']","Ben J Wolf, Jonathan A S Morton, William N MacPherson, Sietse M van Netten, ",Bioinspiration & biomimetics,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29334081

137,TG-51 reference dosimetry for the Halcyon™: A clinical experience,"Halcyon™ is a single-energy (6 MV-FFF), bore-enclosed linear accelerator. Patient setup is performed by first aligning to external lasers mounted to the front of the bore, and then loading to isocenter through pre-defined couch shifts. There is no light field, optical distance indicator or front pointer mechanism, so positioning is verified through MV imaging with kV imaging scheduled to become available in the future. TG-51 reference dosimetry was successfully performed for Halcyon™ in this imaging-based setup paradigm. The beam quality conversion factor, kQ , was determined by measuring %dd(10)x three ways: (a) using a Farmer chamber with lead filtering, (b) using a Farmer chamber without lead filtering, and (c) using a PinPoint chamber without lead filtering. Values of kQ were determined to be 0.995, 0.996, and 0.996 by each measurement technique, respectively. Halcyon™'s 6 MV-FFF beam was found to be broader than other FFF beams produced by Varian accelerators, and profile measurements at dmax showed the beam to vary less than 0.5% over the dimensions of our Farmer chamber's active volume. Reference dosimetry can be performed for the Halcyon™ accelerator simply, without specialized equipment or lead filtering with minimal dosimetric impact. This simplicity will prove advantageous in clinics with limited resources or physics support.","['1 Department of Radiation Medicine and Applied Sciences, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.']","Samantha A M Lloyd, Tze Yee Lim, Xenia Fave, Everardo Flores-Martinez, Todd F Atwood, Vitali Moiseenko, ",Journal of applied clinical medical physics,2018 Jul,Halcyon; reference dosimetry.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29785729
138,DEPTH DISTRIBUTIONS OF RBE-WEIGHTED DOSE and PHOTON-ISOEFFECTIVE DOSE FOR BORON NEUTRON CAPTURE THERAPY,"Two types of dose were proposed for use in the treatment planning of boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) for expressing its high relative biological effectiveness (RBE). On one hand, the RBE-weighted dose is the sum of the absorbed doses weighted by fixed RBE for each dose component of BNCT. On the other hand, photon-isoeffective dose is the photon dose to give the same biological effect calculated considering the dose dependence of RBE and the synergetic effect between different types of radiation. In this study, the depth distributions of the two types of dose in a phantom placed at an accelerator-based BNCT field were calculated using Particle and Heavy Ion Transport code System, PHITS, coupled with an extended stochastic microdosimetric kinetic model. Compared with the corresponding RBE-weighted dose, the calculated photon-isoeffective dose was larger at lower absorbed dose and was smaller at higher absorbed dose, primarily due to the consideration of the dose dependence of RBE. In addition, our calculation revealed that the large variance of the intercellular 10B concentration greatly reduces the photon-isoeffective doses. These results suggest that the considerations of the dose dependence of RBE as well as the intercellular heterogeneity in 10B distribution are indispensable for the precise estimate of the biological effect of BNCT.","['1 Nuclear Science and Engineering Center Center, Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA), Shirakata 2-4, Tokai, Ibaraki, Japan.', '2 Institute for Integrated Radiation and Nuclear Science, Kyoto University, 2-1010 Asashiro-nishi, Kumatori, Sennan, Osaka, Japan.', '3 Proton Medical Research Center, University of Tsukuba, 2-1-1 Amakubo, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.', '4 Nuclear Technology Research Laboratory, Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry (CRIEPI), 2-11-1 Iwado-kita, Komae, Tokyo, Japan.']","Tatsuhiko Sato, Shin-Ichiro Masunaga, Hiroaki Kumada, Nobuyuki Hamada, ",Radiation protection dosimetry,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30535354
139,Optical Clearing in the Kidney Reveals Potassium-Mediated Tubule Remodeling,"Distal nephron remodeling contributes to the pathophysiology of many clinically relevant scenarios, including diuretic resistance and certain Mendelian disorders of blood pressure. However, constitutive genetic disruptions are likely to have substantial developmental effects in this segment, and whether tubule remodeling upon physiological stimuli is a normal homeostatic mechanism is not known. Since the distal nephron acts as a potassium sensor, we assessed proliferation and tubule length in three dimensions upon dietary or inducible genetic manipulation by using optical clearing of adult mouse kidneys, whole-mount immunolabeling, and advanced light microscopy. We show that dietary potassium restriction leads promptly to proliferation of various nephron segments, including the distal convoluted tubule, whereas disruption of the potassium sensor Kir4.1 causes atrophy, despite ambient hypokalemia. These results provide proof that kidney tubules adapt rapidly to diet and indicate the power of clearing approaches to assess cell number and tubule length in healthy and diseased kidney.","['1 Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239, USA; Division of Nephrology and Clinical Immunology, University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Aachen 52074, Germany.

This effect of Ultraviolet (UV) light illumination was confirmed further in a functional scratch assay, and shown to be more effective than that of a specific EGFR-signaling inhibitor.

In the past few years, our understanding of bacterial cell functions has been enhanced substantially by powerful single-molecule imaging techniques. Using single fluorescent molecules as a means of breaking the optical microscopy limit, we can now reach resolutions of ∼20 nm inside single living cells, a spatial domain previously accessible only by electron microscopy. One can follow a single bacterial protein complex as it performs its functions and directly observe intricate cellular structures as they move and reorganize during the cell cycle. This toolbox enables the use of in vivo quantitative biology by counting molecules, characterizing their intracellular location and mobility, and identifying functionally distinct molecular distributions. Crucially, this can all be achieved while imaging large populations of cells, thus offering detailed views of the heterogeneity in bacterial communities.

Current methods rely on external imaging techniques or implantable sensors, without the ability to provide continuous information over clinically relevant timescales, and/or with requirements in surgical procedures with associated costs and risks.

As an example application, we show that the devices can be used for the continuous monitoring of cerebral temperature, oxygenation and neural activity in freely moving mice. These types of devices should prove useful in fundamental studies of disease pathology, in neuroscience research, in surgical procedures and in monitoring of recovery from injury or illness.","['1 Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA.', '2 Center for Bio-Integrated Electronics, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA.', '3 Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA.', '4 School of Materials Science and Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.', '5 Center for Developmental Therapeutics, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA.', '6 Chemistry Life Processes Institute, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA.', '7 Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, TX, USA.', '8 State Key Laboratory of Metal Matrix Composites, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', '9 Department of Biomedical Engineering, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA.', '10 Center For Advanced Molecular Imaging, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA.', '11 Department of Mechanical Engineering, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA.', '12 Department of Chemistry, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA.', '13 Department of Chemistry, Key Laboratory of Bioorganic Phosphorus Chemistry & Chemical Biology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.', '14 Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.', '15 Northwestern Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA.', '16 Biological Imaging Facility, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA.', '17 Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA. jrogers@northwestern.edu.', '18 Center for Bio-Integrated Electronics, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA. jrogers@northwestern.edu.', '19 Department of Biomedical Engineering, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA. jrogers@northwestern.edu.', '20 Department of Mechanical Engineering, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA. jrogers@northwestern.edu.', '21 Department of Chemistry, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA. jrogers@northwestern.edu.', '22 Department of Neurological Surgery, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA. jrogers@northwestern.edu.', '23 Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA. jrogers@northwestern.edu.', '24 Simpson Querrey Institute for BioNanotechnology, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA. jrogers@northwestern.edu.']","Wubin Bai, Jiho Shin, Ruxing Fu, Irawati Kandela, Di Lu, Xiaoyue Ni, Yoonseok Park, Zhonghe Liu, Tao Hang, Di Wu, Yonghao Liu, Chad R Haney, Iwona Stepien, Quansan Yang, Jie Zhao, Khizar Rehan Nandoliya, Hao Zhang, Xing Sheng, Lan Yin, Keith MacRenaris, Anlil Brikha, Fraser Aird, Maryam Pezhouh, Jessica Hornick, Weidong Zhou, John A Rogers, ",Nature biomedical engineering,2019 Aug,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31391594

Direct mapping of the imaging trajectory shows that the Airy beam extends the axial imaging range around six times longer than a traditional Gaussian beam does along the propagation direction, while maintaining a comparable lateral width. Benefiting from its non-diffracting nature, the TPM with Airy beam illumination is able not only to capture a volumetric image within a single frame, but also to acquire image structures behind a strongly scattered medium. The volumetric specimen is mapped layer by layer under Gaussian mode, while the three-dimensional structure is projected to a single two-dimensional image under Airy mode, leading to a significantly increased acquisition speed. The performance of the TPM is evaluated employing a phantom of agarose gel imbedding fluorescent beads as well as a mouse brain slice.

145,Large Aberration Correction by Magnetic Fluid Deformable Mirror with Model-Based Wavefront Sensorless Control Algorithm,"Magnetic fluid is a stable colloidal suspension of nano-sized, single-domain ferri/ferromagnetic particles dispersed in a liquid carrier. The liquid can be magnetized by the ferromagnetic particles aligned with the external magnetic field, which can be used as a wavefront corrector to correct the large aberrations up to more than 100 µm in adaptive optics (AO) systems. Since the measuring range of the wavefront sensor is normally small, the application of the magnetic fluid deformable mirror (MFDM) is limited with the WFS based AO system. In this paper, based on the MFDM model and the relationship between the second moment (SM) of the aberration gradients and the far-field intensity distribution, a model-based wavefront sensorless (WFSless) control algorithm is proposed for the MFDM. The correction performance of MFDM using the model-based control algorithm is evaluated in a WFSless AO system setup with a prototype MFDM, where a laser beam with unknown aberrations is supposed to produce a focused spot on the CCD. Experimental results show that the MFDM can be used to effectively compensate for unknown aberrations in the imaging system with the proposed model-based control algorithm.","['1 Department of Precision Mechanical Engineering, Shanghai University, Shanghai 200444, China.', '2 Dunlap Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 3H4, Canada.', '3 Department of Precision Mechanical Engineering, Shanghai University, Shanghai 200444, China. zhizhengwu@shu.edu.cn.']","Xiang Wei, Yuanyuan Wang, Zhan Cao, Dziki Mbemba, Azhar Iqbal, Zhizheng Wu, ",International journal of molecular sciences,2019,adaptive optics; deformable mirror; magnetic fluid; wavefront sensorless.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31357727
146,Tungsten Oxide Photonic Crystals as Optical Transducer for Gas Sensing,"Some metal oxide semiconductors, such as tungsten trioxide or tin dioxide, are well-known as resistive transducers for gas sensing and offer high sensitivities down to the part per billion level. Electrical signal read-out, however, limits the information obtained on the electronic properties of metal oxides to a certain frequency range and its application because of the required electrical contacts. Therefore, a novel approach for building an optical transducer for gas reactions utilizing metal oxide photonic crystals is presented here. By the rational design of the structure and composition it is possible to synthesize a functional material which allows one to obtain insight into its electronic properties in the optical frequency range with simple experimental measures. The concept is demonstrated by tungsten trioxide inverse opal structure as optical transducer material for hydrogen sensing. The sensing behavior is analyzed in a temperature range from room temperature to 500 °C and in a wide hydrogen concentration range (3000 ppm to 10%). The sensing mechanism is mainly the refractive index change resulting from hydrogen intercalation in tungsten trioxide, but the back reaction has also impact on the optical properties of this system. Detailed chemical reaction studies provide suggestions for specific sensing conditions.","['1 Paderborn University , Warburger Straße 100, 33098 Paderborn, Germany.']","Sabrina Amrehn, Xia Wu, Thorsten Wagner, ",ACS sensors,2018,hydrogen sensing; inverse opals; optical sensors; photonic crystals; tungsten oxide.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29256240
147,Condensing-enriched magnetic photonic barcodes on superhydrophobic surface for ultrasensitive multiple detection,"The ultrasensitive detection of multiple nucleic acids has great significance in a broad range of medical fields since nucleic acid samples are usually of small volumes and highly diluted. Herein, we present a novel magnetic photonic crystal (PhC) barcode-integrated condensing-enriched superhydrophobic platform for the ultrasensitive multiple miRNA detection. Droplets containing targets could suck the hydrogel PhC barcodes without losing their targets due to the difference in wettability between the hydrophilic PhC barcodes and hydrophobic substrate. During the evaporation of water from the droplet microreactors, these targets could be effectively enriched in the barcodes for achieving higher sensitivities. As the encoding signals of the PhC barcodes are the characteristic reflection peaks generated by their ordered physical nanostructures, the barcodes are stable and free from any fluorescent background and photobleaching; thus, they are accurate for distinguishing different targets. In addition, with the integration of magnetic nanoparticles into the hydrogel PhC barcodes, they could be imparted with the features of immobilization during change of medium and flexible movement for controlling the reaction, both of which could facilitate the detection processes. Based on this platform, we have demonstrated that the detection limit of multiple miRNAs is improved by about three orders. Thus, our platform is an ideal alternative for the ultrasensitive simultaneous multiplex analysis in medical fields.","['1 State Key Laboratory of Bioelectronics, School of Biological Science and Medical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing 210096, China. yjzhao@seu.edu.cn.']","Lijun Cai, Feika Bian, Lingyu Sun, Huan Wang, Yuanjin Zhao, ",Lab on a chip,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31032503
148,Technical Note: Increased photon starvation artifacts at low helical pitch in ultra-low-dose CT,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      The aim of this study was to demonstrate that a low helical pitch causes increased photon starvation artifacts at ultra-low-dose CT. Methods:
      
    

    
      A cylindrical water phantom with a diameter of 30 cm was scanned on two different generation CT scanners: a 64-slice scanner (Sensation 64, Siemens Healthcare) and a 192-slice scanner (Somatom Force, Siemens Healthcare) at multiple effective mAs levels (mAs/pitch = 200, 100, 50, 25, and 12). The corresponding CTDIvol values were 4.1, 2.0, 1.0, 0.5 mGy, on the 64-slice scanner and 3.8, 1.9, 1.0, 0.5 mGy on the 192-slice scanner, for the selected effective mAs values. For each dose setting, the scan was repeated at four helical pitches: 1.2, 0.9, 0.6, and the lowest achievable pitch on each scanner. The tube current was automatically adjusted by the scanner so that the effective mAs, and thus CTDIvol , were kept the same for different pitches. All CT data sets were reconstructed with a slice thickness of 3mm and a medium smooth kernel. Images acquired at the same dose level but different helical pitches were visually inspected to assess photon starvation artifacts and noise levels. Results:
      
    

    
      At the same radiation dose, image noise increased with the decreasing helical pitch. The increase was more severe on the old-generation 64-slice scanner. Photon starvation artifacts were evident at 200 effective mAs on the 64-slice scanner at 80 kV. On the 192-slice scanner there was no visible photon starvation artifacts at both 200 and 50 effective mAs (CTDIvol = 4.1 mGy and 1.0 mGy, respectively); nor was there a visible impact from the lower helical pitch. Only when the dose was lowered to be extremely low (~0.26 mGy, achievable at 70 kV), did photon starvation artifacts become evident. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      A low helical pitch may increase image noise and photon starvation artifacts compared to a higher pitch for the same dose level, particularly at ultra-low dose CT.","['1 Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.']","Jacinta E Browne, Michael R Bruesewitz, Thomas J Vrieze, Cynthia H McCollough, Lifeng Yu, ",Medical physics,2019 Dec,CT protocol optimization; artifacts; image quality; ultra-low dose CT.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31580485

The two-photon patterning of microparticles with predesigned nucleic acid structures of different sizes (700 nm to 2.8 μm) and shapes (circles, rings, triangles, and squares) are demonstrated. In addition, complex patterned domains consisting of two different asymmetric nucleic acid domains are fabricated by the controlled Z-positioning of the microparticles in respect to the two-photon irradiation sources. In addition, the two-photon lithographic patterning of the photocleavable DNA coating allows the generation of functional nucleic acid domains for the photostimulated activation of the catalytic hybridization assembly (CHA) of branched nucleic acid structures on single microparticles.","['1 Engineering Research Center of Nano-Geomaterials of Ministry of Education, Faculty of Materials Science and Chemistry , China University of Geosciences , Wuhan 430074 , China.', '2 Hubei Key Laboratory of Bioinorganic Chemistry & Materia Medica, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering , Huazhong University of Science and Technology , Wuhan 430074 , China.', '3 Institute of Chemistry, Center for Nanoscience and Nanotechnology , The Hebrew University of Jerusalem , Jerusalem 91904 , Israel.']","Fujian Huang, Juan Zhang, Tao Li, Ruilin Duan, Fan Xia, Itamar Willner, ",Nano letters,2019,Photoprotective group; asymmetric pattern; nitrobenzyl phosphate; nucleic acid; photocleavage; structure.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30585496

A significant two-photon action cross-section, good selectivity for biothiols, low cytotoxicity, and insensitivity to pH over the biologically relevant pH range allowed the direct visualization of mercapto biomolecules at different levels between normal/drug-treated live cells, as well as in Drosophila brain tissues/zebrafish based on the use of two-photon fluorescence microscopy.","['1 Key Laboratory of Flexible Electronics (KLOFE) & Institute of Advanced Materials (IAM), Jiangsu National Synergetic Innovation Center for Advanced Materials (SICAM), Nanjing Tech University (NanjingTech), 30 South Puzhu Road, Nanjing, 211816, P.

A physical parameter based on how cells adhere with one another and regulate their shapes can continuously tune the photonic bandgap size as well as the bulk mechanical properties of the material. The material can be tuned to go through a solid-fluid phase transition characterized by a vanishing shear modulus. Remarkably, the photonic bandgap persists in the fluid phase, giving rise to a photonic fluid that is robust to flow and rearrangements. Experimentally this design should lead to the engineering of self-assembled nonrigid photonic structures with photonic bandgaps that can be controlled in real time via mechanical and thermal tuning.","['1 Department of Physics, Northeastern University, Boston, MA 02115.', '2 Department of Physics, Northeastern University, Boston, MA 02115 d.bi@northeastern.edu.']","Xinzhi Li, Amit Das, Dapeng Bi, ",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2018,bioinspired materials; cells; metamaterials; photonic materials; tissue mechanics.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29891685
153,Simulation of photon-counting detectors for conversion of dual-energy-subtracted computed tomography number to electron density,"For accurate tissue-inhomogeneity correction in radiotherapy treatment planning, the author previously proposed a conversion of the energy-subtracted computed tomography (CT) number to electron density (ΔHU-ρe conversion). The purpose of the present study was to provide a method for investigating the accuracy of a photon-counting detector (PCD) used in the ΔHU-ρe conversion by performing dual-energy CT image simulations of a PCD system with two energy bins. To optimize the tube voltage and threshold energy, the image noise and errors in ρe calibration were evaluated using three types of virtual phantoms: a 35-cm-diameter pure water phantom, 33-cm-diameter solid water surrogate phantom equipped with 16 inserts, and another solid water surrogate phantom with a 25-cm diameter. The third phantom was used to investigate the effect of the object's size on the ρe-calibration accuracy of PCDs. Two different scenarios for the PCD energy response were considered, corresponding to the ideal and realistic cases. In addition, a simple correction method for improving the spectral separation of the dual energies in a realistic PCD was proposed to compensate for its performance loss. In the realistic PCD case, there exists a trade-off between the image noise and ρe-calibration errors. Furthermore, the weakest image noise was nearly twice that for the ideal case, and the ρe-calibration error did not reach practical levels for any threshold energy. Nevertheless, the proposed correction method is likely to decrease the ρe-calibration errors of a realistic PCD to the level of the ideal case, yielding more accurate ρe values that are less affected by object size variation.","['1 Department of Radiological Technology, School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Niigata University, Niigata, 951-8518, Japan. masaito@clg.niigata-u.ac.jp.']","Masatoshi Saito, ",Radiological physics and technology,2019 Mar,Dual-energy CT; Electron density; Energy-selective CT; Photon-counting detector.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30628027
154,Adaptive optics microspectrometer for cross-correlation measurement of microfluidic flows,"Mapping flows in vivo is essential for the investigation of cardiovascular pathologies in animal models. The limitation of optical-based methods, such as space-time cross correlation, is the scattering of light by the connective and fat components and the direct wave front distortion by large inhomogeneities in the tissue. Nonlinear excitation of the sample fluorescence helps us by reducing light scattering in excitation. However, there is still a limitation on the signal-background due to the wave front distortion. We develop a diffractive optical microscope based on a single spatial light modulator (SLM) with no movable parts. We combine the correction of wave front distortions to the cross-correlation analysis of the flow dynamics. We use the SLM to shine arbitrary patterns of spots on the sample, to correct their optical aberrations, to shift the aberration corrected spot array on the sample for the collection of fluorescence images, and to measure flow velocities from the cross-correlation functions computed between couples of spots. The setup and the algorithms are tested on various microfluidic devices. By applying the adaptive optics correction algorithm, it is possible to increase up to 5 times the signal-to-background ratio and to reduce approximately of the same ratio the uncertainty of the flow speed measurement. By working on grids of spots, we can correct different aberrations in different portions of the field of view, a feature that allows for anisoplanatic aberrations correction. Finally, being more efficient in the excitation, we increase the accuracy of the speed measurement by employing a larger number of spots in the grid despite the fact that the two-photon excitation efficiency scales as the fourth power of this number: we achieve a twofold decrease of the uncertainty and a threefold increase of the accuracy in the evaluation of the flow speed.","['1 University of Milano-Bicocca, Department of Physics, Milan, Italy.', '2 University of Milano-Bicocca, Nanomedicine Center, Milan, Italy.', '3 Institute of Applied Sciences and Intelligent Systems, National Research Council of Italy, Pozzuoli, Italy.']","Maddalena Collini, Fabrizio Radaelli, Laura Sironi, Nicolo G Ceffa, Laura D'Alfonso, Margaux Bouzin, Giuseppe Chirico, ",Journal of biomedical optics,2019 Feb,adaptive optics; cross-correlation spectroscopy; flow mapping; microfluidics.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30816029
155,Moldable biomimetic nanoscale optoelectronic platforms for simultaneous enhancement in optical absorption and charge transport,"Nano-scale patterns such as those found on the exterior surface of the eyes of certain nocturnal insects have far-reaching implications in terms of optoelectronic device design. The advantage of using these patterns for optoelectronic enhancement in photovoltaic light harvesting has been less explored due to the lack of suitable engineered materials to easily fabricate such nanostructures. Here, an attempt is made to realize these complex patterns using a self-assembly based molding process on hitherto unexplored robust structural epoxies with excellent repeatability and scalability to a larger area. The incorporation of these patterns in the substrate shows nearly a 50% broadband drop in the specular reflectance of the nanostructured substrate. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that by tweaking the bio-inspired patterns on the interior side of a light harvesting device, it is possible to obtain a broadband improvement in the external quantum efficiency in the spectral window between 350 and 650 nm leading to a significant improvement of up to 49% in the photocurrent density in the structured devices. From our experiment and simulations, it is observed that this enhancement stems from a combination of two effects: first, a broadband drop in the specular reflectance exceeding 70%, arising from trapped surface plasmon-polariton modes, and second, an improved charge separation in the structured device arising due to perturbed built-in electric fields. Furthermore, the simulations which take into account the interfacial nano-scale morphology show that for absorbers with low carrier mobilities, a significant improvement in the photocurrent and in the fill factor is simultaneously possible. Overall, this work demonstrates a combination of tweaked bio-mimetic design and the use of unconventional robust structural materials as nanostructured optoelectronic substrates. This effort can bridge the gap between naturally evolved designs and practical optoelectronics to enhance the performance.","['1 Center for Nano Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India560012. onegroupb203@gmail.com.']","Jagdish A K, Kavita Garg, Praveen C Ramamurthy, Debiprosad Roy Mahapatra, Gopalkrishna Hegde, ",Nanoscale,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29411826
156,Neutron dose and its measurement in proton therapy-current State of Knowledge,"Proton therapy has shown dosimetric advantages over conventional radiation therapy using photons. Although the integral dose for patients treated with proton therapy is low, concerns were raised about late effects like secondary cancer caused by dose depositions far away from the treated area. This is especially true for neutrons and therefore the stray dose contribution from neutrons in proton therapy is still being investigated. The higher biological effectiveness of neutrons compared to photons is the main cause of these concerns. The gold-standard in neutron dosimetry is measurements, but performing neutron measurements is challenging. Different approaches have been taken to overcome these difficulties, for instance with newly developed neutron detectors. Monte Carlo simulations is another common technique to assess the dose from secondary neutrons. Measurements and simulations are used to develop analytical models for fast neutron dose estimations. This article tries to summarize the developments in the different aspects of neutron dose in proton therapy since 2017. In general, low neutron doses have been reported, especially in active proton therapy. Although the published biological effectiveness of neutrons relative to photons regarding cancer induction is higher, it is unlikely that the neutron dose has a large impact on the second cancer risk of proton therapy patients.","['1 Institute of Physics, Science Faculty, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', '2 Radiotherapy Hirslanden, Medical Physics, Zurich, Switzerland.']","Roger Antoine Hälg, Uwe Schneider, ",The British journal of radiology,2020 Mar,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31868525

We observed the enhancement of vibrational modes of DNA in the PC in comparison with free DNA of about tenfold and the absence of vibrational modes in DNA bases in a region of 1450-1700 cm-1. The observed features in the RS spectra of DNA are explained by the impact of confined interglobular volume and strong localization of the electromagnetic field.

      The purpose of this retrospective analysis is to analyze clinical outcome, visual acuity and enucleation rates after linear accelerator-based stereotactic fractionated photon radiotherapy for primary uveal melanoma. Methods:
      
    

    
      Twenty-four patients with primary uveal melanoma treated at the Department of Radiation and Oncology of the University Hospital Heidelberg between 1991 and 2015 were analyzed regarding survival and treatment-related toxicity including eye- and sight-preservation. Results:
      
    

    
      Photon radiotherapy (RT) offered good overall local control rates with a local progression-free survival (LPFS) of 82% after 5 years and a median LPFS of 5.5 years at a median follow-up time of 5.2 years. Gender had a significant impact on LPFS yielding a mean LPFS of 8.1 years for women and 8.7 years for men (p = 0.04). Of all local progressions, 80% occurred within the first 5 years after RT. In one case, enucleation as final therapy option was necessary. Enucleation-free survival (EFS) was related to the radiotherapy dose (p < 0.0001). Thus, higher prescribed doses led to a significantly higher enucleation rate. T-stage had no significant impact on EFS, but affected the enucleation rate (p = 0.01). The overall survival (OS) rate was 100% after 2 years and 70% after 5 years with a median OS of 5.75 years. Age (p = 0.046), T stage (p = 0.019), local control rate (p = 0.041) and the time between diagnosis and the first radiation session (p = 0.01) had a significant effect on OS. Applied biologically effective dose (BED) did not significantly influence OS or PFS. A 2-year sight preservation rate of 75% could be achieved. In all patients, irradiation could be applied safely without any interruptions due to side effects. Six significant late toxicities with consequential blindness could be observed, making a secondary enucleation necessary in four patients. An impairment of visual acuity due to chronic optic nerve atrophy was identified in five patients within 2 years after treatment. Conclusions:

However, it has been challenging to satisfy the essential features without making sacrifices in the resolution, frame rate, and eye box. Here, we present a tomographic near-eye display that supports a wide depth of field, quasi-continuous accommodation, omni-directional motion parallax, preserved resolution, full frame, and moderate field of view within a sufficient eye box. The tomographic display consists of focus-tunable optics, a display panel, and a fast spatially adjustable backlight. The synchronization of the focus-tunable optics and the backlight enables the display panel to express the depth information.

162,Theoretical investigation of the count rate capabilities of in-pixel amplifiers for photon counting arrays based on polycrystalline silicon TFTs,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      Photon counting arrays (PCAs), capable of measuring the spectral information of individual x-ray photons and recording that information digitally, provide a number of advantages compared to conventional, energy-integrating active matrix flat-panel imagers - such as reducing the undesirable effects of electronic readout noise and Swank noise. While contemporary PCAs are based on crystalline silicon, our group has been examining the use of polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si, a semiconductor material better-suited for the manufacture of large-area devices) for such arrays. In this study, a theoretical investigation of the front-end amplifiers of array pixels incorporating photon counting circuits is described - building upon circuit simulation techniques developed in a previous study. Results for amplifier circuit designs corresponding to prototype PCAs currently under development, as well as for hypothetical circuit designs identified in the study, are reported. In the simulations, performance metrics (such as signal gain, linearity of signal response, and energy resolution) as well as various measures of count rate are determined. Methods:
      
    

    
      The simulations employed various input energy distributions (i.e., a 72 kVp spectrum as well as monoenergetic x rays) in order to determine circuit performance. To make the results representative of the properties of poly-Si, the simulations incorporated transistor characteristics that were empirically obtained from test devices. Optimal operating conditions for the circuits were determined by applying criteria to the performance metrics and identifying which conditions minimized settling time. Once the optimal operating conditions were identified, trains of input pulses simulating x-ray flux were used to determine two measures of count rate corresponding to dead time losses of 10% and 30% (referred to as CR10 and CR30 , respectively). Results:
      
    

    
      The best-performing prototype amplifier design (implemented at a pixel pitch of 1 mm) exhibited CR10 and CR30 values (expressed in counts per second per pixel) of 8.4 and 21.6 kcps/pixel, respectively. A hypothetical amplifier design was derived by modifying transistor, resistor, and capacitor elements of the prototype amplifier designs. This hypothetical design (implemented at a pitch of 1 mm) exhibited CR10 and CR30 values of 154 and 381 kcps/pixel, respectively. When implemented at a pitch of 0.25 mm, the performance of that design increased to 210 and 491 kcps/pixel, respectively (corresponding to counts per second per unit area of 3.4 and 7.9 Mcps/mm2 ). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The simulation methodology described in this paper represents a useful tool for identifying promising designs for the amplifier component of photon counting arrays, as well as evaluating the analog signal and noise performance of those designs. The results obtained from the current study support the hypothesis that large-area, photon counting arrays based on poly-Si transistors can provide clinically useful count rates. Encouraged by these early results, further development of the methodology to assist in the identification and evaluation of even more promising designs, along with development and empirical characterization of prototype designs, is planned.","['1 Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA.']","Albert K Liang, Martin Koniczek, Larry E Antonuk, Youcef El-Mohri, Qihua Zhao, ",Medical physics,2018 Oct,circuit simulations; count rate; medical x-ray imaging; photon counting arrays; polycrystalline silicon thin-film transistors.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30106180
163,Gold Nanoparticles in Radiotherapy and Recent Progress in Nanobrachytherapy,"Over the last few decades, gold nanoparticles (GNPs) have emerged as ""radiosensitizers"" in oncology. Radiosensitizers are additives that can enhance the effects of radiation on biological tissues treated with radiotherapy. The interaction of photons with GNPs leads to the emission of low-energy and short-range secondary electrons, which in turn increase the dose deposited in tissues. In this context, GNPs are the subject of intensive theoretical and experimental studies aiming at optimizing the parameters leading to greater dose enhancement and highest therapeutic effect. This review describes the main mechanisms occurring between photons and GNPs that lead to dose enhancement. The outcome of theoretical simulations of the interactions between GNPs and photons is presented. Finally, the findings of the most recent in vivo studies about interactions between GNPs and photon sources (e.g., external beams, brachytherapy sources, and molecules labeled with radioisotopes) are described. The advantages and challenges inherent to each of these approaches are discussed. Future directions, providing new guidelines for the successful translation of GNPs into clinical applications, are also highlighted.","['1 Centre de Recherche du Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Québec-Université Laval (CR-CHU de Québec), Axe Médecine Régénératrice, Québec, G1L 3L5, QC, Canada.', '2 Department of Mining, Metallurgy and Materials Engineering, Université Laval, Québec, G1V 0A6, QC, Canada.', '3 Centre de Recherche sur les Matériaux Avancés (CERMA), Université Laval, Québec, G1V 0A6, QC, Canada.']","Myriam Laprise-Pelletier, Teresa Simão, Marc-André Fortin, ",Advanced healthcare materials,2018 Aug,brachytherapy; gold nanoparticles; radioactive nanoparticles; radiotherapy.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29726118
164,Detective efficiency of photon counting detectors with spectral degradation and crosstalk,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      Charge sharing and migration of scattered and fluorescence photons in an energy discriminating photon counting detector (PCD) degrade the detector's energy response and can cause a single incident photon to be registered as multiple events at different energies among neighboring pixels, leading to spatio-energetic correlation. Such a correlation in conventional linear, space-invariant imaging system can be usefully characterized by the frequency dependent detective quantum efficiency DQE(f). Defining and estimating DQE(f) for PCDs in a manner consistent with that of conventional detectors is complicated because the traditional definition of DQE(f) does not address spectral information. Methods:
      
    

    
      We introduce the concept of presampling spectroscopic detective quantum efficiency, DQEs (f), and present an analysis of it for CdTe PCDs using a spatial domain method that starts from a previously described analytic computation of spatio-energetic crosstalk. DQEs (f) is estimated as the squared signal-to-noise ratio of the amplitude of a small-signal sinusoidal modulation of the object (cortical bone) thickness at frequency f estimated using data from the detector under consideration compared that obtained from the photon distribution incident on the detector. DQEs for material decomposition (spectral) and effective monoenergetic imaging tasks for different pixel pitch is studied based on the multipixel Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) that accounts for inter pixel basis material correlation. Effective monoenergetic DQEs is estimated from the CRLB of a linear weighted combination of basis materials, and its energy dependence is also studied. Results:
      
    

    
      Zero frequency DQEs for the spectral task was ~18%, 25%, and 34% for 250 μm, 500 μm, and 1 mm detector pixels respectively. Inter pixel signal correlation results in positive noise correlation between same basis material estimates of neighboring pixels, resulting in least impact on DQEs at the detector's Nyquist frequency. Effective monoenergetic DQEs (0) at the optimal energy is relatively tolerant of spectral degradation (85-91% depending on pixel size), but is highly dependent on the selected effective energy, with maximum variation (in 250 μm pixels) of 17% to 85% for effective energy between 30 to 120 keV. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our results show that spatio-energetic correlations degrade DQEs (f) beyond what is lost by poor spectral response in a single detector element. The positive correlation between computed single basis material values in neighboring pixels results in the penalty to DQEs (f) to be the least at the Nyquist frequency of the detector. It is desirable to reduce spectral degradation and crosstalk to minimize the impact on system performance. Larger pixels sizes have better spatio-energetic response due to lower charge sharing and escape of scatter and K-fluorescence photons, and therefore higher DQEs (0). Effective monoenergetic DQEs (0) at the optimal energy is much less affected by spectral degradation and crosstalk compared to DQEs for spectral tasks.","['1 Departments of Electrical Engineering and Radiology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA.', '2 Departments of Bioengineering and Radiology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA.', '3 Departments of Bioengineering, Radiology, and Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA.']","Paurakh L Rajbhandary, Mats Persson, Norbert J Pelc, ",Medical physics,2020 Jan,K-fluorescence escape; charge sharing; material decomposition; photon counting detector; spatio-energetic correlation; spectral CT.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31665541

Methodology: Chromatography separation was performed on an ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 Column with isocratic elution; the mobile phase was 0.1% formic acid aqueous solution (A) and acetonitrile (B) (A:B = 40:60, v/v). Data were recorded at an ultraviolet (UV) wavelength of 191 nm for Art, Art C, DHAA and AA, and 206 nm for Art B. Results: The calibration curves of the five sesquiterpene components were all linear with correlation coefficients more than 0.9990. The linear ranges were 31.44-1572 μg/mL, 25.48-1274 μg/mL, 40.56-2028 μg/mL, 31.44-1572 μg/mL and 26.88-1396 μg/mL for Art, Art B, Art C, DHAA and AA, respectively. The precision ranged from 0.08% to 2.88%, the stability was from 0.96% to 1.66%, and the repeatability was all within 2.42% and had a mean extraction recovery of 96.5% to 100.6%.

The intensity distributions of the modified PSFs often suffer from deteriorations caused by system aberrations, which greatly degrade the image contrast, resolution, or localization precision. We present an aberration correction method using a spiral-phase-based double-helix PSF as an aberration indicator, which is sensitive and quantitatively correlated to the spherical aberration, coma, and astigmatism. Superior to the routine iteration-based correction methods, the presented approach is iteration-free and the aberration coefficients can be directly calculated with the measured parameters, relieving the computing burden. The validity of the method is verified by both examining the intensity distribution of the conventional Gaussian PSF in three dimensions and observing muntjac skin fibroblast cells. This iteration-free correction method has a potential application in PSF engineering systems equipped with a spatial light modulator.","[""1 Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xi'an Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics, State Key Laboratory, China."", '2 University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, No.\xa019 Yuquan Road, Shijingshan District, Beijing 100049, China.', ""3 Xi'an Jiaotong University, No.\xa028 Xianning West Road, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710049, China.""]","Zhaojun Wang, Yanan Cai, Yansheng Liang, Dan Dan, Baoli Yao, Ming Lei, ",Journal of biomedical optics,2018 Sep,aberration correction; double-helix point spread function; iteration-free.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30182579

170,A novel method for fast image simulation of flat panel detectors,"We have developed a novel method for fast image simulation of flat panel detectors, based on the photon energy deposition efficiency and the optical spread function (OSF). The proposed method, FastEPID, determines the photon detection using photon energy deposition and replaces particle transport within the detector with precalculated OSFs. The FastEPID results are validated against experimental measurement and conventional Monte Carlo simulation in terms of modulation transfer function (MTF), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), contrast, and relative difference of pixel value, obtained with a slanted slit image, Las Vegas phantom, and anthropomorphic pelvis phantom. Excellent agreement is observed between simulation and measurement in all cases. Without degrading image quality, the FastEPID method is capable of reducing simulation time up to a factor of 150. Multiple applications, such as imager design optimization for planar and volumetric imaging, are expected to benefit from the implementation of the FastEPID method.","[""1 Medical Physics Program, Department of Physics and Applied Physics, University of Massachusetts Lowell, Lowell, MA 01854, United States of America.

171,Distribution of mid-peripheral cones in emmetropic and myopic subjects using adaptive optics flood illumination camera,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      We measured in vivo cone photoreceptors up to 24° of eccentricity along the horizontal meridian of healthy human retina. We also investigated the impact on cone densities of axial eye length elongation occurring with myopia. Methods:
      
    

    
      Using a flood illumination device coupled with an adaptive optics system, rtx1™, ( www.imagine-eyes.com), 55 right healthy retinas were imaged along the horizontal (i.e. nasal and temporal) meridian over a 48° field (i.e. from 3° to 24° each 3°). Then, cones were manually detected within 80 × 80 pixel regions of interest. Cone density and packing geometry (i.e. number of neighbours) were calculated (AOdetect software™). Subjects were divided into three groups: a group of 36 emmetropic (i.e. refractive error from -0.25D to +0.50D) subjects; a group of 10 low myopic subjects (i.e. refractive error from -0.50D to -2.50D); and a group of nine high myopic subjects (i.e. >-2.50D). Results:
      
    

    
      Cone density decreased with eccentricity in both semi-meridians. The decrease in cone photoreceptors occurred mainly in the first 9°. The difference of cone density between the nasal and temporal semi-meridian increased with eccentricity from 0.6% at 3° to 26% at 24°. Average cone density of emmetropes (850 cones deg-2 or 11 087 cones mm-2 ), low myopes (830 cones deg-2 or 9731 cones mm-2 ), and high myopes (912 cones deg-2 or 9744 cones mm-2 ), suggested that the retinas of the high myopic subjects were more stretched than the low myopic subjects retinas and even more stretched than that of the emmetropes. The axial eyeball elongation (square of the ratio of the axial eye length of 9%) seems to explain the cone density (11%) difference between emmetropes and low myopes. However, while the eyeball elongation between low and high myopes is still important (i.e. 11%), cone density difference between both populations was negligible (i.e. 3%). The ratio of cone density varied from -17% to 22% as a function of eccentricity involving that the retinal stretching is not uniform along the horizontal meridian. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The difference of cone density (i.e. cone mm-2 ) between groups supports the hypothesis that the retina is stretched with the eyeball elongation. However, this elongation does not seem to be uniform along the horizontal meridian favouring the hypothesis of a local elongation of the retina.","['1 Laboratoire Aimé Cotton, CNRS, Université Paris-Sud, ENS Paris-Saclay, Université Paris-Saclay, Orsay, France.']","Kelly Woog, Richard Legras, ",Ophthalmic & physiological optics : the journal of the British College of Ophthalmic Opticians (Optometrists),2019 Mar,cone density; myopia; peripheral retina; retinal stretching.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30697790

174,Dual-core all-fiber integrated immunosensor for detection of protein antigens,"An optical fiber interferometric microprobe for detection of specific proteins is presented in this paper. The microprobe is an all-fiber device, which is based on Michelson interferometer configuration, which allows for detection of protein antigens in an analyzed solution thanks to antibodies immobilized on the sensor surface. The interferometer is made of dual core fiber and has a precisely formed arm length difference, achieved by splicing a fragment of polarization maintaining fiber to one of the cores. An all-fiber configuration of the sensor decreases substantially cross-sensitivities to temperature and deformation in comparison to other optical fiber interferometers. Reported sensor has a sensing region on the tip of the interferometer and therefore may be used for point measurements in medicine. The immunosensor and optical measuring system are designed to utilize the most common broadband light sources that operate at a central wavelength of 1.55 µm. The results show that it is possible to detect a protein antigen present in a solution by using an all-fiber interferometer coated with specific antibodies. The resulting peak shift can reaches 0.6 nm, which is sufficient to be measured by an optical spectrum analyzer or a spectrometer. A model allowing for estimation of the value of lower limit of detection for such sensors has been elaborated. The elaborated detection system may act as a framework for detection of various antigens and thus it can find future applications in medical diagnostics.","['1 InPhoTech Sp. z o. o., ul.

The results showed that tumor growth rate, lung metastasis, shortening of the survival of the tumor-bearing mice, and tumor microvessel formation were promoted 2- to 3-fold, and expression of angiogenic and metastatic genes increased 1.5- to 15-fold in regrown tumors after repeated photon irradiations, whereas repeated C-ion irradiations did not alter these characteristics. Interestingly, both repeated photon and C-ion irradiations did not generate radioresistance, which is generally acquired for in vitro treatment. Our results demonstrated that the repetition of photon, and not C-ion, irradiations in vivo alter the characteristics of the regrown tumor, making it more aggressive without acquisition of radioresistance.","['1 Cancer Metastasis Research Team, Advanced Radiation Biology Research Program, Research Center for Charged Particle Therapy, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, QST, 4-9-1 Anagawa, Inage-ku, Chiba, 263-8555, Japan.', '2 Clinical Genetic Oncology, Cancer Institute Hospital, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, 3-8-31 Koto-Ku, Tokyo, 135-8550, Japan.', '3 Department of Molecular Imaging and Theranostics, and Group of Quantum-state Controlled MRI, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, QST, 4-9-1 Anagawa, Inage-ku, Chiba, 263-8555, Japan.', '4 National Institute of Radiological Sciences, QST, 4-9-1 Anagawa, Inage-ku, Chiba, 263-8555, Japan.', '5 Cancer Metastasis Research Team, Advanced Radiation Biology Research Program, Research Center for Charged Particle Therapy, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, QST, 4-9-1 Anagawa, Inage-ku, Chiba, 263-8555, Japan. shimokawa.takashi@qst.go.jp.']","Katsutoshi Sato, Nobuhiro Nitta, Ichio Aoki, Takashi Imai, Takashi Shimokawa, ",Scientific reports,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29362374
176,Precise measurement of inner diameter of mono-capillary optic using X-ray imaging technique,"Background:
      
    

    
      Mono-capillary optics have been applied to increase the performance of X-ray instruments. However, performance of a mono-capillary optic strongly depends on the shape accuracy, which is determined by the diameters of the inner hollow of the capillary along the axial direction. Objective:
      
    

    
      To precisely determine the inner diameter of the capillary optic used in X-ray imaging technique, which aims to replace the conventional method using a visible microscope. Methods:
      
    

    
      High spatial resolution X-ray images of the mono-capillary optic were obtained by a synchrotron radiation beamline. The inner diameter of the mono-capillary optic was measured and analyzed by the pixel values of the X-ray image. Result:
      
    

    
      Edge enhancement effect was quite useful in determining the inner diameter, and the accuracy of the diameter determination was less than 1.32 μm. Many images obtained by scanning the mono-capillary optic along the axial direction were combined, and the axial profile, consisting of diameters along the axial direction, was obtained from the combined image. The X-ray imaging method could provide an accurate measurement with slope error of±19 μrad. Conclusions:

This work explores the application of such biophotonic nanostructures of butterfly wing for acoustic detection and voice recognition. The pressure variation of the acoustic waves induces the vibration of butterfly wing diaphragm, resulting in the periodic change of reflectance. The integrated butterfly wing-based acoustic sensor shows high fidelity in replicating the original acoustic signals. The sensor also demonstrates promise in distinguishing human voices, which provides an alternative approach for voice recognition.","['1 State Key Laboratory of Metal Matrix Composites, School of Materials Science and Engineering , Shanghai Jiao Tong University , 800 Dong Chuan Road , Shanghai 200240 , P.

182,Sensing performance optimization of the Bloch surface wave biosensor based on the Bloch impedance-matching method,"We propose a novel strategy to optimize sensing performance of the Bloch surface wave (BSW) biosensor. First of all, a one-dimensional photonic crystal with an omnidirectional photonic bandgap is designed. Except for sustaining the BSW, the omnidirectional photonic bandgap guarantees a tiny full width at half maximum (FWHM=0.84 nm) for the reflection dip induced by BSW resonance. Then, the specific dependence of wavelength sensitivity on incident angle is obtained by the Bloch impedance-matching method. Study shows that wavelength sensitivity increases with the decreases in incident angle (larger than the critical angle). At the same time, when the incident angle approaches the critical angle (θ=67.5 deg), wavelength sensitivity increases rapidly (Sλ=1570 nm/RIU). Moreover, theoretical research reveals that biosensor sensitivity can also be further enhanced by other system parameters. Combining the tiny FWHM of the reflection dip and large wavelength sensitivity, the figure of merit of the optimized biosensor can reach as high as 1869 RIU-1. These results enable the design of biosensors with high performance in a predictable manner.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Ji Ma, Xiu-Bao Kang, Zhi-Guo Wang, ",Optics letters,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30383011

      Reliability and validity analysis. Methods:
      
    

    
      Using an analysis involving geometric optics, the effective prism power (EPP), measured in prism diopters (PD), was calculated for glass and acrylic prisms and was the main outcome measure. These results were also validated using optical bench measurements. No patients were involved. Results:
      
    

    
      Plotting the calculated effective prism power as a function of rotational angle produced curves demonstrating that the frontal plane position lies along the flatter portions of the curves, while the Prentice position lies along the steeper portions of the curves. Calculated values of prism power for the standard clinical positions as well as the percentage errors from accepted standards were compared. Acrylic prisms can be held in the frontal plane position with acceptable amounts of error (<5%) for prisms up to 50 PD. Glass prisms are capable of producing significant errors for measurements much greater than 10 PD. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The use of glass prisms as currently calibrated should be abandoned or at least limited to small measurements. Acrylic prisms produce acceptable errors if careful attention is given to their position.","['1 Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, Texas, USA.

For deep tissue in vivo applications, large-scale two-photon based near simultaneous 3D laser excitation is needed. Although 3D holographic laser excitation is nowadays common practice, the inherent short coherence length of the commonly used femtosecond pulses fundamentally restricts the achievable field-of-view. Here we report a technique for near simultaneous large-scale femtosecond holographic 3D excitation.

189,Multimodal imaging of torpedo maculopathy including adaptive optics,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      The etiology of torpedo maculopathy remains unknown, but it has been recently suggested that it could represent a persistent defect in the development of the retinal pigment epithelium. As retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors form a functional unit, an alteration of photoreceptor distribution or function is predictable. The aim of this study is to describe multimodal imaging, including adaptive optics, in three cases of torpedo maculopathy, and discuss its pathogenesis. Methods:
      
    

    
      Multimodal imaging is presented, including fundus photographs, optical coherence tomography, adaptive optics, autofluorescence, fluorescein angiography, and ultra-widefield retinal imaging in three cases of torpedo maculopathy. Results:
      
    

    
      An oval-shaped well-delimited chorioretinal lesion both hypopigmented centrally and with a hyperpigmented border in the temporal macula, consistent with torpedo maculopathy, was observed in three patients. Optical coherence tomography showed a preservation of the inner retina, a mild atrophy of the outer retina, an alteration of the ellipsoid zone and of the retinal pigment epithelium layer, and a neurosensory detachment. These lesions were hypoautofluorescent with a hyperautofluorescent border. Fluorescein angiography showed a hyperfluorescence by window effect. Adaptive optics imaging showed an alteration of the cone mosaic within the lesions, with a lower cone density and a higher spacing between cones. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The alteration of the cone mosaic suggested by adaptive optics in torpedo maculopathy has never been described and could be explained by the alteration of the retinal pigment epithelium.

190,The relative biological effectiveness of proton irradiation in dependence of DNA damage repair,"Clinical parameters and empirical evidence are the primary determinants for current treatment planning in radiation oncology. Personalized medicine in radiation oncology is only at the very beginning to take the genetic background of a tumor entity into consideration to define an individual treatment regimen, the total dose or the combination with a specific anticancer agent. Likewise, stratification of patients towards proton radiotherapy is linked to its physical advantageous energy deposition at the tumor site with minimal healthy tissue being co-irradiated distal to the target volume. Hence, the fact that photon and proton irradiation also induce different qualities of DNA damages, which require differential DNA damage repair mechanisms has been completely neglected so far. These subtle differences could be efficiently exploited in a personalized treatment approach and could be integrated into personalized treatment planning. A differential requirement of the two major DNA double-strand break repair pathways, homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining, was recently identified in response to proton and photon irradiation, respectively, and subsequently influence the mode of ionizing radiation-induced cell death and susceptibility of tumor cells with defects in DNA repair machineries to either quality of ionizing radiation.This review focuses on the differential DNA-damage responses and subsequent biological processes induced by photon and proton irradiation in dependence of the genetic background and discusses their impact on the unicellular level and in the tumor microenvironment and their implications for combined treatment modalities.","['1 Laboratory for Applied Radiobiology Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, Raemistrasse 100, CH-8091 Zurich, Switzerland.']","Simon Deycmar, Erica Faccin, Tamara Kazimova, Philip A Knobel, Irma Telarovic, Fabienne Tschanz, Verena Waller, Rona Winkler, Carmen Yong, Dario Zingariello, Martin Pruschy, ",The British journal of radiology,2020 Mar,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31687835

The effects of eccentricity, meridian, axial length, spherical equivalent, gender and age were evaluated. Cone density decreased on average from 28 884 ± 3 692 cones/mm2, at 2° of eccentricity, to 15 843 ± 1 598 cones/mm2 at 6°. A strong inter-individual variation, especially at 2°, was observed. No important difference of cone density was observed between the nasal and temporal meridians or between the superior and inferior meridians. However, the horizontal and vertical meridians differed by around 14% (T-test, p<0.0001). Cone density, expressed in units of area, decreased as a function of axial length (r2 = 0.60), but remained constant (r2 = 0.05) when cone density is expressed in terms of visual angle supporting the hypothesis that the retina is stretched during the elongation of the eyeball. Gender did not modify the cone distribution. Cone density was slightly modified by age but only at 2°. The older group showed a smaller density (7%). Cone spacing increased from 6,49 ± 0,42 μm to 8,72 ± 0,45 μm respectively between 2° and 6° of eccentricity.

However, neural factors such as blur sensitivity and defocus adaptation may play an important role on the extent of DOF. A series of experiments were conducted to study if optical or neural factors are most pertinent in explaining the variability of DOF across subjects. An adaptive optics system with a black and white target, a 3.8-mm artificial pupil, and a subjective criterion (based on objectionable blur) were used to measure depth of field ([DOFi]; DOF computed in the object space) in 11 participants, after at least 6 min of adaptation. This was done under three conditions: (a) with their own higher order aberrations (HOA); (b) after correction of their monochromatic HOA; and (c) after altering the HOA pattern for some participants to reflect the HOA pattern measured for a different participant. Natural DOFi and DOFi after HOA correction were positively correlated (R2 = 0.461), but a significant decrease in DOFi (21% on average) was found after HOA correction (p = 0.042). Effect of HOA on the intersubject variability of DOFi was 3.9 times smaller than the effect of the image neural processing. This study shows that DOFi depends on both optical and neural factors, but the latter seems to play a more important role than the former.","['1 Grupo de Investigación en Ciencias de la Visión, Universidad de Murcia, Murcia, Spain.', '2 Faculty of Biology, Medicine & Health, The University of Manchester, Manchester Academic Health Science Center, Manchester, UK.', '3 Department of Ophthalmology and Vision Sciences, School of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA.']","Juan F Zapata-Díaz, Iván Marín-Franch, Hema Radhakrishnan, Norberto López-Gil, ",Journal of vision,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30458513

The total concentration of rare earths and their bioaccumulation factors were determined in root, hypocotyl, and leaves of R. sativus after 72 h, and in L. minor fronds after 168 h. In R. sativus, translocation factors were determined as the ratio of rare earths concentration in hypocotyl versus root and in leaves versus hypocotyl. The lengths of the root and hypocotyl in R. sativus, as well as the frond area in L. minor, were monitored as toxicity endpoints. To distinguish rare earth bioaccumulation patterns, two-dimensional maps of elemental distribution in the whole R. sativus plant and L. minor fronds were obtained by laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy with a lateral resolution of 100 μm. Moreover, the bioaccumulation was inspected using a photon-upconversion laser microscanner. The results revealed that the tested nanoparticles became adsorbed onto L. minor fronds and R. sativus roots, as well as transferred from roots through the hypocotyl and into leaves of R. sativus. The bioaccumulation patterns and spatial distribution of rare earths in nanoparticle-treated plants therefore differed from those of the positive control. Overall, carboxylated silica-coated photon-upconversion nanoparticles are stable, can easily translocate from roots to leaves, and are expected to become adsorbed onto the plant surface. They are also significantly toxic to the tested plants at nominal concentrations of 100 and 1000 μg/mL.","['1 Central European Institute of Technology (CEITEC), Brno University of Technology, Technická 3058/10, 616 00, Brno, Czech Republic.

195,Calculation of the geometrical point-spread function from wavefront aberrations,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      This report uses the principles of geometrical optics to compute the optical point-spread function (PSF) from the wavefront error function. Method:
      
    

    
      Step 1 uses Prentice's rule to determine the spatial form of the PSF established by tracing a field of rays from the eye's exit pupil to the retina. Ray vergence is related to the slope of the wavefront error function, which enables the mapping of light rays to produce a retinal 'spot diagram'. Step 2 completes the PSF by assigning an irradiance value to each ray in the spot diagram. Results and conclusions:
      
    

    
      Spot irradiance is inversely proportional to the Gaussian curvature (i.e. the product of principal curvatures) of each local region of wavefront error surface centered on the corresponding ray. The Gaussian curvature, in turn, may be computed as the determinant of the vergence error matrix associated with each point on the wavefront error surface. Elements of the vergence error matrix consist of sums and differences of the local power vector components M, J0 and J45 . This method is shown to be equivalent to published derivations of the geometric PSF using the Jacobian of the ray mapping function and equivalent also to the Hessian of the wavefront error function. Examples are presented for the familiar cases of spherical and astigmatic blur as well as for higher order aberrations and the formation of caustics in the retinal image.","['1 School of Optometry, Indiana University, Bloomington, USA.']","Larry N Thibos, ",Ophthalmic & physiological optics : the journal of the British College of Ophthalmic Opticians (Optometrists),2019 Jul,aberrations; astigmatism; optics.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31172533

      Thirty-six radiotherapy plans were produced for the same CT. 6, 10, 15 and 18 MV 3DCRT, IMRT and VMAT (77.4 Gy in 43 fractions) and 6 and 10 MV SBRT (36.25 Gy in 5 fractions with flattened and FFF beams) for Elekta, Siemens and Varian Linacs plans were included. DVH and peripheral organ dosimetry were used to compute TCP, NTCP, and SPCR (the competition and LNT models) for further plan ranking. Results:
      
    

    
      Biological models (and parameters) used predicted an outcome which is in agreement with epidemiological findings. SBRT plans showed the lowest SPCR and a below average NTCPrectal. High energy plans did not rank worse than the low energy ones. Intensity modulated plans were ranked above the 3D conformal techniques. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      According to UCFCP, the best plans were the10 MV SBRTs. SPCR rates were low and did not show a substantial impact on plan ranking. High energy intensity-modulated plans did not increase in excess the average of SPCR. Even more, they ranked among the best, provided that MU were efficiently managed.","['1 Instituto de Física, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago, Chile.

197,Cascaded systems analysis of charge sharing in cadmium telluride photon-counting x-ray detectors,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      Single-photon-counting (SPC) and spectroscopic x-ray detectors are under development in academic and industry laboratories for medical imaging applications. The spatial resolution of SPC and spectroscopic x-ray detectors is an important design criterion. The purpose of this article was to extend the cascaded systems approach to include a description of the spatial resolution of SPC and spectroscopic x-ray imaging detectors. Methods:
      
    

    
      A cascaded systems approach was used to model reabsorption of characteristic x rays, Coulomb repulsion, and diffusion in SPC and spectroscopic x-ray detectors. In addition to reabsorption, diffusion, and Coulomb repulsion, the model accounted for x-ray conversion to electron-hole (e-h) pairs, integration of e-h pairs in detector elements, electronic noise, and energy thresholding. The probability density function (PDF) describing the number of e-h pairs was propagated through each stage of the model and was used to derive new theoretical expressions for the large-area gain and modulation transfer function (MTF) of CdTe SPC x-ray detectors, and the energy bin sensitivity functions and MTFs of CdTe spectroscopic detectors. Theoretical predictions were compared with the results of MATLAB-based Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and published data. Comparisons were also made with the MTF of energy-integrating systems. Results:
      
    

    
      Under general radiographic conditions, reabsorption, diffusion, and Coulomb repulsion together artificially inflate count rates by 20% to 50%. For thicker converters (e.g. 1000 μm) and larger detector elements (e.g. 500 μm pixel pitch) these processes result in modest inflation (i.e. ∼10%) in apparent count rates. Our theoretical and MC analyses predict that SPC MTFs will be degraded relative to those of energy-integrating systems for fluoroscopic, general radiographic, and CT imaging conditions. In most cases, this degradation is modest (i.e., ∼10% at the Nyquist frequency). However, for thicker converters, the SPC MTF can be degraded by up to 25% at the Nyquist frequency relative to EI systems. Additionally, unlike EI systems, the MTF of spectroscopic systems is strongly dependent on photon energy, which results in energy-bin-dependent spatial resolution in spectroscopic systems. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The PDF-transfer approach to modeling signal transfer through SPC and spectroscopic x-ray imaging systems provides a framework for understanding system performance. Application of this approach demonstrated that charge sharing artificially inflates the SPC image signal and degrades the MTF of SPC and spectroscopic systems relative to energy-integrating systems. These results further motivate the need for anticharge-sharing circuits to mitigate the effects of charge sharing on SPC and spectroscopic x-ray image quality.","['1 Department of Physics, University of British Columbia Okanagan, Kelowna, BC, V1Y 1V7, Canada.', '2 Imaging Research Laboratories, Robarts Research Institute, The University of Western Ontario, London, ON, N6A 5B7, Canada.', '3 Department of Medical Biophysics, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, The University of Western Ontario, London, ON, N6A 5C1, Canada.', '4 Biomedical Engineering, Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, The University of Western Ontario, London, ON, N6A 5C1, Canada.']","Jesse Tanguay, Ian A Cunningham, ",Medical physics,2018 May,cadmium telluride; cascaded systems analysis; photoncounting; spatial resolution; spectroscopic x-ray detectors; x-ray detectors.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29526029

In this report, the BRAPHYQS (BRAchytherapy PHYsics Quality assurance System) working group of GEC-ESTRO, has developed the present recommendations to assure harmonized and high-quality seed calibration in European clinics. There are practical aspects for which a clarification/procedure is needed, including aspects not specifically accounted for in currently existing AAPM and ESTRO societal recommendations. The aim of this report has been to provide a European wide standard in LE-LDR source calibration at end-user level, in order to keep brachytherapy treatments with high safety and quality levels.

199,Monte Carlo study of ionization chamber magnetic field correction factors as a function of angle and beam quality,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      To use EGSnrc Monte Carlo simulations for magnetic field dosimetry to determine optimal measurement orientations, calculate beam quality conversion factors for 32 cylindrical and three parallel-plate (PP) ion chambers, evaluate the beam quality and angular dependence of these factors, and examine the magnetic field effects on %dd(10)x and TPR1020. Methods:
      
    

    
      Beam quality conversion factors, kQmag, and magnetic field conversion factors, kB = kQmag/kQ , are calculated as a function of chamber rotation for six cylindrical ionization chamber in either a 60 Co beam with a 0.35 T magnetic field or a 7 MV beam with a 1.5 T field, both magnetic fields are perpendicular to the photon beam. The chambers' sensitive air volumes are varied by either using the entire geometric volume or excluding the air volume associated with the first 1 mm away from the stem. The kB and kQmag factors are evaluated using four clinical photon spectra. The variation in %dd(10)x and TPR1020 as a function of magnetic field for six photon spectra are studied using DOSXYZnrc. Results:
      
    

    
      When the magnetic field is perpendicular to the photon beam, orienting the chamber parallel with the magnetic field reduces the magnetic field effect on chamber response (i.e., dose to air per water dose) and variations due to the unknown sensitive volume are essentially eliminated. Calculated kB factors are within 1% of unity for the majority of cylindrical chambers, although larger kB values are associated with chambers with high-Z electrodes. PP chambers have kB corrections as large as 8.9% and have a larger angular sensitivity compared to cylindrical chambers. Values of kB for cylindrical ion chambers are independent of beam quality, except for chambers with high-Z electrodes. For %dd(10)x values between 63.3% and 73.8%, kB varies by at most (0.26 ± 0.15)% when the magnetic field is perpendicular to the photon beam and parallel to the chamber. Differences in %dd(10)x , between no magnetic field and with a 1.5 T field perpendicular to the photon beam are (0.04 ± 0.10)%, (1.89 ± 0.10)%, and (6.20 ± 0.10)% for a 60 Co, 7, and 25 MV photon beam, respectively, while TPR1020 shows less than (0.36 ± 0.10)% change. Applying the ICRU-90 recommendations for stopping powers instead of ICRU-37 is found to change kQ (and hence kB ) by less than 0.1%. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Orienting the chamber parallel to the magnetic field when the field is perpendicular to the photon beam will minimize the effect of the magnetic field on chamber response, and eliminate the problem of the unknown sensitive volume. Values of kB and kQmag can bring ion chamber dosimetry in magnetic fields in-line with the TG-51 protocol. PP chamber are sensitive to the magnetic field and variation in chamber response due to small angular changes makes them unlikely candidates for clinical reference dosimetry in magnetic fields. The stability in TPR1020, as a function of magnetic fields and beam qualities, makes it the best beam quality specifier in magnetic fields.","['1 Carleton Laboratory for Radiotherapy Physics, Physics Dept, Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada.']","Victor N Malkov, D W O Rogers, ",Medical physics,2018 Feb,EGSnrc; Monte Carlo; dosimetry; ion chambers; magnetic fields.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29218730

Compared to multilayered and voxel-based MCs, MMC can utilize tetrahedral meshes to gain improved anatomical accuracy but also results in higher computational and memory demands. Previous attempts of accelerating MMC using graphics processing units (GPUs) have yielded limited performance improvement and are not publicly available. We report a highly efficient MMC-MMCL-using the OpenCL heterogeneous computing framework and demonstrate a speedup ratio up to 420× compared to state-of-the-art single-threaded CPU simulations. The MMCL simulator supports almost all advanced features found in our widely disseminated MMC software, such as support for a dozen of complex source forms, wide-field detectors, boundary reflection, photon replay, and storing a rich set of detected photon information.

201,Introducing the concept of spiral microbeam radiation therapy (spiralMRT),"Motivation:
      
    

    
      With interlaced microbeam radiation therapy (MRT) a first kilovoltage radiotherapy (RT) concept combining spatially fractionated entrance beams and homogeneous dose distribution at the target exists. However, this technique suffers from its high sensitivity to positioning errors of the target relative to the radiation source. With spiral microbeam radiation therapy (spiralMRT), this publication introduces a new irradiation geometry, offering similar spatial fractionation properties as interlaced MRT, while being less vulnerable to target positioning uncertainties. Methods:
      
    

    
      The dose distributions achievable with spiralMRT in a simplified human head geometry were calculated with Monte Carlo simulations based on Geant4 and the dependence of the result on the microbeam pitch, total field size, and photon energy were analysed. A comparison with interlaced MRT and conventional megavoltage tomotherapy was carried out. Results:
      
    

    
      SpiralMRT can deliver homogeneous dose distributions, while using spatially fractionated entrance beams. The valley dose of spiralMRT entrance beams is by up to 40% lower than the corresponding tomotherapy dose, thus indicating a better normal tissue sparing. The optimum photon energy is found to be around [Formula: see text]. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      SpiralMRT is a promising approach to delivering homogeneous dose distributions with spatially fractionated entrance beams, possibly decreasing normal tissue side effects in hypofractionated RT.","['1 European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Biomedical beamline ID17, Grenoble, France.

This is realized by investigating the behavior of the average crossing number, the mean writhe, and the minimal crossing number of photons' paths generated by Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, for different sets of optical parameters. It is observed that the complexity of the photons' paths increases for increasing light source/detector spacing, and that highly ""knotted"" paths are formed.

204,Time-of-flight computed tomography - proof of principle,"Computed tomography has greatly improved over the last decade, especially through x-ray dose exposure reduction while maintaining image quality. Herein, a new concept is proposed to improve the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) by including the time-of-flight (TOF) information of individual photons to obtain further insight on the photon's trajectory and to reject scatter contribution. The proof of the concept relies on both simulation and experimental measurements in a cone-beam computed tomography arrangement. Results show a statistical difference between the TOF of scattered and primary photons exploitable in TOF computed tomography. For a large volume of the size of a human abdomen, a scatter reduction from 296% to 4% is achieved in our simulation setup with perfect timing measurements which yields a 110% better CNR, or a dose reduction by a factor of four. Cup artifacts are also reduced from 24.7% to 0.8%, and attenuation inaccuracies are improved from -26.3% to -0.8%. With 100 ps and 10 ps FWHM timing jitters, respectively 75% and 95% of the scatter contribution can be removed with marginal gains below 10 ps. Experimental measurements confirm the feasibility of measuring statistical differences between the TOF of scattered and primary photons.","[""1 Institut Interdisciplinaire d'Innovation Technologique (3IT), Université de Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, Québec, Canada.

205,Photonic crystal and plasmonic nanohole based label-free biodetection,"Photonic crystals and plasmonic nanohole arrays are the conventional substrates for label-free biodetection applications. In this article, we readdressed these systems in terms of their sensing capability and provided a broad picture for a selection mechanism of optimum parameters providing strong sensing signals. We first investigated the physical origin of the transmission resonances supported by the two systems, which is the core of the label-free sensing mechanism, relying on strong light-matter interactions. We conducted an extensive theoretical study on optical and sensing properties of the two systems, e.g., linewidth of the optical modes, refractive index sensitivity and figure-of-merit capacities. Our theoretical analyses provided a rule-of-thumb method for the selection of geometrical device parameters of the two systems. In order to experimentally investigate the sensing properties, we fabricated the two systems via a lift-off free fabrication method based on electron beam lithography, where the plasmonic nanohole arrays are realized by covering the phonic crystal surface with a thin metal. As an example, we demonstrated the sensing strength of two systems with identical dimensions by monitoring the spectral variations within their optical responses. We also performed label-free sensing experiments through detection of protein mono- and bilayers, where the geometrical parameters favor the plasmonic sensor system. Integrating a high-resolution optical read-out scheme with a multi-spectral data tracking technique, we achieved an experimentally minimum detectable protein concentration as low as 200 pg/mL for the plasmonic nanohole array and 1 ng/mL for the photonic crystal-based sensing platform.","['1 Izmir Biomedicine and Genome Center, 35340 Balcova, Izmir, Turkey.

206,Biological Material Interfaces as Inspiration for Mechanical and Optical Material Designs,"The extraordinary properties of biological materials often result from their sophisticated hierarchical structures. Through multilevel and cross-scale structural designs, biological materials offset the weakness of their individual building blocks and enhance performance at multiple length scales to match the multifunctional needs of organisms. One essential merit of hierarchical structure is that it can optimize the interfacial features of the ""building blocks"" at different length scales, from the molecular level to the macroscale. Understanding the roles of biological material interfaces (BMIs) on the determination of properties and functions of biological materials has become a growing interdisciplinary research area in recent years. A pivotal aim of these studies is to use BMIs as inspiration for developing bioinspired and biomimetic materials and devices with advanced structures and functions. Given these considerations, this review aims to comprehensively discuss the structure-property-function relationships of BMIs in nature. We particularly focus on the discussion of BMIs and their inspired materials from mechanical and optical perspectives because these two directions are the most well-investigated and closely related. The challenges and directions of design and fabrication of BMI-inspired mechanical and optical materials are also discussed. This review is expected to garner interest from advanced material communities as well as environmental, nanotechnology, food processing, and engineering fields.","['1 School of Physical Science and Technology , ShanghaiTech University , 393 Middle Huaxia Road , Shanghai 201210 , China.', '2 Department of Biomedical Engineering , Tufts University , Medford , Massachusetts 02155 , United States.', '3 State Key Laboratory for Modification of Chemical Fibers and Polymer Materials, International Joint Laboratory for Advanced Fiber and Low-Dimension Materials, College of Materials Science and Engineering , Donghua University , Shanghai 201620 , China.', '4 Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering , Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Cambridge , Massachusetts 02139 , United States.']","Jing Ren, Yu Wang, Yuan Yao, Yang Wang, Xiang Fei, Ping Qi, Shihui Lin, David L Kaplan, Markus J Buehler, Shengjie Ling, ",Chemical reviews,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31793285
207,"NCRP Report 181, Evaluation of the Relative Effectiveness of Low-energy Photons and Electrons in Inducing Cancer in Humans: A Critique and Alternative Analysis","A recent report from the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements presents an evaluation of the effectiveness of low-energy photons and electrons, relative to higher-energy photons, in inducing cancer in humans. The objective of that evaluation was to develop subjective probability distributions of an uncertain quantity, denoted by ρ, to represent ranges of credible values of the effectiveness of five groups of low-energy radiations (L): photons at about 1.5 keV; 15 to 30 keV photons; 40 to 60 keV photons; >60 to 150 keV photons; and electrons from beta decay of tritium (H). Probability distributions of ρL for all low-energy groups were derived based on an evaluation of uncertainties in data on biological effectiveness from five areas of research and use of an elicitation process and decomposition method to combine probability distributions to represent those uncertainties. In this paper, we argue that uncertainties in ρLs for all low-energy groups are too small compared with uncertainties in biological effectiveness from the different areas of research, especially that upper confidence limits of all ρLs are too low. These deflations of uncertainty in all ρLs apparently are due, at least in part, to an invalid assumption in the decomposition method that probability distributions of biological effectiveness from the different areas of research are representations of random uncertainty that arises from repeated measurements of the same quantity under the same conditions using well-calibrated instruments. However, those distributions essentially are representations of systematic uncertainty in different estimates of biological effectiveness from each area of research, which means that a deflation of uncertainty in ρLs is not a credible result. We then use the same probability distributions of biological effectiveness from the different areas of research in an alternative analysis to derive wider probability distributions of ρL that we believe provide a better representation of the state of knowledge of the effectiveness of low-energy photons and electrons in inducing cancer in humans. Our analysis is based on the notion that each probability distribution of biological effectiveness from an area of research represents a distinctly different model of a ρL and use of the concept of model averaging to combine those distributions.","['1 1Oak Ridge Center for Risk Analysis, Inc., 102 Donner Drive, Oak Ridge, TN 37830.', '2 Oak Ridge Center for Risk Analysis, Inc., 102 Donner Drive, Oak Ridge, TN 37830.']","David C Kocher, F Owen Hoffman, ",Health physics,2019 Jun,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30889098
208,The output factor correction as function of the photon beam field size - direct measurement and calculation from the lateral dose response functions of gas-filled and solid detectors,"The first aim of this study has been to extend the systematic experimental study of the field size dependence of the output factor correction for three micro-ionization chambers (PTW 31014, PTW 31022 and IBA Razor chamber), two silicon diodes (PTW 60017 and IBA Razor Diode) and the synthetic diamond detector microDiamond (PTW 60019) in a 6 MV photon beam down to an effective field side length of 2.6mm, and to summarize the present knowledge of this factor by treating it as a function of the dosimetric field size. In order to vary the dosimetric field size over this large range, output factors measurements were performed at source-to-surface distances of 60cm and 90cm. Since the output factors obtained with the organic scintillation detector Exradin W1 (Standard Imaging, Middleton, USA) at all field sizes closely agreed with those measured by EBT3 radiochromic films (ISP Corp, Wayne, USA), the scintillation detector served as the reference detector. The measured output correction factors reflect the influences of the volume averaging and density effects upon the uncorrected output factor values. In case of the microDiamond detector these opposing influences result in output factor correction values less than 1 for moderately small field sizes and larger than 1 for very small field sizes. Our results agree with most of the published experimental as well as Monte-Carlo simulated data within detector-specific limits of uncertainty. The dosimetric field side length has been identified as a reliable determinant of the output factor correction, and typical functional curve shapes of the field-size dependent output factor correction vs. dosimetric field side length have been associated with gas-filled, silicon diode and synthetic diamond detectors. The second aim of this study has been a novel, semi-empirical approach to calculate the field-size dependent output correction factors of small photon detectors by convolving film measured true dose profile data with measured lateral response functions of the detectors. To achieve this, the set of previously published 2D lateral dose response functions was complemented by those of the novel detectors PTW PinPoint chamber 31022 (PTW Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany), Razor chamber and Razor Diode (IBA Dosimetry, Schwarzenbruck, Germany). The output correction factors calculated from the lateral dose response functions closely fit with the directly measured output correction factors, thus supporting the latter by an independent method.","['1 University Clinic for Medical Radiation Physics, Medical Campus Pius-Hospital, Carl von Ossietzky University, Georgstraße 12, 26121 Oldenburg, Germany.

209,Enhanced cavitation activity in a slab-shaped optical absorber during photo-mediated ultrasound therapy,"Recently, new studies have shown that combined laser and ultrasound, or photo-mediated ultrasound therapy (PUT), can enhance cavitation in optically absorptive targets to disrupt tissues through photoacoustic (PA) effect. These studies, including both experimental and theoretical investigations, have largely focused on blood vessels, which are modeled as cylindrically-shaped optical absorbers for PA wave generation and propagation. However, in many clinical situations, target tissues may not be cylindrically-shaped. In this paper we investigated the effect of PUT on a slab-shaped optical absorber, much larger than the size of the laser beam or the ultrasound focal point. Our results demonstrated that laser light could generate a PA wave that could enhance cavitation not only at the surface of a slab, but also at depths when combined with ultrasound, suggesting that PUT may be effective in enhancing cavitation in a large range of soft tissues. Our results also demonstrated that the cavitation enhancement was based on the optical absorption of the targeted tissue, allowing for self-targeting treatments when optical contrast is present. Additionally, we demonstrated that for the greatest cavitation enhancement in deeper layers a focused laser beam geometry would be most effective.","['1 Bioengineering Program and Institute for Bioengineering Research, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, United States of America.']","David Hazlewood, Xinmai Yang, ",Physics in medicine and biology,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31715592

Herein, we explore the origins of cavity modes in CsPbBr3 microplatelets (MPs) lasers by using angle-resolved microphotoluminescence Fourier imaging technique, which is still controversial so far. In-plane Fabry-Pérot (F-P) mode lasing transition to whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) lasing is verified at room temperature, which mostly occurs in large MPs with edge length (L) over 13 μm. The F-P lasing is suppressed upon decreasing L or increasing excitation density, and the WGM lasing is predominant for all MPs at high excitation density.

212,Strategies to reduce mass and photons transfer limitations in heterogeneous photocatalytic processes: Hexavalent chromium reduction studies,"The current work presents different approaches to overcome mass and photon transfer limitations in heterogeneous photocatalytic processes applied to the reduction of hexavalent chromium to its trivalent form in the presence of a sacrificial agent. Two reactor designs were tested, a monolithic tubular photoreactor (MTP) and a micro-meso-structured photoreactor (NETmix), both presenting a high catalyst surface area per reaction liquid volume. In order to reduce photon transfer limitations, the tubular photoreactor was packed with transparent cellulose acetate monolithic structures (CAM) coated with the catalyst by a dip-coating method. For the NETmix reactor, a thin film of photocatalyst was uniformly deposited on the front glass slab (GS) or on the network of channels and chambers imprinted in the back stainless steel slab (SSS) using a spray system. The reaction rate for the NETmix photoreactor was evaluated for two illumination sources, solar light or UVA-LEDs, using the NETmix with the front glass slab or/and back stainless steel slab coated with TiO2-P25. The reusability of the photocatalytic films on the NETmix walls was also evaluated for three consecutive cycles using fresh Cr(VI) solutions. The catalyst reactivity in combination with the NETmix-SSS photoreactor is almost 70 times superior to one obtained with the MTP.","['1 Laboratory of Separation and Reaction Engineering - Laboratory of Catalysis and Materials (LSRE-LCM), Department of Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Porto, Rua do Dr. Roberto Frias, 4200-465, Porto, Portugal; CAPES Foundation, Ministry of Education of Brazil, Brasília, DF 70040-020, Brazil.', '2 Laboratory of Separation and Reaction Engineering - Laboratory of Catalysis and Materials (LSRE-LCM), Department of Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Porto, Rua do Dr. Roberto Frias, 4200-465, Porto, Portugal.

213,A Novel Method for Optical Distortion Quantification,"Significance:
      
    

    
      Optical distortion is the image degradation of a visual target induced by a transparent material. Current Air Force evaluation of distortion is an entirely qualitative assessment of the acceptability of image distortion. The novel, quantitative technique described here is capable of identifying 0.1% distortion across an array of optical samples. Purpose:
      
    

    
      Optical distortion is the effect by which a transparent object spatially warps the perception of a visual target. All U.S. Air Force visors are required to pass military standards outlined in MIL-DTL-43511D (2006). Although specifications for the optical distortion setup and critical areas of vision are outlined, the evaluation technique is entirely qualitative, with a panel of several human evaluators assessing the distortion acceptability. The evaluation is not explicitly tied to a visual acceptability rating and has variable levels of consistency over time or across evaluators and a fabrication tolerance limit of 3% distortion. Methods:
      
    

    
      The technique proposed in this article is a modification to the recommended optical tester used to analyze distortion patterns. An image-processing algorithm was developed to analyze patterns of Ronchi grid distortion mathematically to provide a quantitative approach that can subsequently be tied to visual metrics. Results:
      
    

    
      This effort developed and refined an algorithm that allowed for a standardized assessment creation of high-resolution distortion maps from digital images. A 1-inch-diameter region imaged through ophthalmic material allowed for two-dimensional median filtering down to 15-pixel areas with enhanced contrast between grid lines leading to possible resolution capabilities of 0.10% distortion. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Quantification of the standard for measuring optical distortion is the initial step toward determining the effects of distortions on human visual performance metrics. The future goal for this effort will focus on obtaining empirical results from human experimental efforts and relating the distortion location and magnitude to effects on visual performance activities.","['1 Department of Biomedical Engineering, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, New Jersey.', '2 711 Human Performance Wing, Airman Systems Directorate, Bioeffects Division, Optical Radiation Bioeffects Branch, San Antonio, Texas.', '3 Engility Corporation, JBSA Fort-Sam, Houston, Texas *christopher.putnam@us.af.mil.']","Katherine M Gerton, Brenda J Novar, William Brockmeier, Christopher Putnam, ",Optometry and vision science : official publication of the American Academy of Optometry,2019 Feb,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30589763

215,Protons versus Photons for Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Liver Decompensation and Overall Survival,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      Ablative radiation therapy is increasingly being used for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) resulting in excellent local control rates; however, patients without evidence of disease progression often die from liver failure. The clinical benefit of proton- over photon-based radiation therapy is unclear. We therefore sought to compare clinical outcomes of proton versus photon ablative radiation therapy in patients with unresectable HCC. Methods and materials:
      
    

    
      This is a single-institution retrospective study of patients treated during 2008 to 2017 with nonmetastatic, unresectable HCC not previously treated with liver-directed radiation therapy and who did not receive further liver-directed radiation therapy within 12 months after completion of index treatment. The primary outcome, overall survival (OS), was assessed using Cox regression. Secondary endpoints included incidence of non-classic radiation-induced liver disease (defined as increase in baseline Child-Pugh score by ≥2 points at 3 months posttreatment), assessed using logistic regression, and locoregional recurrence, assessed using Fine-Gray regression for competing risks. All outcomes were measured from radiation start date. Results:
      
    

    
      The median follow-up was 14 months. Of 133 patients with median age 68 years and 75% male, 49 (37%) were treated with proton radiation therapy. Proton radiation therapy was associated with improved OS (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.47; P = .008; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.27-0.82). The median OS for proton and photon patients was 31 and 14 months, respectively, and the 24-month OS for proton and photon patients was 59.1% and 28.6%, respectively. Proton radiation therapy was also associated with a decreased risk of non-classic radiation-induced liver disease (odds ratio, 0.26; P = .03; 95% CI, 0.08-0.86). Development of nonclassic RILD at 3 months was associated with worse OS (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.83; P < .001; 95% CI, 2.12-6.92). There was no difference in locoregional recurrence, including local failure, between protons and photons. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Proton radiation therapy was associated with improved survival, which may be driven by decreased incidence of posttreatment liver decompensation. Our findings support prospective investigations comparing proton versus photon ablative radiation therapy for HCC.","['1 Harvard Radiation Oncology Program, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts; Department of Radiation Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', '2 Department of Radiation Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', '3 Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', '4 Department of Medical Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', '5 Department of Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', '6 Department of Radiation Oncology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', '7 Department of Radiation Oncology, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', '8 Department of Radiation Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.

216,In Vivo Two-photon Imaging of Cortical Neurons in Neonatal Mice,"Two-photon imaging is a powerful tool for the in vivo analysis of neuronal circuits in the mammalian brain. However, a limited number of in vivo imaging methods exist for examining the brain tissue of live newborn mammals. Herein we summarize a protocol for imaging individual cortical neurons in living neonatal mice. This protocol includes the following two methodologies: (1) the Supernova system for sparse and bright labeling of cortical neurons in the developing brain, and (2) a surgical procedure for the fragile neonatal skull. This protocol allows the observation of temporal changes of individual cortical neurites during neonatal stages with a high signal-to-noise ratio. Labeled cell-specific gene silencing and knockout can also be achieved by combining the Supernova with RNA interference and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing systems. This protocol can, thus, be used for analyzing the developmental dynamics of cortical neurons, molecular mechanisms that control the neuronal dynamics, and changes in neuronal dynamics in disease models.","['1 International Research Center for Medical Sciences (IRCMS), Kumamoto University; Division of Neurogenetics, National Institute of Genetics; Department of Genetics, SOKENDAI (The Graduate University for Advanced Studies); hmizuno@kumamoto-u.ac.jp.', '2 Division of Neurogenetics, National Institute of Genetics; Department of Genetics, SOKENDAI (The Graduate University for Advanced Studies).']","Hidenobu Mizuno, Shingo Nakazawa, Takuji Iwasato, ",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30394388
217,In Vivo Functional Imaging of Retinal Neurons Using Red and Green Fluorescent Calcium Indicators,"Adaptive optics retinal imaging of fluorescent calcium indicators is a minimally invasive method used to study retinal physiology over extended periods of time. It has potential for discovering novel retinal circuits, tracking retinal function in animal models of retinal disease, and assessing vision restoration therapy. We previously demonstrated functional adaptive optics imaging of retinal neurons in the living eye using green fluorescent calcium indicators; however, the use of green fluorescent indicators presents challenges that stem from the fact that they are excited by short-wavelength light. Using red fluorescent calcium indicators such as jRGECO1a, which is excited with longer-wavelength light (~560 nm), makes imaging approximately five times safer than using short-wavelength light (~500 nm) used to excite green fluorescent calcium indicators such as GCaMP6s. Red fluorescent indicators also provide alternative wavelength imaging regimes to overcome cross talk with the sensitivities of intrinsic photoreceptors and blue light-activated channelrhodopsins. Here we evaluate jRGECO1a for in vivo functional adaptive optics imaging of retinal neurons using single-photon excitation in mice. We find that jRGECO1a provides similar fidelity as the established green indicator GCaMP6s.","['1 Center for Visual Science, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA.', '2 Flaum Eye Institute, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA.', '3 Department of Biomedical Sciences, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong SAR, China.', '4 Departments of Genetics and Ophthalmology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', '5 Institute of Optics, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA.', '6 Center for Visual Science, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA. billm@cvs.rochester.edu.']","Soon K Cheong, Wenjun Xiong, Jennifer M Strazzeri, Constance L Cepko, David R Williams, William H Merigan, ",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,2018,Adaptive optics; Calcium indicator; Ganglion cells; Retinal imaging; jRGECO1a.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29721937

219,Ruling engines and diffraction gratings before Rowland: the work of Lewis Rutherfurd and William Rogers,"Diffraction gratings are famously associated with Henry Rowland of Johns Hopkins University but there were precursors. Although gratings were first made and used in Europe, reliable machines for ruling gratings were developed in the USA, and two men, Lewis Rutherfurd and William Rogers, tackled the problem before Rowland. Rutherfurd, a wealthy independent astronomer, designed and built the first screw-operated engine for ruling diffraction gratings, the fore-runner of almost all subsequent ruling engines. With it he and his assistant D. C. Chapman ruled many gratings which he generously distributed to practising scientists, thereby materially advancing the science of spectroscopy. Rogers was a Harvard astronomer who developed an interest in the ruling of fine lines on glass that led him to construct a ruling engine with which he investigated the causes of the errors in the rulings he had examined. He continued to seek improvements with a second engine designed for ruling diffraction gratings. He ceased developing this engine when Rowland's excellent gratings began to be available, concentrating instead on related problems to which he could apply the knowledge and skills he had gained, but his investigations assisted Rowland and other later ruling engine builders. This paper brings together what is known about the ruling engines of Rutherfurd and Rogers, their development, the gratings they produced, their quality and the work that was done with them, and assesses and compares their achievements and the impacts of the work of these two men.","['1 a Formerly of the Science Museum , London , UK.']","C N Brown, ",Annals of science,2018 Oct,Daniel Chapman; Lewis Rutherfurd; Ruling engines; William Rogers; diffraction gratings.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30481124
220,Overcoming the challenges of high-energy X-ray ptychography,"X-ray ptychography is a coherent diffraction imaging technique with a high resolving power and excellent quantitative capabilities. Although very popular in synchrotron facilities nowadays, its implementation with X-ray energies above 15 keV is very rare due to the challenges imposed by the high energies. Here, the implementation of high-energy X-ray ptychography at 17 and 33.6 keV is demonstrated and solutions to overcome the important challenges are provided. Among the particular aspects addressed are the use of an efficient high-energy detector, a long synchrotron beamline for the high degree of spatial coherence, a beam with 1% monochromaticity providing high flux, and efficient multilayer coated Kirkpatrick-Baez X-ray optics to shape the beam. The constraints imposed by the large energy bandwidth are carefully analyzed, as well as the requirements to sample correctly the high-energy diffraction patterns with small speckle size. In this context, optimized scanning trajectories allow the total acquisition time to be reduced by up to 35%. The paper explores these innovative solutions at the ID16A nano-imaging beamline by ptychographic imaging of a 200 nm-thick gold lithography sample.","['1 European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, 38000 Grenoble, France.']","Julio Cesar da Silva, Cyril Guilloud, Olivier Hignette, Christophe Jarnias, Cyril Ponchut, Marie Ruat, Jean Claude Labiche, Alexandra Pacureanu, Yang Yang, Murielle Salome, Sylvain Bohic, Peter Cloetens, ",Journal of synchrotron radiation,2019,KB mirrors; X-ray ptychography; coherence; coherent X-ray diffraction; high-energy X-rays; nano-imaging.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31490167

Benefits include longer survey durations, improved mission safety, mission repeatability, and reduced operational costs. We review the present status of unmanned vehicles suitable for marine animal monitoring conducted in relation to industrial offshore activities, highlighting which systems are suitable for three main monitoring types: population, mitigation, and focal animal monitoring. We describe the technical requirements for each of these monitoring types and discuss the operational aspects. The selection of a specific sensor/platform combination depends critically on the target species and its behaviour. The technical specifications of unmanned platforms and sensors also need to be selected based on the surrounding conditions of a particular offshore project, such as the area of interest, the survey requirements and operational constraints.","['1 SMRU Consulting, New Technology Centre, North Haugh, St Andrews, Fife KY16 9SR, UK.

This technique achieves extremely high time resolution and near-ideal detection efficiency. Modern TCSPC is multi-dimensional, i.e., in addition to the photon arrival time relative to the excitation pulse, spatial coordinates within the image area, wavelength, time from the start of the experiment, and many other parameters are determined for each photon. Hence, the multi-dimensional TCSPC allows generation of photon distributions over these parameters.

223,A new Monte Carlo model of a Cyberknife ® system for the precise determination of out-of-field doses,"In a previous work, a PENELOPE Monte Carlo model of a Cyberknife system equipped with fixed collimator was developed and validated for in-field dose evaluation. The aim of this work is to extend it to evaluate peripheral doses and to determine the precision of the treatment planning system (TPS) Multiplan in evaluating the off-axis doses. The Cyberknife® head model was completed with surrounding components based on manufacturer drawings. The contribution of the different head parts on the out-of-field dose was studied. To model the attenuation and the modification of particle energy caused by components not modelled, the photon transport was modified in one of the added components. The model was iteratively adjusted to fit dose profiles measured with EBT3 films and an ionization chamber for several collimator sizes. Finally, dose profiles were calculated using the two Multiplan TPS algorithms and were compared to our simulations. The contributions to out-of-field dose were identified as scattered radiation from the phantom and head leakage and scatter originating at the secondary collimator level. Particle transport in the additional pieces was modified to model this radiation. The maximum differences between simulated and measured doses are of 20.4%. Regarding the detector responses away from axis, EBT3 films and the Farmer chamber give similar response (less than 20% difference). The TPS Monte Carlo algorithm underestimates the doses away from axis more importantly for the smaller field sizes (up to 98%). Besides, RayTracing simplifies peripheral dose to a constant value with no inclusion of particle transport. A Monte Carlo model of a Cyberknife system for the determination of out-of-field doses up to 14 cm off-axis was successfully developed and validated for different depths and field sizes in comparison with measurements. This study also confirms that TPS algorithms do not model peripheral dose properly.","['1 Institut de Radioprotection et de Sûreté Nucléaire (IRSN), Service de Recherche en Dosimétrie, Laboratoire de Dosimétrie des Rayonnements Ionisants, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.

224,Investigation of the use of external aluminium targets for portal imaging in a medical accelerator using Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation,"Objective:
      
    

    
      To install a low-Z target on the wedge tray mount of a medical linear accelerator to create a new image beam and to confirm image contrast enhancement. Methods:
      
    

    
      Experimental low-energy photon beams were produced with the linac running in the 6 MeV electron mode and with a low-Z target installed on the wedge tray mount [denoted 6 MeV (low-Z target)]. Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation was performed to analyse the energy spectrum and image contrast of a 6 MeV (low-Z target) beam. This study modelled the 6 MeV (low-Z target) beam and the 6 MV (megavoltage) radiotherapy photon beam and verified model validity by measurement. In addition, a contrast phantom was modelled to quantitatively compare the image contrasts of the 6 MeV (low-Z target) beam and the 6 MV radiotherapy photon beam. A low-Z target was fabricated to generate low-energy photons (25-150 keV) from incident electrons, and a portal image of the Alderson RANDO phantom was acquired using a clinical linear accelerator for qualitative analysis. Results:
      
    

    
      The measured and calculated percentage depth dose of the 6 MV photon and 6 MeV (Al) beams were consistent within 1.5 and 1.6%, respectively, and calculated lateral profiles of the 6 MV photon beam and the 6 MeV (Al) beam were consistent with the measured results within 1.5 and 1.9%, respectively. Although low-energy photons (25-150 keV) of the 6 MV photon beam were only 0.3%, the Be, C, and Al low-Z targets, but not the Ti target, generated 34.4 to 38.5% low-energy photons. In 5 to 20 cm water phantoms, contrast of the 6 MeV (Al) beam was approximately 1.16 times greater than that of the 6 MV beam. The contrasts of 6 MeV (Al) and 6 MV photon beams in the 20 cm water phantom were ~34% lower than those in the 5 cm water phantom. 6 MeV (Al)/CR (computed radiography) images of the human body phantom were more vivid and detailed than 6 MV/EPID (electronic portal imaging device) and 6 MeV (Al)/EPID images. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The experimental beam with a low-Z target, which was simply installed on the wedge tray mount of the radiotherapy linear accelerator, generated significantly more low-energy photons than the 6 MV radiotherapy photon beam, and provided better quality portal images. Advances in knowledge: This study shows that, unlike the existing low-Z beam studies, a low-Z target can be installed outside the head of a linear accelerator to improve portal image quality.","['1 1 Department of Radiation Oncology, Daegu Fatima Hospital , Daegu , South Korea.', '2 2 Department of Radiation Oncology, Semyung Christianity Hospital , Pohang , South Korea.', '3 3 Department of Radiation Oncology, Dongguk University Gyeongju Hospital , Gyeongju , South Korea.', '4 4 Department of Radiation Oncology, Keimyung University College of Medicine , Daegu , South Korea.']","Hyungdong Kim, Byungyong Kim, Jonggeun Baek, Youngkee Oh, Sangmo Yun, Hyunsoo Jang, ",The British journal of radiology,2018 Apr,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29338304

      The aim of this work was to provide a novel description of how the radiotherapy community configures treatment planning system (TPS) radiation beam models for clinically used treatment machines. Here we describe the results of a survey of self-reported TPS beam modeling parameter values across different C-arm linear accelerators, beam energies, and multileaf collimator (MLC) configurations. Acquisition and validation methods:
      
    

    
      Beam modeling data were acquired via electronic survey implemented through the Imaging and Radiation Oncology Core (IROC) Houston Quality Assurance Center's online facility questionnaire. The survey was open to participation from January 2018 through January 2019 for all institutions monitored by IROC. After quality control, 2818 beam models were collected from 642 institutions. This survey, designed for Eclipse, Pinnacle, and RayStation, instructed physicists to report parameter values used to model the radiation source and MLC for each treatment machine and beam energy used clinically for intensity-modulated radiation therapy. Parameters collected included the effective source/spot size, MLC transmission, dosimetric leaf gap, tongue and groove effect, and other nondosimetric parameters specific to each TPS. To facilitate survey participation, instructions were provided on how to identify requested beam modeling parameters within each TPS environment. Data format and usage notes:
      
    

    
      Numeric values of the beam modeling parameters are compiled and tabulated according to TPS and calculation algorithm, linear accelerator model class, beam energy, and MLC configuration. Values are also presented as distributions, ranging from the 2.5th to the 97.5th percentile. Potential applications:

227,Quantification of Acute Skin Toxicities in Patients With Breast Cancer Undergoing Adjuvant Proton versus Photon Radiation Therapy: A Single Institutional Experience,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      Acute skin toxicity in the form of radiation dermatitis (RD) or skin hyperpigmentation (SH) is a common problem experienced by patients undergoing breast irradiation. Proton radiation has been thought to deliver higher doses to skin compared with photon radiation because of differences in the physical properties between photons and protons; however, limited literature exists directly comparing toxicity outcomes. Methods and materials:
      
    

    
      The highest recorded grades of acute RD and SH were analyzed in 86 patients undergoing adjuvant radiation therapy to the breast with or without regional lymph nodes after lumpectomy (breast-conserving surgery) or mastectomy with either proton pencil-beam scanning (n = 39) or photon (n = 47) radiation therapy within a single institution to analyze differences in severity of acute skin reactions. For 34 of 47 photon and 33 of 39 proton patients, a ""skin"" contour was retroactively created in our treatment planning systems, and multiple dosimetric parameters were calculated to quantify objective radiation doses received by skin. Results:
      
    

    
      On χ2 analysis, the highest reported grade of RD was significantly higher in women undergoing proton radiation compared with photon radiation; grade ≥2 RD was present in 69.2% versus 29.8% of patients receiving proton and photon therapy, respectively (P = .002). Rates of grade 3 RD were 5.1% versus 4.3% for proton versus photon radiation, respectively (P = .848). Overall, there were no significant differences in rates of SH between modalities. There were no grade 4 to 5 toxicities in either cohort. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      In a comparison with patients receiving photon radiation, a significantly higher rate of grade ≥2 RD was observed in patients undergoing proton radiation, with very low rates of grade 3 toxicity in both groups. Rates of SH did not differ significantly between modalities. Women should be counseled regarding the possibility of increased grade 2 toxicities, although this might present a dosimetric advantage for physicians when treating patients in the postmastectomy setting or when skin was involved on presentation.","['1 Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Maryland Medical Center, Baltimore, MD.

228,"Biomimetic design of iridescent insect cuticles with tailored, self-organized cholesteric patterns","Replicating biological patterns is promising for designing materials with multifaceted properties. Twisted cholesteric liquid crystal patterns are found in the iridescent tessellated cuticles of many insects and a few fruits. Their accurate replication is extremely difficult since discontinuous patterns and colors must coexist in a single layer without discontinuity of the structures. Here, a solution is demonstrated by addressing striped insect cuticles with a complex twisted organization. Geometric constraints are met by controlling the thermal diffusion in a cholesteric oligomer bilayer subjected to local changes in the molecular anchoring conditions. A multicriterion comparison reveals a very high level of biomimicry. Proof-of-concept prototypes of anti-counterfeiting tags are presented. The present design involves an economy of resources and a high versatility of chiral patterns unreached by the current manufacturing techniques such as metallic layer vacuum deposition, template embossing and various forms of lithography which are limited and often prohibitively expensive.","[""1 Centre d'Elaboration de Matériaux et d'Etudes Structurales, CEMES, CNRS, Toulouse, France."", '2 Centre de Biologie Intégrative, CBI, Microscopie Electronique Intégrative, METi, CNRS, University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', ""3 Centre d'Elaboration de Matériaux et d'Etudes Structurales, CEMES, CNRS, Toulouse, France. mitov@cemes.fr.""]","Adriana Scarangella, Vanessa Soldan, Michel Mitov, ",Nature communications,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32796840

230,High-density microfibers as a potential optical interface to reach deep brain regions,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Optical techniques for recording and manipulating neural activity have traditionally been constrained to superficial brain regions due to light scattering. New techniques are needed to extend optical access to large 3D volumes in deep brain areas, while retaining local connectivity. Approach:
      
    

    
      We have developed a method to implant bundles of hundreds or thousands of optical microfibers, each with a diameter of 8 μm. During insertion, each fiber moves independently, following a path of least resistance. The fibers achieve near total internal reflection, enabling optically interfacing with the tissue near each fiber aperture. Main results:
      
    

    
      At a depth of 3 mm, histology shows fibers consistently splay over 1 mm in diameter throughout the target region. Immunohistochemical staining after chronic implants reveals neurons in close proximity to the fiber tips. Models of photon fluence indicate that fibers can be used as a stimulation light source to precisely activate distinct patterns of neurons by illuminating a subset of fibers in the bundle. By recording fluorescent beads diffusing in water, we demonstrate the recording capability of the fibers. Significance:
      
    

    
      Our histology, modeling and fluorescent bead recordings suggest that the optical microfibers may provide a minimally invasive, stable, bidirectional interface for recording or stimulating genetic probes in deep brain regions-a hyper-localized form of fiber photometry.","['1 Graduate Program in Neuroscience, Boston University, Boston, MA 02215, United States of America.']","L Nathan Perkins, Dawit Semu, Jun Shen, David A Boas, Timothy J Gardner, ",Journal of neural engineering,2018 Dec,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30127101

232,Low-dose material-specific radiography using monoenergetic photons,"Cargo containers constitute the most critical component of global trade: 108 million containers represent the movement of about 95% of the world's manufactured goods. The steady increase in cargo container shipments has had a profound effect on world security: the threat associated with smuggling of shielded special nuclear material is elevated every year. Containers reaching the borders of the U.S. are currently not radiographically inspected due to time and dose considerations stemming from the use of bremsstrahlung beams for imaging. Bremsstrahlung spectra are low-energy peaked, resulting in low penetration values, especially through dense cargoes. The use of monoenergetic radiography beams could alleviate many of these problems due to higher energy and low background continuum. Using Monte Carlo simulations of a realistic imaging scenario with support from previous experimental measurements, we demonstrate how the use of monoenergetic photon beams in radiography can simultaneously reduce the radiation dose imparted to the cargo and any potential stowaways while increasing image quality. Dual-energy methods are leveraged to calculate material atomic number. Image quality is evaluated by measuring the noise standard deviation, contrast-to-noise ratio, and the pixel error as the dose is decreased.","['1 Nuclear and Radiological Engineering and Medical Physics Programs, G.

233,Attosecond delay in the molecular photoionization of asymmetric molecules,"We report theoretical calculations of the delay in photoemission from CO with particular emphasis on the role of the ultrafast electronic bound dynamics. We study the delays in photoionization in the HOMO and HOMO-1 orbitals of the CO molecule by looking into the stereo Wigner time delay technique. That compares the delay in photoemission from electrons emitted to the left and right to extract structural and dynamical information of the ionization process. For this we apply two techniques: The attosecond streak camera and the time of flight technique. Although they should provide the same results we have found large discrepancies of up to 36 in the case of HOMO, while for the HOMO-1 we obtain the same results with the two techniques. We have found that the large time delays observed in the HOMO orbital with the streaking technique are a consequence of the resonant transition triggered by the streaking field. This resonant transition produces a bound electron wavepacket that modifies the measurements of delay in photoionization. As a result of this observation, our technique allows us to reconstruct the bound wavepacket dynamics induced by the streaking field. By measuring the expected value of the electron momentum along the polarization direction after the streaking field has finished, we can recover the relative phase between the complex amplitudes of the HOMO and LUMO orbitals. These theoretical calculations pave the way for the measurement of ultrafast bound-bound electron transitionsand its crucial role for the delay in photoemission observation.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Alexis Chacón, Camilo Ruiz, ",Optics express,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29475304

236,A compact holographic projector module for high-resolution 3D multi-site two-photon photostimulation,"Patterned two-photon (2P) photolysis via holographic illumination is a powerful method to investigate neuronal function because of its capability to emulate multiple synaptic inputs in three dimensions (3D) simultaneously. However, like any optical system, holographic projectors have a finite space-bandwidth product that restricts the spatial range of patterned illumination or field-of-view (FOV) for a desired resolution. Such trade-off between holographic FOV and resolution restricts the coverage within a limited domain of the neuron's dendritic tree to perform highly resolved patterned 2P photolysis on individual spines. Here, we integrate a holographic projector into a commercial 2P galvanometer-based 2D scanning microscope with an uncaging unit and extend the accessible holographic FOV by using the galvanometer scanning mirrors to reposition the holographic FOV arbitrarily across the imaging FOV. The projector system utilizes the microscope's built-in imaging functions. Stimulation positions can be selected from within an acquired 3D image stack (the volume-of-interest, VOI) and the holographic projector then generates 3D illumination patterns with multiple uncaging foci. The imaging FOV of our system is 800×800 μm2 within which a holographic VOI of 70×70×70 μm3 can be chosen at arbitrary positions and also moved during experiments without moving the sample. We describe the design and alignment protocol as well as the custom software plugin that controls the 3D positioning of stimulation sites. We demonstrate the neurobiological application of the system by simultaneously uncaging glutamate at multiple spines within dendritic domains and consequently observing summation of postsynaptic potentials at the soma, eventually resulting in action potentials. At the same time, it is possible to perform two-photon Ca2+ imaging in 2D in the dendrite and thus to monitor synaptic Ca2+ entry in selected spines and also local regenerative events such as dendritic action potentials.","['1 Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London, South Kensington, SW7 2AZ London, United Kingdom.', '2 Neurophysiology, Institute of Zoology, Universität Regensburg, 93040 Regensburg, Germany.', '3 Eccles Institute of Neuroscience, John Curtin School of Medical Research, The Australian National University, Canberra, 0200 ACT, Australia.']","Mary Ann Go, Max Mueller, Michael Lawrence Castañares, Veronica Egger, Vincent R Daria, ",PloS one,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30689635
237,The effect of the flattening filter on photoneutron production at 10 MV in the Varian TrueBeam linear accelerator,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      Neutrons are an unavoidable by-product of high-energy radiation therapy treatments that deliver unwanted nontarget dose to patients. Use of flattening-filter-free (FFF) photon beams has been shown to significantly reduce photoneutron production per monitor unit (MU) of dose delivered. The purpose of this investigation was to characterize the photoneutron production of the 10 MV and 10 MV FFF beams of the Varian TrueBeamTM linear accelerator. Methods:
      
    

    
      Neutron fluence spectra were measured using a Nested Neutron SpectrometerTM (NNS, Detec Inc., Gatineau, Canada). The ratios of neutron fluence and ambient dose equivalent for the 10 MV FFF beam relative to the 10 MV beam, dubbed FF-ratios (FFF/FF), were used to characterize the difference between the two beams. FF-ratios were compared under the following three conditions (a) per MU, at various locations in the treatment room, (b) per MU, with the linac jaws opened and closed, and (c) per electron striking the bremsstrahlung target, as opposed to per MU, at one location with the jaws closed. Results:
      
    

    
      On average, the neutron fluence for the 10 MV FFF beam was 37% lower per MU than the 10 MV beam (FF-ratio = 0.63). The FF-ratio in neutron fluence and ambient dose equivalent did not vary by much between different locations within the treatment room. However, the FF-ratio in neutron ambient dose equivalent was reduced significantly when the linac jaws were opened compared to closed, which implies that the jaws contribute more to the photoneutron spectrum of the 10 MV FFF beam than to the 10 MV beam. Finally, it was found that the 10 MV FFF beam produces more photoneutrons per electron striking the bremsstrahlung target than the 10 MV beam (FF-ratio = 2.56). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The photoneutron fluence per MU produced by the 10 MV FFF beam is 37% lower than the 10 MV beam of a Varian TrueBeam linac. Accordingly, a reduction in neutron dose received by patients is achieved through use of the unflattened beam, provided that treatment plans for each beam require approximately the same number of MU. It was found to be instructive to compare the photoneutron yield per source electron between the two beams as it helped provide an understanding of the physics underlying photoneutron production in both beams.","['1 Medical Physics Unit, McGill University, Montreal, QC, H4A3J1, Canada.', '2 Department of Radiation Oncology, Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, QC, H3T1E2, Canada.']","Logan Montgomery, Michael Evans, Liheng Liang, Robert Maglieri, John Kildea, ",Medical physics,2018 Oct,10 MV; MLEM; TrueBeam; flattening filter-free; neutron.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30141186

This study investigates the photon energies and angles of incidence for which the estimation of ERPG with the personal dose equivalents measured over and under the RPG (Ho and Hu) becomes more challenging. The energy and angular dependences of ERPG, Ho and Hu were Monte Carlo calculated for photon exposures. The personal dosimeter of SCK · CEN was modeled and used to determine Ho and Hu. Different SD and DD algorithms were tested and critical exposure conditions were identified. Moreover, the influence of calibration methods was investigated for the SCK · CEN dosimeter when worn over RPG. We found that the accuracy with which ERPG is calculated using SD and DD is strongly dependent on the energy and angle of incidence of photons. Also, the energy of the photon beam used to calibrate the Ho dosimeter can bias the estimation of ERPG.","['1 Belgian Nuclear Research Centre (SCK · CEN), Boeretang 200, 2400 Mol, Belgium.']","C Saldarriaga Vargas, L Struelens, F Vanhavere, ",Radiation protection dosimetry,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28985413

Dosimetry analysis of healthy organs under real conditions is not feasible. Therefore, computational simulations are used to aid in dose verification in organs of patients submitted to radiotherapy. The goal of this study was to calculate the equivalent dose, due to photons, in the surrounding of healthy organs of patients submitted to radiotherapy for lung cancer, through computational modeling. The simulation was performed using the MCNPX code (MNCPX, 2006), Rex and Regina phantoms (ICRP 110, 2009), radiotherapy room, Siemens Oncor Expression accelerator operating at 6 MV and treatment protocol adopted at the INCA (National Cancer Institute - Brazil). The results obtained, considering the dose due to photons for both phantoms indicate that organs located inside the thoracic cavity received higher dose, being the bronchi, heart and esophagus more affected, due to their anatomical positioning. Clinical data describe the development of bronchiolitis, esophagitis and cardiomyopathies with decreased cardiopulmonary function as one of the major effects of lung cancer treatment. In the Regina phantom, the second largest dose was in the region of the breasts with 615.73 mSv/Gy, while in the Rex the dose was 514.06 mSv/Gy, event related to the difference of anatomical structure of the organ.

245,A case report of total skin photon radiation therapy for cutaneous epitheliotropic lymphoma in a dog,"Background:
      
    

    
      Total skin electron beam radiation therapy (TSEBT) is an effective treatment for primary diffuse cutaneous lymphomas in humans. While several techniques exist, they all require significant commitment of staff time and resources. In veterinary medicine, canine-specific techniques and strategies have been adapted and delivered but deemed not ""realistically"" clinically implementable given the time commitment of over 2.5 h plus per fraction or have been relegated to palliative intent. Leveraging these technologies of helical tomotherapy and 3D printing, we developed and clinically implemented a radiotherapeutic treatment strategy for the management of medically refractory diffuse cutaneous lymphoma in the dog. Case presentation:
      
    

    
      A 13.5-year-old female spayed Bichon Frise presented to the Oncology service at Texas A&M University, College of Veterinary Medicine due to the progression of diffuse cutaneous epitheliotropic lymphoma (CEL) that had failed medical management. Twenty-seven gray were delivered to the patient with a treatment time requirement under 40 min including real time monitoring of anesthesia during setup and treatment. A partial response was noticeable after four fractions and the tumor completely regressed progressively over the entire treated area by the end of therapy. A grade 1 lethargy, fatigue, weight loss, and oral mucositis and grade 2 alopecia, nail/claw changes, pruritus, scaling, anorexia, and diarrhea were noted during treatment. Additionally, a grade 3 thrombocytopenia developed after fraction eight requiring a treatment interruption of 6 weeks and prescription modification prior to treatment continuation and completion. From the beginning of total skin photon radiation therapy (TSPT) treatment until the time of the patient was euthanized unrelated to cutaneous epitheliotropic lymphoma (123 days), only one new lesion on the head was identified and confirmed by histopathology within the treated fields. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The proposed technique is an acceptable alternative to TSEBT that is actually clinically implementable within a palliative or definitive setting and clinical constraints, however further testing and refinement is needed to reduce hematological complications and to confirm and expand on preliminary findings.","['1 Department of Small Animal Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences, Texas A&M University, 4474 TAMU, College Station, TX, 77843-4474, USA. mdeveau@cvm.tamu.edu.', '2 Mission Veterinary Specialty and Emergency, San Antonio, TX, 78249, USA.', '3 Department of Small Animal Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences, Texas A&M University, 4474 TAMU, College Station, TX, 77843-4474, USA.']","Michael A Deveau, Megan Sutton, Courtney Baetge, Alison B Diesel, ",BMC veterinary research,2019,Cutaneous lymphoma; Dogs; Radiation; Total skin.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31706321

The present article will consider a wide range of factors that can influence the perceptual identification of glass, including the structural complexity of an object, whether it is hollow or solid, and the pattern of illumination. Several illumination techniques used in the field of photography are described, and examples are provided to show how they interact with structural complexity. A single psychophysical experiment is reported to evaluate the perceptions of naïve observers using a novel categorization task designed to assess potential confusions among multiple material categories. Finally, the paper will enumerate a number of specific image features that are potentially diagnostic for the identification of glass, and it will evaluate their relative importance for human perception.","['1 Department of Psychology, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', '2 Psychological Sciences, Western Kentucky University, Bowling Green, KY, USA.']","James T Todd, J Farley Norman, ",Journal of vision,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31009527
247,CORRECTION FACTORS FOR ATTENUATION AND SCATTERING OF THE WALL OF A CYLINDRICAL IONIZATION CHAMBER IN THE 6-7 MeV HIGH-ENERGY PHOTON REFERENCE FIELD,In high-energy photon reference fields the value of the air kerma rate is determined by using ionization chambers (ICs). From the charge collected inside the IC the dose can be calculated using a set of calibration and correction factors according to ISO 4037-2. A crucial parameter is the correction for the attenuation and scattering of the primary radiation due to the chamber wall. This parameter can be determined using Monte Carlo calculations. The evaluation of the factor was performed for a commercially available IC of the type Victoreen 550-3 under different build-up conditions.

      The authors evaluated adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (AO-SLO) in a simulated real-life clinical setting to identify factors that impact its reliability in this setting. Patients and methods:
      
    

    
      For this prospective study, macular cones were imaged in five healthy eyes using an AO-SLO prototype machine. Multilevel mixed-effect regression was used to compare the cone densities across different analysis parameters. Intergrader, intragrader, interphotographer, and intersession reliabilities were determined with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Results:
      
    

    
      Cone densities in the largest measurement window size, 150 μm × 150 μm, were most consistent. Image quality strongly impacted cone analysis. Intragrader and intergrader ICCs were 0.99 and 0.98, respectively. Intersession and interphotographer reliability both had an ICC of 0.72. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Larger measurement window sizes and higher image quality improve the reliability of cone density measurement. Although there were excellent intergrader and intragrader reliabilities, intersession and interphotographer reliabilities were not as robust.

250,Microscale and Nanoscale Electrophotonic Diagnostic Devices,"Detecting and identifying infectious agents and potential pathogens in complex environments and characterizing their mode of action is a critical need. Traditional diagnostics have targeted a single characteristic (e.g., spectral response, surface receptor, mass, intrinsic conductivity, etc.). However, advances in detection technologies have identified emerging approaches in which multiple modes of action are combined to obtain enhanced performance characteristics. Particularly appealing in this regard, electrophotonic devices capable of coupling light to electron translocation have experienced rapid recent growth and offer significant advantages for diagnostics. In this review, we explore three specific promising approaches that combine electronics and photonics: (1) assays based on closed bipolar electrochemistry coupling electron transfer to color or fluorescence, (2) sensors based on localized surface plasmon resonances, and (3) emerging nanophotonics approaches, such as those based on zero-mode waveguides and metamaterials.","['1 Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana 46556.', '2 Advanced Light Source, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, California 94720.', '3 Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana 46556.']","Kaiyu Fu, Wei Xu, Jiayun Hu, Arielle Lopez, Paul W Bohn, ",Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in medicine,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30104197

ISETBio software integrates such computations and data into an open-source software package. The initial ISETBio implementations modeled image formation (physiological optics) for planar or distant scenes. The ISET3d software described here extends that implementation, simulating image formation for three-dimensional scenes. The software system relies on a quantitative computer graphics program that ray traces the scene radiance through the physiological optics to the retinal irradiance. We describe and validate the implementation for several model eyes. Then, we use the software to quantify the impact of several physiological optics parameters on three-dimensional image formation. ISET3d is integrated with ISETBio, making it straightforward to convert the retinal irradiance into cone excitations. These methods help the user compute the predictions of optics models for a wide range of spatially rich three-dimensional scenes. They can also be used to evaluate the impact of nearby visual occlusion, the information available to binocular vision, or the retinal images expected from near-field and augmented reality displays.","['1 Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, USA.', '2 Facebook Reality Labs, Redmond, WA, USA.', '3 Department of Psychology, University of Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania, PA, USA.', '4 Department of Psychology, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, USA.']","Trisha Lian, Kevin J MacKenzie, David H Brainard, Nicolas P Cottaris, Brian A Wandell, ",Journal of vision,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31658357

Their requirement of data suitable for the different clinical options available, regarding treatment units and dosimetry equipment, has generated a considerable amount of research by the scientific community during the last decade. The multiple publications in the field have led not only to the availability of new invaluable data, but have also contributed substantially to an improved understanding of the physics of their dosimetry.

253,Pushing Cherenkov PET with BGO via coincidence time resolution classification and correction,"Bismuth germanate (BGO) shows good properties for positron emission tomography (PET) applications, but was substituted by the development of faster crystals like lutetium oxyorthosilicate (LSO) for time-of-flight PET (TOF-PET). Recent improvements in silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) and fast readout electronics make it possible to access the Cherenkov photon signal produced upon 511 keV interaction, which makes BGO a cost-effective candidate for TOF-PET. Tails in the time-delay distribution, however, remain a challenge. These are mainly caused by the high statistical fluctuation on the Cherenkov photons detected. To select fast events with a high detected Cherenkov photon number, the signal rise time of the SiPM was used for discrimination. The charge, time delay and signal rise time was measured for two different lengths of BGO crystals coupled to FBK NUV-HD SiPMs and high frequency readout in a coincidence time resolution setup. The recorded events were divided into 5 × 5 categories based on the signal rise time, and time resolutions of 200 ± 3 ps for 2 × 2 × 20 mm3 and 117 ± 3 ps for 2 × 2 × 3 mm3 were measured for the fastest 20% of the events (4% in coincidence). These good timing events can provide additional information for the image reconstruction in order to increase the SNR significantly, without spoiling the detector sensitivity. Putting all photopeak events together and correcting for the time bias introduced by different numbers of Cherenkov photons detected, time resolutions of 259 ± 3 ps for 20 mm long and 151 ± 3 ps for 3 mm long crystals were measured. For a small fraction of events sub-100 ps coincidence time resolution with BGO was reached for a 3 mm short pixel.","['1 CERN, Esplanade des Particules 1, 1211 Meyrin, Switzerland.

254,"Characterization of a Time-Resolved Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy Prototype Using Low-Cost, Compact Single Photon Avalanche Detectors for Tissue Optics Applications","Time-resolved diffuse optical spectroscopy (TR-DOS) is an increasingly used method to determine the optical properties of diffusive media, particularly for medical applications including functional brain, breast and muscle measurements. For medical imaging applications, important features of new generation TR-DOS systems are low-cost, small size and efficient inverse modeling. To address the issues of low-cost, compact size and high integration capabilities, we have developed free-running (FR) single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) using 130 nm silicon complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology and used it in a TR-DOS prototype. This prototype was validated using assessments from two known protocols for evaluating TR-DOS systems for tissue optics applications. Following the basic instrumental performance protocol, our prototype had sub-nanosecond total instrument response function and low differential non-linearity of a few percent. Also, using light with optical power lower than the maximum permissible exposure for human skin, this prototype can acquire raw data in reflectance geometry for phantoms with optical properties similar to human tissues. Following the MEDPHOT protocol, the absolute values of the optical properties for several homogeneous phantoms were retrieved with good accuracy and linearity using a best-fitting model based on the Levenberg-Marquardt method. Overall, the results of this study show that our silicon CMOS-based SPAD detectors can be used to build a multichannel TR-DOS prototype. Also, real-time functional monitoring of human tissue such as muscles, breasts and newborn heads will be possible by integrating this detector with a time-to-digital converter (TDC).","['1 School of Biomedical Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L8, Canada. alayedms@mcmaster.ca.', '2 National Nanotechnology Center, King Abdul Aziz City for Science and Technology (KACST), Riyadh 11442, Saudi Arabia. alayedms@mcmaster.ca.', '3 Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L8, Canada. palubid@mcmaster.ca.', '4 School of Biomedical Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L8, Canada. jamal@mcmaster.ca.', '5 Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L8, Canada. jamal@mcmaster.ca.']","Mrwan Alayed, Darek P Palubiak, M Jamal Deen, ","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2018,diffuse optical spectroscopy; silicon photodetectors; single-photon avalanche diode; time-correlated single-photon counting; time-resolved spectroscopy; tissue optics.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30380688

256,Radiation tolerance of the optic pathway in patients treated with proton and photon radiotherapy,"Introduction:
      
    

    
      Radiation-induced optic neuropathy (RION) is a complication of radiation therapy (RT) that causes blindness. We aimed to define the tolerance of the anterior optic pathway to fractionated RT and identify risk factors for RION. Materials/methods:
      
    

    
      Patients with chordoma or chondrosarcoma of the skull base treated with proton and photon therapy between 1983 and 2013, who received a minimum of 30 Gy (relative biologic effectiveness [RBE]) to the anterior optic pathway were assessed. Optic neuropathy with radiographic correlation occurring ≥6 months after completion of RT in the absence of tumor recurrence or other probable cause was diagnosed as RION. Results:
      
    

    
      Of 514 patients, 17 developed RION. With median follow-up of 4.8 years, cumulative incidence of RION was 1% among patients receiving <59 Gy (RBE) and 5.8% among patients receiving ≥60 Gy (RBE) to the optic pathway. Higher maximum point dose to the optic pathway (subhazard ratio [SHR] = 1.2, 95% CI 1.05-1.2, p = 0.001), older age (SHR = 1.1, 95% CI 1.02-1.08, p < 0.0005), and female sex (SHR = 16.3, 95% CI 2.2-122.4, p = 0.007) were statistically significant risk factors for RION in multivariate analysis. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      In our study cohort, rates of RION were very low with conventionally fractionated RT up to 59 Gy. At doses ≥60 Gy, there is an increased risk of RION, with greater risk for women and older patients.","['1 Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, USA.

259,Effect of Spectral Degradation and Spatio-Energy Correlation in X-Ray PCD for Imaging,"Charge sharing, scatter, and fluorescence events in a photon counting detector can result in counting of a single incident photon in multiple neighboring pixels, each at a fraction of the true energy. This causes energy distortion and correlation of data across energy bins in neighboring pixels (spatio-energy correlation), with the severity depending on the detector pixel size and detector material. If a ""macro-pixel"" is formed by combining the counts from multiple adjacent small pixels, it will exhibit correlations across its energy bins. Understanding these effects can be crucial for detector design and for model-based imaging applications. This paper investigates the impact of these effects in basis material and effective monoenergetic estimates using the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound. To do so, we derive a correlation model for the multi-counting events. CdTe detectors with grids of pixels with side length of $250~\mu \text{m}$ , $500~\mu \text{m}$ , and 1 mm were compared, with binning of $4\times4$ , $2\times2$ , and $1\times1$ pixels, respectively, to keep the same net 1 mm2 aperture constant. The same flux was applied to each. The mean and covariance matrix of measured photon counts were derived analytically using spatio-energy response functions precomputed from Monte Carlo simulations. Our results show that a 1 mm2 macro-pixel with $250\times 250\,\,\mu \text{m}^{\textsf {2}}$ sub-pixels shows 35% higher standard deviation than a single 1 mm2 pixel for material-specific imaging, while the penalty for effective monoenergetic imaging is <10% compared with a single 1 mm $^{\textsf {2}}$ pixel.

By host-guest chemistry, nanocarrier RuCD 70-90 nm in diameter is fabricated through a very simple mixing step in water at room temperature, in which the octahedral configuration of Ru complex provides a rigid skeleton and the hydrogen bonding of secondary hydroxyl groups formed between two adjacent β-CD monomers displays a bridging role allowing for three-dimensional architectures. The dual-drug-loaded nanoparticle Fu/LD@RuCD (Fu: 5-fluorouracil; LD: lonidamine) effectively penetrates into cancer cells in 8 h and selectively accumulates in lysosomes, in which dual-drug release is promoted by the mildly acidic environment. Under visible light irradiation, nanocarrier RuCD exhibits excellent photodynamic therapy capability by producing sufficient reactive oxygen species and damaging lysosomes, accordingly 5-fluorouracil and lonidamine can escape from lysosomes and reach their sites of action, resulting in mitochondria dysfunction and cancer cell apoptosis. Simultaneously, the excellent photophysical properties of the nanocarrier enable the facile track of drug delivery under one-photon and two-photon excitation. Moreover, in vivo anticancer investigations show that Fu/LD@RuCD can effectively inhibit the tumor growth without systemic side effects by chemo-photodynamic synergistic therapy, and the therapeutic effect is better than the free anticancer drugs and the sole therapeutic modality.","['1 MOE Key Laboratory of Bioinorganic and Synthetic Chemistry, School of Chemistry , Sun Yat-Sen University , Guangzhou 510275 , P.

262,Wavelength discrimination (WLD) TOF-PET detector with DOI information,"Depth-of-interaction (DOI) encoding can contribute to improving spatial resolution uniformity and sensitivity in positron-emission-tomography (PET) scanners. In addition, time-of-flight (TOF) PET scanners with DOI encoding have received considerable interest because of their potential for improving the spatial resolution, sensitivity, and image quality of the overall system. In this study, a new DOI detector configuration utilizing scintillators' emission wavelength is proposed, and experimental results on the energy, timing, and DOI performance of the detector are provided. The DOI information from the proposed phoswich-type detector can be acquired at the detector level without complex signal processing by utilizing a single optical filter with customized optical properties. For this, we used either a short pass filter (SPF) or a long pass filter (LPF) that allows light photons of a specific wavelength to pass. The two-layered phoswich detector was configured with two scintillators with different photon-emission spectra. In this study, we used Ce:GAGG (3 mm × 3 mm × 10 mm) and LYSO:Ce (3 mm × 3 mm × 10 mm) as the top and bottom layer scintillators, respectively. A digital silicon photomultiplier (dSiPM) was used as the photosensor and for data acquisition. The phoswich detector was placed in the center of two dSiPM pixels, where one of the dSiPM pixels was covered with the optical filter, and the light guide was placed on the other pixel. The detector was tested for energy, timing, and DOI encoding performance. When an SPF was used, the energy resolutions of 16.2% and 11.8% were achieved for the Ce:GAGG (top layer) and LYSO:Ce (bottom layer) respectively without correcting for saturation effect. With a small (3 mm × 3 mm × 5 mm) LYSO crystal as the reference detector, CRTs (coincidence-resolving times) of 338 ps and 244 ps were recorded for the top and bottom layers respectively. The detector configuration also provides an excellent DOI-separation figure-of-merit (FoM) value of 1.9. In the case of LPF, the energy resolutions of 12.0% and 12.9% were achieved for the Ce:GAGG (top layer) and LYSO:Ce (bottom layer), respectively. CRTs (coincidence resolving times) of 314 ps and 263 ps were recorded for the top and bottom layers, respectively. The DOI-separation FoM value of 1.5 was achieved in this setup. Results show that the proposed method can provide excellent discrete DOI positioning accuracy without compromising the timing performance of the detector.","['1 Department of Bio-Convergence, Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.

264,Optical biosensors based on refractometric sensing schemes: A review,"Biosensor technology is an active field of research and development presenting rapid progress in recent decades, and the subfield of optical biosensors based on refractometric sensing schemes has developed dramatically during this time. This review focuses on advances in the refractometric sensing-based guided-wave optical biosensors particularly in the last two decades. It starts with a concise discussion on the underlying principles of label-free refractometric biosensor. Subsequently, advances in biosensor design, especially the transducer configuration and the integration of the sensing device are reviewed, highlighting the challenges and efforts dedicated to improving this technology. Various surface functionalization strategies designed to produce well-defined and reproducible surface properties are introduced for evaluation. Refractometric sensing scheme-based optical biosensors have found versatile applications varying from environmental monitoring and food safety to clinical diagnostics, together with advances in these applications and others are described.

266,Detector-specific correction factors in radiosurgery beams and their impact on dose distribution calculations,"Silicon-diode-based detectors are commonly used for the dosimetry of small radiotherapy beams due to their relatively small volumes and high sensitivity to ionizing radiation. Nevertheless, silicon-diode-based detectors tend to over-respond in small fields because of their high density relative to water. For that reason, detector-specific beam correction factors ([Formula: see text]) have been recommended not only to correct the total scatter factors but also to correct the tissue maximum and off-axis ratios. However, the application of [Formula: see text] to in-depth and off-axis locations has not been studied. The goal of this work is to address the impact of the correction factors on the calculated dose distribution in static non-conventional photon beams (specifically, in stereotactic radiosurgery with circular collimators). To achieve this goal, the total scatter factors, tissue maximum, and off-axis ratios were measured with a stereotactic field diode for 4.0-, 10.0-, and 20.0-mm circular collimators. The irradiation was performed with a Novalis® linear accelerator using a 6-MV photon beam. The detector-specific correction factors were calculated and applied to the experimental dosimetry data for in-depth and off-axis locations. The corrected and uncorrected dosimetry data were used to commission a treatment planning system for radiosurgery planning. Various plans were calculated with simulated lesions using the uncorrected and corrected dosimetry. The resulting dose calculations were compared using the gamma index test with several criteria. The results of this work presented important conclusions for the use of detector-specific beam correction factors ([Formula: see text] in a treatment planning system. The use of [Formula: see text] for total scatter factors has an important impact on monitor unit calculation. On the contrary, the use of [Formula: see text] for tissue-maximum and off-axis ratios has not an important impact on the dose distribution calculation by the treatment planning system. This conclusion is only valid for the combination of treatment planning system, detector, and correction factors used in this work; however, this technique can be applied to other treatment planning systems, detectors, and correction factors.","['1 Laboratorio de Física Médica, Instituto Nacional de Neurología y Neurocirugía, México City, México.', '2 Posgrado en Ciencias Físicas, Instituto de Física, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Ciudad Universitaria, Mexico City, México.']","Olivia A García-Garduño, Manuel A Rodríguez-Ávila, José M Lárraga-Gutiérrez, ",PloS one,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29763446
267,Characteristic of EBT-XD and EBT3 radiochromic film dosimetry for photon and proton beams,"Recently, a new type of radiochromic film, the EBT-XD film, has been introduced for high dose radiotherapy. The EBT-XD film contains the same structure as the EBT3 film but has a slightly different composition and a thinner active layer. This study benchmarks the EBT-XD against EBT3 film for 6 MV and 10 MV photon beams, as well as for 97.4 MeV and 148.2 MeV proton beams and 15-100 kV x-rays. Dosimetric and film reading characteristics, such as post irradiation darkening, film orientation effect, lateral response artifact (LRA), film sensitivity, energy and beam quality dependency were investigated. Furthermore, quenching effects in the Bragg peak were investigated for a single proton beam energy for both film types, in addition measurements were performed in a spread-out Bragg peak. EBT-XD films showed the same characteristic on film darkening as EBT3. The effects between portrait and landscape orientation were reduced by 3.1% (in pixel value) for EBT-XD compared to EBT3 at a dose of 2000 cGy. The LRA is reduced for EBT-XD films for all investigated dose ranges. The sensitivity of EBT-XD films is superior to EBT3 for doses higher than 500 cGy. In addition, EBT-XD showed a similar dosimetric response for photon and proton irradiation with low energy and beam quality dependency. A quenching effect of 10% was found for both film types. The slight decrease in the thickness of the active layer and different composition configuration of EBT-XD resulted in a reduced film orientation effect and LRA, as well as a sensitivity increase in high-dose regions for both photon and proton beams. Overall, the EBT-XD film improved regarding film reading characteristics and showed advantages in the high-dose region for photon and proton beams.","['1 Division of Medical Radiation Physics, Department of Radiotherapy, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.

268,A Monte Carlo study on the PTW 60019 microDiamond detector,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      Data on the output correction factor for small photon beam dosimetry of the microDiamond detector manufactured by the company PTW can be found in a variety of papers. Referring either to measurements or to Monte Carlo (MC) calculations, they show substantial disagreements particularly at very small fields. This work reports results of a further MC study aiming at a better understanding of how specific properties of the microDiamond detector are influencing its output correction factor and whether this can explain at least some of the disagreements. Methods:
      
    

    
      In this study the method of a fluence-based decomposition of the dose conversion factor was used which is considered as a useful tool to understand the response of a detector in nonreference conditions. This decomposition method yields the following three factors: (a) the stopping power ratio water to diamond, (b) a perturbation factor pint taking into account all fluence changes in the transition from a small water voxel at the point of dose determination to the bare diamond detector, and (c) a perturbation factor pext taking into account all additional fluence changes in the fully simulated diamond detector caused by the material and design details outside the sensitive volume. Results:
      
    

    
      Monte Carlo calculated output correction factors were obtained for Co-60, 6 MV and 10 MV photon beams showing that the maximum variation with field size remained in the order of 2% for quadratic field sizes larger than about 0.3 cm. For field sizes smaller than about 0.5 cm a clear under-response is obtained at all three radiation qualities in agreement with all known MC calculations, however, in contrast to some measured result. The shape of the output correction factor can be well explained by an opposite mode of action between under-response expressed by the perturbation factor pint and over-response expressed by the perturbation factor pext where the first one is mainly influenced by volume averaging, and the second one by a back scatter effect of electrons from the diamond substrate into the sensitive volume. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The response of microDiamond detector can be well described under various measuring conditions by the dose conversion factor and the dependency of its fluence-based subfactors on detector characteristics. Monte Carlo simulations offer an improvement in the understanding particularly of small-field effects by relating the output correction factor to spectral fluence changes in the sensitive volume of the detector. The most significant influence factors are the finite size of the active volume and the presence of the high-density diamond substrate causing a field size-dependent backscattering. These perturbations are opposite in their effects. The diamond in the sensitive volume itself and in particular its density has almost no influence. Scattering of results at very small field sizes can be explained by different gradients of dose profiles around the beam axis at identical full width half maximum (FWHM) field size parameters and by possible deviations of the radius of the sensitive volume from the nominal radius. The backscattering effect also has an influence on the determination of profiles and for very small field sizes on the response at different rotation angles.","['1 German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.', '2 Institute of Medical Physics and Radiation Protection (IMPS), University of Applied Sciences Giessen, 35390, Giessen, Germany.', '3 Department for Radiotherapy and Radiooncology, University Medical Center Giessen-Marburg, 35043, Marburg, Germany.', '4 Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies (FIAS), Goethe-University, 60438, Frankfurt, Germany.']","Günther H Hartmann, Klemens Zink, ",Medical physics,2019 Nov,Monte Carlo calculation; microdiamond detector; output correction factors; perturbation factors; small beam dosimetry.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31314919

      To study the dosimetric properties of electron arc beams delivered by photon-beam multi-leaf collimators (pMLC) in electron modulated arc therapy (EMAT) for postmastectomy chest wall treatments. Methods:
      
    

    
      Using the Monte Carlo method, we simulated a 2100EX Varian linear accelerator and verified the beam models in a water tank. Dosimetric characterizations were performed on cylindrical water phantoms of elliptical bases with various field sizes, arc ranges and source-to-surface distances (SSDs) for 6, 9 and 12 MeV beam energy. Results:
      
    

    
      The arc beam has a higher bremsstrahlung dose than the static beam at the isocenter due to crossfire, but choosing a field size greater than 5 cm effectively reduces the bremsstrahlung dose. The depths of the 90% maximum dose located at 1.7, 2.8 and 4.1 cm for 6, 9 and 12 MeV, respectively, are similar to those of the static beams and independent of the field size and arc range. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Based on the study, we recommend using the 5 cm field width for electron arc beams considering both bremsstrahlung dose at the isocenter and the arc profile penumbra. To ensure sufficient PTV edge coverage, we recommend a field length extension of at least 4 cm from PTV's edge for all beam energies and an arc extension of around 7°, 5°, and 5° for beam energies 6, 9, and 12 MeV, respectively.

In this research we used nanometric and micrometric analyses to investigate the morphological and mechanical properties of the black-orange-black (BOB) color pattern in scelionid wasps, which has never been studied. The primary objective of the present investigation was to explore the structural and mechanical differences in the mesoscutum of four species: Baryconus with an orange mesosoma (i.e. BOB pattern), all black Baryconus, Scelio with an orange mesosoma (i.e. BOB pattern), and all black Scelio. The most outstanding findings include the absence of multilayer structures that generate structural color, a pigment concentrated in the upper surface of the epicuticle, and surprising differences between the four species. Three of the four species showed an accordion-like structure in the furrow (notaulus), whereas the adjacent mesoscutum was different in each species. Moreover, the normalized color component spectra for blue, green and red colors of the black mesoscutum of each genus showed the same spectral dependence while the orange color manifested small changes in the dominant wavelength, resulting in slightly different orange tones.","['1 Centro de Investigación en Biología Celular y Molecular, Universidad de Costa Rica, 11501, San Pedro de Montes de Oca, Costa Rica. rebeca.mora@ucr.ac.cr.', '2 Escuela de Biología, Universidad de Costa Rica, 11501, San Pedro de Montes de Oca, Costa Rica. rebeca.mora@ucr.ac.cr.', '3 Centro de Investigación en Ciencia e Ingeniería de Materiales and Escuela de Física, Universidad de Costa Rica, 11501, San Pedro de Montes de Oca, Costa Rica. rebeca.mora@ucr.ac.cr.', '4 Centro de Investigación en Ciencia e Ingeniería de Materiales and Escuela de Física, Universidad de Costa Rica, 11501, San Pedro de Montes de Oca, Costa Rica.', '5 Departamento de Física, Universidad Nacional, 86-3000, Heredia, Costa Rica.', '6 Sección de Patología, Hospital San Juan de Dios, San José, Costa Rica.', '7 Escuela de Biología, Universidad de Costa Rica, 11501, San Pedro de Montes de Oca, Costa Rica.']","Rebeca Mora-Castro, Marcela Hernández-Jiménez, Giovanni Sáenz-Arce, Juan Porras-Peñaranda, Paul Hanson-Snortum, Esteban Avendaño-Soto, ",Scientific reports,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31996729

Sensitivity of the sensor reaches -3.64 nm/°C, far greater than conventional temperature sensors. Our research also demonstrates that the transmission spectrum could be modulated efficiently by the ratio of semi-short axis to semi-major axis of the ellipse resonators and the width of two same rectangular tubes.

However, these techniques operated in liquid environments generally suffer from pattern collapses, Brownian motion, and challenges that come with reconfigurable assembly. Here, we develop an all-optical technique, termed optothermally-gated photon nudging (OPN), for the versatile manipulation and dynamic patterning of a variety of colloidal particles on a solid substrate at nanoscale accuracy. OPN takes advantage of a thin surfactant layer to optothermally modulate the particle-substrate interaction, which enables the manipulation of colloidal particles on solid substrates with optical scattering force. Along with in situ optical spectroscopy, our non-invasive and contactless nanomanipulation technique will find various applications in nanofabrication, nanophotonics, nanoelectronics, and colloidal sciences.","['1 Materials Science and Engineering Program and Texas Materials Institute, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA.', '2 Walker Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA.', '3 Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA.', '4 McKetta Department of Chemical Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA.', '5 Materials Science and Engineering Program and Texas Materials Institute, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA. zheng@austin.utexas.edu.', '6 Walker Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA. zheng@austin.utexas.edu.']","Jingang Li, Yaoran Liu, Linhan Lin, Mingsong Wang, Taizhi Jiang, Jianhe Guo, Hongru Ding, Pavana Siddhartha Kollipara, Yuji Inoue, Donglei Fan, Brian A Korgel, Yuebing Zheng, ",Nature communications,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31831746
280,High-resolution ultramicroscopy of the developing and adult nervous system in optically cleared Drosophila melanogaster,"The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is an important experimental model to address central questions in neuroscience at an organismic level. However, imaging of neural circuits in intact fruit flies is limited due to structural properties of the cuticle. Here we present a novel approach combining tissue clearing, ultramicroscopy, and data analysis that enables the visualisation of neuronal networks with single-cell resolution from the larval stage up to the adult Drosophila. FlyClear, the signal preserving clearing technique we developed, stabilises tissue integrity and fluorescence signal intensity for over a month and efficiently removes the overall pigmentation. An aspheric ultramicroscope set-up utilising an improved light-sheet generator allows us to visualise long-range connections of peripheral sensory and central neurons in the visual and olfactory system. High-resolution 3D reconstructions with isotropic resolution from entire GFP-expressing flies are obtained by applying image fusion from orthogonal directions. This methodological integration of novel chemical, optical, and computational techniques allows a major advance in the analysis of global neural circuit organisation.","['1 Department for Bioelectronics, FKE, Vienna University of Technology, Gußhausstraße 25-25A, Building CH, 1040, Vienna, Austria. marko.pende@tuwien.ac.at.', '2 Section of Bioelectronics, Center for Brain Research, Medical University of Vienna, Spitalgasse 4, 1090, Vienna, Austria. marko.pende@tuwien.ac.at.', '3 Department for Bioelectronics, FKE, Vienna University of Technology, Gußhausstraße 25-25A, Building CH, 1040, Vienna, Austria.', '4 Section of Bioelectronics, Center for Brain Research, Medical University of Vienna, Spitalgasse 4, 1090, Vienna, Austria.', '5 Department of Neurobiology, University of Vienna, Althanstrasse 14, 1090, Vienna, Austria.', '6 Department of Ecogenomics and Systems Biology, Archaeal Biology and Ecogenomics Division, University of Vienna, Althanstrasse 14, 1090, Vienna, Austria.', '7 Department for Bioelectronics, FKE, Vienna University of Technology, Gußhausstraße 25-25A, Building CH, 1040, Vienna, Austria. hans.ulrich.dodt@tuwien.ac.at.', '8 Section of Bioelectronics, Center for Brain Research, Medical University of Vienna, Spitalgasse 4, 1090, Vienna, Austria. hans.ulrich.dodt@tuwien.ac.at.']","Marko Pende, Klaus Becker, Martina Wanis, Saiedeh Saghafi, Rashmit Kaur, Christian Hahn, Nika Pende, Massih Foroughipour, Thomas Hummel, Hans-Ulrich Dodt, ",Nature communications,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30413688
281,ENERGY RESPONSE OF FLUORESCENT NUCLEAR TRACK DETECTORS OF VARIOUS COLORATIONS TO MONOENERGETIC NEUTRONS,"The neutron-energy dependence of the track-counting sensitivity of fluorescent nuclear track detectors (FNTDs) at two ranges of Mg doping, resulting in different crystal colorations, was investigated. The performance of FNTDs was studied with the following converters: Li-glass for thermal to intermediate-energy neutrons, polyethylene for fast neutrons, and polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon™) for photon- and radon-background subtraction. The irradiations with monoenergetic neutrons were performed at the National Physics Laboratory (NPL), UK. The energy range was varied from 144 keV to 16.5 MeV in the personal dose equivalent range from 1 to 3 mSv. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to model the response of FNTDs to monoenergetic neutrons. A good agreement with the experimental data was observed suggesting the development of a basic model for future MC studies. Further work will focus on increasing FNTD sensitivity to low-energy neutrons and developing a faster imaging technique for scanning larger areas to improve counting statistics.","['1 Landauer, Crystal Growth Division, 723 ½ Eastgate Rd, Stillwater, OK, USA.', '2 Landauer-Europe, 9, rue Paul Dautier, CS 60731, Vélizy-Villacoublay Cedex, France.']","V Fomenko, B Moreno, M Million, J Harrison, M Akselrod, ",Radiation protection dosimetry,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29077974

      To determine the effect of photon-initiated photoacoustic streaming (PIPS) on the extrusion of debris using multiple-file (ProTaper Next-PTN) and single-file (One Shape-OS) continuous rotary systems in curved canals in human molar teeth. Methodology:
      
    

    
      Sixty extracted maxillary first molar teeth with curved mesial roots, mature apices and of similar lengths were selected. Teeth having canals with apical diameters larger than size 15 were discarded. The teeth were randomly divided into four experimental groups (n = 15 teeth per group) according to the file used and irrigation systems: (i) OS with PIPS with a 2940 nm Er:YAG laser (0.3 W, 15 Hz, and 20 mJ), (ii) OS with conventional needle irrigation (CNI) with a 27-G needle, (iii) PTN with PIPS and (iv) PTN with CNI. The PIPS and CNI was applied during each file change for 20 s. Total irrigation and activation time was 1 min, and a total volume of 7.5 mL of bidistilled water was used as the irrigant. The apically extruded debris was collected into pre-weighed Eppendorf tubes. The tubes were then stored in an incubator at 70 °C for 5 days. The weight of dry extruded debris was assessed by subtracting the initial weight of the tube from the final weight. The results were analysed statistically using one-way analysis of variance and Tukey's post hoc tests. Bonferroni correction was used to compare the groups. Results:
      
    

    
      The PIPS irrigation technique was associated with significantly more debris extrusion than the CNI system (P < 0.05). The single-file (One Shape-OS) rotary system was associated with more debris than the multiple-file (ProTaper Next-PTN) rotary systems when the same irrigation system was used (P > 0.05). The total amount of debris extruded apically by PIPS activation was significantly greater than that by CNI (P < 0.05). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      All file and irrigation systems extruded debris apically. PIPS activation was associated with significantly more extrusion debris in curved canals compared with no activation.","['1 Department of Endodontics, Faculty of Dentistry, Istanbul Aydın University, Istanbul.', '2 Department of Endodontics, Faculty of Dentistry, Akdeniz University, Antalya, Turkey.']","D Arslan, A Kustarci, ",International endodontic journal,2018 Jan,ProTaper Next; debris extrusion; laser activation; one shape; photon-initiated photoacoustic streaming.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28708251

284,Creating correct blur and its effect on accommodation,"Blur occurs naturally when the eye is focused at one distance and an object is presented at another distance. Computer-graphics engineers and vision scientists often wish to create display images that reproduce such depth-dependent blur, but their methods are incorrect for that purpose. They take into account the scene geometry, pupil size, and focal distances, but do not properly take into account the optical aberrations of the human eye. We developed a method that, by incorporating the viewer's optics, yields displayed images that produce retinal images close to the ones that occur in natural viewing. We concentrated on the effects of defocus, chromatic aberration, astigmatism, and spherical aberration and evaluated their effectiveness by conducting experiments in which we attempted to drive the eye's focusing response (accommodation) through the rendering of these aberrations. We found that accommodation is not driven at all by conventional rendering methods, but that it is driven surprisingly quickly and accurately by our method with defocus and chromatic aberration incorporated. We found some effect of astigmatism but none of spherical aberration. We discuss how the rendering approach can be used in vision science experiments and in the development of ophthalmic/optometric devices and augmented- and virtual-reality displays.","['1 Optometry & Vision Science, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.', '2 Computer Science & Physics, Durham University, Durham, UK.']","Steven A Cholewiak, Gordon D Love, Martin S Banks, ",Journal of vision,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30193343
285,"Generalized nonlinear Schrödinger equations describing the Second Harmonic Generation of femtosecond pulse, containing a few cycles, and their integrals of motion","An interaction of laser pulse, containing a few cycles, with substance is a modern problem, attracting attention of many researches. The frequency conversion is a key problem for a generation of such pulses in various ranges of frequencies. Adequate description of such pulse interaction with a medium is based on a slowly evolving wave approximation (SEWA), which has been proposed earlier for a description of propagation of the laser pulse, containing a few cycles, in a medium with cubic nonlinear response. Despite widely applicability of the frequency conversion for various nonlinear optics problems solutions, SEWA has not been applied and developed for a theoretical investigation of the frequency doubling process until present time. In this study the set of generalized nonlinear Schrödinger equations describing a second harmonic generation of the super-short femtosecond pulse is derived. The equations set contains terms, describing the pulses self-steepening, and the second order dispersion (SOD) of the pulse, a diffraction of the beam as well as mixed derivatives. We propose the transform of the equations set to a type, which does not contain both the mixed derivatives and time derivatives of the nonlinear terms. This transform allows us to derive the integrals of motion of the problem: energy, spectral invariants and Hamiltonian. We show the existence of two specific frequencies (singularities in the Fourier space) inherent to the problem. They may cause an appearance of non-physical absolute instability of the problem solution if the spectral invariants are not taken into account. Moreover, we claim that the energy preservation at the laser pulses propagation may not occur if these invariants do not preserve. Developed conservation laws, in particular, have to be used for developing of the conservative finite-difference schemes, preserving the conservation laws difference analogues, and for developing of adequate theory of the modulation instability of the laser pulses, containing a few cycles.","['1 Faculty of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics, Lomonosov Moscow State University, Moscow, Russia.']","Vyacheslav A Trofimov, Svetlana Stepanenko, Alexander Razgulin, ",PloS one,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31830072
286,"Technical Note: EPID's response to 6 MV photons in a strong, parallel magnetic field","Purpose:
      
    

    
      Electronic portal imaging devices (EPIDs) are potentially useful for dosimetric verification in integrated MRI-linac systems. This work presents the reproducibility, linearity, image lag, and radiation field profiles in a conventional EPID, with and without a 0.5 T parallel magnetic field present in a 6 MV photon beam. Methods:
      
    

    
      An aS500 EPID was modified to function in strong magnetic fields. All measurements were made using the linac-MR installed at the Cross Cancer Institute. The EPID remained stationary on the couch between the measurements made with and without magnetic field. We measured short-term reproducibility of dark and flood fields, signal linearity from 1 to 500 MU irradiations, and image lag post 100 MU irradiation. An ion chamber was used to measure any linac output variations to correct the EPID signal due to these variations for the duration of experiment. X-axis and Y-axis radiation field profiles were obtained from the EPID image resulting from a 10 × 10 cm2 radiation field delivery. Results:
      
    

    
      The average pixel value (±standard deviation) of flood field with and without magnetic fields were 57,876 ± 379 and 57,703 ± 366, respectively, and the corresponding average dark field pixel values were -32.05 ± 0.85 and -32.19 ± 0.97. The maximum difference in image linearity data with and without magnetic field is 0.2% which is well within the measurement uncertainty of 0.65%. Similarly, the image lag curves, with and without the magnetic field, were nearly identical. The first measured point, with mean lag signal of 1.44% without and 1.41% with magnetic field, shows that the largest difference is well below the uncertainty in the EPID signal measurement. The radiation field profiles obtained with and without magnetic fields were nearly identical; 91.3% of the X-axis and 95.2% of the Y-axis profile points pass a gamma criterion of 1% and 1 mm. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      A conventional EPID imager with a 0.1 cm copper plate responds to 6 MV photons similarly irrespective of the strong magnetic field being off or on in the parallel orientation to the radiation beam. Thus, the EPID is a potentially useful tool for pretreatment dosimetric verification in linac-MR systems using parallel magnetic field.","['1 Department of Medical Physics, Cross Cancer Institute, 11560 University Avenue, Edmonton, Alberta, T6G 1Z2, Canada.', '2 Department of Oncology, Medical Physics Division, University of Alberta, 11560 University Avenue, Edmonton, Alberta, T6G 1Z2, Canada.', '3 Departments of Oncology and Physics, University of Alberta, 11560 University Avenue, Edmonton, Alberta, T6G 1Z2, Canada.']","Satyapal Rathee, B Gino Fallone, Stephen Steciw, ",Medical physics,2019 Jan,EPID; MRI-linac; linac-MR.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30417382

The beam properties assessed by photon diagnostics throughout these phases included per-pulse intensity, beam position, shape, lateral dimensions and spectral properties. During this time period, the machine provided users with up to 14 keV photon energy, 1.5 mJ pulse energy, 300 FEL pulses per train and 4.5 MHz intra-bunch train repetition rate at a 10 Hz train repetition rate.

In addition, a magnetic orientation technique enabled us to dynamically modulate the arrangement of platelets floating in water. A group orientation of the platelets under magnetic fields exhibited a distinct enhancement of the light interference between platelets present in the micro-space, and a two-fold enhancement of the reflected light intensity was achieved by comparing two arrangements of magnetically oriented platelets.

      The study included patients having cataract surgery with insertion of a quadrifocal IOL over 15 months. Preoperative biometry measurements were obtained from an IOLMaster 500. Optimized IOL constants were calculated to reduce the mean refractive prediction error. The primary outcomes were differences in mean absolute prediction error between the formulas.

      The study comprised 75 eyes of 38 patients. The formulas were ranked by the mean absolute refractive prediction error as follows: Barrett Universal II (0.294 D), Hill-RBF (0.332 D), Olsen (0.339 D), T2 (0.351 D), Holladay 1 (0.381 D), Haigis (0.382 D), SRK/T (0.393 D), Holladay 2 (0.399 D), and Hoffer Q (0.410 D).

Stunning displays of coloration have evolved throughout nature to optimize camouflage, warning, and communication. The resulting flamboyant visual effects and remarkable dynamic properties, often caused by an intricate structural design at the nano- and microscale, continue to inspire scientists to unravel the underlying physics and to recreate the observed effects. Here, the methodologies to create bioinspired photonic pigments using colloidal self-assembly approaches are considered. The physics governing the interaction of light with structural features and natural examples of structural coloration are briefly introduced. It is then outlined how the self-assembly of colloidal particles, acting as wavelength-scale building blocks, can be particularly useful to replicate coloration from nature. Different coloration effects that result from the defined structure of the self-assembled colloids are introduced and it is highlighted how these optical properties can be translated into photonic pigments by modifications of the assembly processes. The importance of absorbing elements, as well as the role of surface chemistry and wettability to control structural coloration is discussed.

295,General ion recombination effect in a liquid ionization chamber in high-dose-rate pulsed photon and electron beams,"Liquid ionization chambers (LICs) are highly sensitive to dose irradiation and have small perturbations because of their liquid-filled sensitive volume. They require a sensitive volume much smaller than conventional air-filled chambers. However, it has been reported that the collection efficiency has dependencies on the dose per pulse and the pulse repetition frequency of a pulsed beam. The purpose of this study was to evaluate in detail the dependency of the ion collection efficiency on the pulse repetition frequency. A microLion (PTW, Freiburg, Germany) LIC was exposed to photon and electron beams from a TrueBeam (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, USA) linear accelerator. The pulse repetition frequency was varied, but the dose per pulse was fixed. A theoretical evaluation of the collection efficiency was performed based on Boag's theory. Linear correlations were observed between the frequency and the relative collection for all energies of the photon and electron beams. The decrease in the collected charge was within 1% for all the flattened photon and electron beams, and they were 1.1 and 1.8% for the 6 and 10 MV flattening filter-free photon beams, respectively. The theoretical ion collection efficiency was 0.990 for a 10 MV flattened photon beam with a dose rate of 3 Gy·min-1. It is suggested that the collected charge decreased because of the short time intervals of the beam pulse compared with the ion collection time. Thus, it is important to correctly choose the pulse repetition frequency, particularly when flattening filter-free mode is used for absolute dose measurements.","['1 Proton Medical Research Center, University of Tsukuba Hospital, 2 Chome-1-1 Amakubo, Tsukuba, Ibaraki Prefecture 305-8576, Japan.', '2 National Institute of Radiological Sciences, National Institutes for Quantum and Radiological Science and Technology, 4-9-1 Anagawa, Inage, Chiba, Chiba 263-8555, Japan.', '3 Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8575, Japan.', '4 Department of Radiation Oncology, The Cancer Institute Hospital of Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, 3 Chome-8-31 Ariake, Koto, Tokyo 135-0063, Japan.', '5 Department of Radiology, University of Tsukuba Hospital, 2 Chome-1-1 Amakubo, Tsukuba, Ibaraki Prefecture 305-8576, Japan.']","Hideyuki Takei, Tomonori Isobe, Nozomi Kitamura, Yutaro Mori, Tetsuya Tomita, Daisuke Kobayashi, Satoshi Kamizawa, Tomoharu Sato, Hideyuki Sakurai, Takeji Sakae, ",Journal of radiation research,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29373670
296,Two Photon Spectroscopy Can Serve as a Marker of Protein Denaturation Pathway,"Rhodamine group of molecules are widely used dyes for imaging of biological molecules. Application of these dyes however includes a limitation that these molecules absorb in the visible range of the spectrum, which does not fall in the 'biologically transparent window' (BTW). Two photon absorption (TPA) process could come up with an alternate solution to this as these dyes could be excited in the near infrared (NIR) window to extract similar information. To validate this we have investigated TPA cross section (TPACS, σ2) of two rhodamine dyes, namely Rhodamine 6G (R6G), Rhodamine B (RhB), site selectively bound with a model protein, bovine serum albumin (BSA), by exciting at 800 nm. Two photon spectroscopy and imaging confirms the binding of the dye to the protein. The decreases in TPACS with increasing temperature at a fixed BSA concentration excellently follows the temperature induced structural transition of BSA as the protein transforms from a molten globule to unfolded conformation beyond 60 °C, which has previously been established through circular dichroism (CD) measurements. The thus established resemblance in TPACS and CD measurement trends thus strongly affirms the suitability of TPA process in protein imaging and as an alternative marker to tracking its conformational transformations using NIR radiation.","['1 Department of Chemical, Biological & Macromolecular Sciences, S.

297,Label-Free Monitoring of Human IgG/Anti-IgG Recognition Using Bloch Surface Waves on 1D Photonic Crystals,"Optical biosensors based on one-dimensional photonic crystals sustaining Bloch surface waves are proposed to study antibody interactions and perform affinity studies. The presented approach utilizes two types of different antibodies anchored at the sensitive area of a photonic crystal-based biosensor. Such a strategy allows for creating two or more on-chip regions with different biochemical features as well as studying the binding kinetics of biomolecules in real time. In particular, the proposed detection system shows an estimated limit of detection for the target antibody (anti-human IgG) smaller than 0.19 nM (28 ng/mL), corresponding to a minimum surface mass coverage of 10.3 ng/cm². Moreover, from the binding curves we successfully derived the equilibrium association and dissociation constants (KA = 7.5 × 10⁷ M-1; KD = 13.26 nM) of the human IgG⁻anti-human IgG interaction.","['1 Department of Basic and Applied Science for Engineering SBAI, Sapienza University of Rome, 00161 Rome, Italy. alberto.sinibaldi@uniroma1.it.', '2 Department of Basic and Applied Science for Engineering SBAI, Sapienza University of Rome, 00161 Rome, Italy. agostino.occhicone@uniroma1.it.', '3 Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Optics and Precision Engineering IOF, Albert-Einstein-Str. 7, 07745 Jena, Germany. peter.munzert@iof.fraunhofer.de.', '4 Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Optics and Precision Engineering IOF, Albert-Einstein-Str. 7, 07745 Jena, Germany. norbert.danz@iof.fraunhofer.de.', '5 Fraunhofer Institute for Material and Beam Technology IWS, Winterbergstr. 28, 01277 Dresden, Germany. frank.sonntag@iws.fraunhofer.de.', '6 Department of Basic and Applied Science for Engineering SBAI, Sapienza University of Rome, 00161 Rome, Italy. francesco.michelotti@uniroma1.it.']","Alberto Sinibaldi, Agostino Occhicone, Peter Munzert, Norbert Danz, Frank Sonntag, Francesco Michelotti, ",Biosensors,2018,Bloch surface waves; human IgG screening; one-dimensional photonic crystals; optical biosensors.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30044392
298,A preclinical PET detector constructed with a monolithic scintillator ring,"This paper presents a unique preclinical positron emission tomography (PET) detector constructed with a monolithic scintillator ring (MSR) and two rings of silicon photomultipliers (SiPM). The inner diameter, outer diameter and length of the MSR were 48.5 mm, 58.5 mm, and 25.1 mm, respectively. The two SiPM rings, constructed with 46 SiPMs, were air-coupled to the two ends of the MSR detector. The center of gravity (COG) and artificial neural network (ANN) methods were adapted to decode the positions of the gamma interactions in the circumferential (θ) and axial (Z) directions, respectively. Collimating systems, consisting of a tungsten collimator and a high-precision displacement and rotating platform, were constructed to assess the decoding accuracies of the MSR detector in both θ and Z directions. The average intrinsic full-width half maximums (FWHMs) and mean absolute errors (MAEs) of the decoding accuracies were 0.94 mm and 0.33 mm in the circumferential direction, 2.45 mm and 1.08 mm in the axial direction. An energy resolution of 10.7% was measured at 511 keV. The scintillating photons generated by a pair of coincidence gamma photons overlap with each other, and cause circumferential parallax errors in the lines of response (LOR). The experimental results show that the average FWHM errors in the θ direction increased slightly from 0.94 mm to 1.14 mm when Δθ of the two single events was larger than 70°. The imaging performance of the MSR detector was also initially assessed with a Derenzo phantom filled with 18F-FDG. The rods with a diameter larger than 1.2 mm can be resolved. The energy resolutions were 12.3% at 511 keV (single events), and 11.4% at 1022 keV (coincidence events). We concluded that it is feasible to construct the high-performance preclinical PET scanners using one or multiple MSR detectors.","[""1 State Key Lab of Digital Manufacturing Equipment and Technology, School of Mechanical Science and Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430074, People's Republic of China.

Of particular interest are systems using light as the external trigger to induce the color changes. Here we report on a tri-component cocktail consisting of a fluorescent donor molecule and two photochromic acceptor molecules encapsulated in polymer micelles and we show that the color of the emitted fluorescence can be continuously changed from blue-to-green and from blue-to-red upon selective light-induced isomerization of the photochromic acceptors to the fluorescent forms. Interestingly, isomerization of both acceptors to different degrees allows for the generation of all emission colors within the red-green-blue (RGB) color system. The function relies on orthogonally controlled FRET reactions between the blue emitting donor and the green and red emitting acceptors, respectively.","['1 Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Chemistry and Biochemistry, Chalmers University of Technology, 41296, Göteborg, Sweden.', '2 Department of Chemistry and Research Center for Smart Molecules, Rikkyo University Nishi-Ikebukuro 3-34-1, Toshima-ku, Tokyo, 171-8501, Japan.', '3 Laboratory for Molecular Photonics, Department of Chemistry, University of Miami, 1301 Memorial Drive, Coral Gables, FL, 33146-0431, USA.', '4 Departament de Química, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, 08193, Cerdanyola del Vallès, Spain.', '5 Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Chemistry and Biochemistry, Chalmers University of Technology, 41296, Göteborg, Sweden. a-son@chalmers.se.']","Gaowa Naren, Chien-Wei Hsu, Shiming Li, Masakazu Morimoto, Sicheng Tang, Jordi Hernando, Gonzalo Guirado, Masahiro Irie, Françisco M Raymo, Henrik Sundén, Joakim Andréasson, ",Nature communications,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31488822
302,Dosimetric evaluation and beam characterization of pair production enhanced radiotherapy (PPER) with the use of organometallics,"The current study evaluates dosimetric and spectral effects when platinum (Pt)-based chemotherapeutics and less toxic tungstophosphoric-acid (TPA) organometallics are present during x-ray radiotherapy. We hypothesize that the use of high energy photon beams (i.e. 18 MV) will increase absorbed dose due to increased pair production from high-Z elements and thus result in additional tumor cell kill. EGSnrc code was used to examine the contribution of pair production to dose in the presence of the high-Z material (TPA, Pt mixtures and tungsten, W) as a function of beam energy. Variables included different concentrations (100 µmolar, 1 mmolar), depths (5 mm, 10 cm), thicknesses (5 mm, 5 cm) and energies (6, 18 MV). Overall, for the deeper depth, the 511 keV photon fluence increase was up 31% (18 MV-1 mmolar) while at 6 MV it was between 10%-11% depending on the concentration. For the shallower depth, 18 MV fluence increase was up 14.6% (1 mmolar) and 18.6% (1 mmolar) for the 6 MV. The dose enhancement effect due to pair production was up 25%-30% and a total 33%-58% depending on the depth. The benefit related to pair production was more for 18 MV and under conditions that simulated a realistic clinical setup. While part of the effect could be attributed to photoabsorption, a significant contribution of dose could result from pair production. Experimental clonogenic survival assay was consistent with the theory in that the low dose shoulder region of a cell survival curve was reduced using TPA and 18 MV compared with TPA and 6 MV or compared with no TPA and 18 MV; RBE was approximately 2 at the dose commonly used in conventional fractionated clinical radiotherapy. This suggests a potential new strategy for dose enhancement based on pair production using higher energy beamlines.",['1 Author to whom any correspondence should be addressed.'],"P Tsiamas, S L Brown, I J Chetty, J H Kim, D Isrow, ",Physics in medicine and biology,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30875697
303,Modeling the primary source intensity distribution: reconstruction and inter-comparison of six Varian TrueBeam sources,"The primary source size is one of the most important beam model parameters in small photon fields. In this work we apply a recently suggested reconstruction technique to characterize the primary source of 6 Varian TrueBeam (TB) linacs. A series of photon fluence profile measurements were performed on 6 Varian TB linacs in the crossplane and inplane orientation using radiochromic film in air and a 2 mm Pb foil as a build-up layer. An image reconstruction algorithm was then applied, based on the maximum likelihood expectation-maximization (MLEM) algorithm, to estimate the source distribution. The method iteratively ray-traces photons from the source plane to the measurement plane to extract source profile corrections. The technique was first benchmarked using a Monte Carlo (MC) model of a Varian TrueBeam with known input Gaussian source sizes. The robustness of the suggested technique was also tested by randomly sampling different combinations of source and field size values and repeating the reconstruction. At the MC benchmarking stage the MLEM reconstruction algorithm was capable of reproducing the Gaussian shape with a RMSE less than 4.0%, while the reconstructed source size (FWHM) and field size were determined with an accuracy level of 0.14 mm and 0.10 mm respectively. Experimentally, the reconstructed TB sources presented FWHM values between 1.02-1.5 mm ([Formula: see text]-0.18 mm) and 1.08-1.42 mm ([Formula: see text]-0.13 mm) in the crossplane and inplane orientations respectively. All TB sources studied in this work can be considered symmetric within uncertainties with the exception of one. The source distribution presented systematic deviations from a Gaussian distribution mostly in the lower tail region. Multi-parameter functional forms, such as Pearson VII or double Gaussian presented improvements in modeling the source in this region, but increase the model complexity. The reconstructed sources measured in this work can serve as reference values for commissioning beam models in small fields and set upper and lower thresholds values of the expected source size for a TB linac.","['1 Medical Physics Unit and the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, McGill University, Quebec, Canada.

Processing the static scattering speckle pattern by neural networks enables extraction of unique features with no previous expert knowledge being required. Using the right model allows for a very accurate differentiation between desirable categories, and that model can form a basis for using speckles patterns as a form of identity measure of 'forehead-print'.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Zeev Kalyzhner, Or Levitas, Felix Kalichman, Ron Jacobson, Zeev Zalevsky, ",Optics express,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31878764
305,Two-crossed-polarizers based optical property modulation method for ionizing radiation detection for positron emission tomography,"Recent work shows that Pockels effect and optics pump-probe measurement could be utilized as a novel method for 511 keV ionizing radiation photon detection for positron emission tomography (PET) which could potentially overcome the inherent physical limitation for coincidence time resolution of around 100 ps (Tao et al 2016 Phys. Med. Biol. 61 7600-22). In this paper, we embrace this observation and introduce a two-crossed-polarizers based setup to achieve similar detection concept, which is a simpler and more compact setup with comparable ionizing radiation detection capability as the setup used in the previously proposed work. We evaluated the performance of our experimental setup with Lithium Niobate (LiNbO3) and Cadmium Telluride (CdTe) detector crystals, and the desired properties of an ideal detector crystal were discussed. The modulation signal induced by 511 keV photons in both LiNbO3 and CdTe can be detected with repeatable signal amplitude using two-crossed-polarizers based method, while CdTe could provide eight times higher detection sensitivity to 511 keV photons than LiNbO3 under the same bias voltage, suggesting high effective Z number and high density properties of CdTe, as well as a shorter carrier lifetime and lower carrier mobility of LiNbO3. In addition, the strength of modulation signal increased linearly with bias voltage before saturation. The modulation signal strength in LiNbO3 continued to increase after 2000 V due to its high resistivity which could reduce the dark current in the detector, while the modulation signal of CdTe with low resistivity tended to be saturated at a bias voltage higher than 1200 V. Therefore, further increasing the bias voltage for detector crystals (especially for LiNbO3) may enhance the modulation strength and improve the detection sensitivity for annihilation photons.","[""1 China-EU Institute for Clean and Renewable Energy, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430074, People's Republic of China.

309,Monte Carlo studies on photon interactions in radiobiological experiments,"X-ray and γ-ray photons have been widely used for studying radiobiological effects of ionizing radiations. Photons are indirectly ionizing radiations so they need to set in motion electrons (which are a directly ionizing radiation) to perform the ionizations. When the photon dose decreases to below a certain limit, the number of electrons set in motion will become so small that not all cells in an ""exposed"" cell population can get at least one electron hit. When some cells in a cell population are not hit by a directly ionizing radiation (in other words not irradiated), there will be rescue effect between the irradiated cells and non-irradiated cells, and the resultant radiobiological effect observed for the ""exposed"" cell population will be different. In the present paper, the mechanisms underlying photon interactions in radiobiological experiments were studied using our developed NRUphoton computer code, which was benchmarked against the MCNP5 code by comparing the photon dose delivered to the cell layer underneath the water medium. The following conclusions were reached: (1) The interaction fractions decreased in the following order: 16O > 12C > 14N > 1H. Bulges in the interaction fractions (versus water medium thickness) were observed, which reflected changes in the energies of the propagating photons due to traversals of different amount of water medium as well as changes in the energy-dependent photon interaction cross-sections. (2) Photoelectric interaction and incoherent scattering dominated for lower-energy (10 keV) and high-energy (100 keV and 1 MeV) incident photons. (3) The fractions of electron ejection from different nuclei were mainly governed by the photoelectric effect cross-sections, and the fractions from the 1s subshell were the largest. (4) The penetration fractions in general decreased with increasing medium thickness, and increased with increasing incident photon energy, the latter being explained by the corresponding reduction in interaction cross-sections. (5) The areas under the angular distribution curves of photons exiting the medium layer and subsequently undergoing interactions within the cell layer became smaller for larger incident photon energies. (6) The number of cells suffering at least one electron hit increased with the administered dose. For larger incident photon energies, the numbers of cells suffering at least one electron hit became smaller, which was attributed to the reduction in the photon interaction cross-section. These results highlighted the importance of the administered dose in radiobiological experiments. In particular, the threshold administered doses at which all cells in the exposed cell array suffered at least one electron hit might provide hints on explaining the intriguing observation that radiation-induced cancers can be statistically detected only above the threshold value of ~100 mSv, and thus on reconciling controversies over the linear no-threshold model.","['1 Department of Physics, City University of Hong Kong, Tat Chee Avenue, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong.', '2 Faculty of Science, University of Kragujevac, Kragujevac, Serbia.']","Mehrdad Shahmohammadi Beni, D Krstic, D Nikezic, K N Yu, ",PloS one,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29561871

We report the fabrication and characterization of an optical sensor based on a Mach-Zehnder interferometer to monitor the growing concentration of bacteria in a liquid medium. The device pattern was imprinted on transparent self-patternable organic-inorganic di-ureasil hybrid films by direct UV-laser, reducing the complexity and cost production compared with lithographic techniques or three-dimensional (3D) patterning using femtosecond lasers. The sensor performance was evaluated using, as an illustrative example, E. coli cell growth in an aqueous medium. The measured sensitivity (2 × 10-4 RIU) and limit of detection (LOD = 2 × 10-4) are among the best values known for low-refractive index contrast sensors. Furthermore, the di-ureasil hybrid used to produce this biosensor has additional advantages, such as mechanical flexibility, thermal stability, and low insertion losses due to fiber-device refractive index mismatch (~1.49). Therefore, the proposed sensor constitutes a direct, compact, fast, and cost-effective solution for monitoring the concentration of lived-cells.","['1 Department of Physics and CICECO-Aveiro Institute of Materials, University of Aveiro, 3810-193 Aveiro, Portugal. rita.bastos@ua.pt.', '2 Instituto de Telecomunicações, University of Aveiro, 3810-193 Aveiro, Portugal. rita.bastos@ua.pt.', '3 Department of Electronics, Telecommunications and Informatics, University of Aveiro, 3810-193 Aveiro, Portugal. rita.bastos@ua.pt.', '4 Department of Physics and CICECO-Aveiro Institute of Materials, University of Aveiro, 3810-193 Aveiro, Portugal. cvicente@av.it.pt.', '5 Instituto de Telecomunicações, University of Aveiro, 3810-193 Aveiro, Portugal. cvicente@av.it.pt.', '6 Department of Physics and CICECO-Aveiro Institute of Materials, University of Aveiro, 3810-193 Aveiro, Portugal. ruipedro.silva@ua.pt.', '7 Department of Physics and CICECO-Aveiro Institute of Materials, University of Aveiro, 3810-193 Aveiro, Portugal. nunojoao@ua.pt.', '8 Department of Biology and CESAM, University of Aveiro, 3810-193 Aveiro, Portugal. martat@ua.pt.', '9 Department of Chemistry and CESAM, University of Aveiro, 3810-193 Aveiro, Portugal. jpintocosta@ua.pt.', '10 Instituto de Telecomunicações, University of Aveiro, 3810-193 Aveiro, Portugal. mlima@ua.pt.', '11 Department of Electronics, Telecommunications and Informatics, University of Aveiro, 3810-193 Aveiro, Portugal. mlima@ua.pt.', '12 Department of Electric and Computer Engineering and Instituto de Telecomunicações, Instituto Superior Técnico, Universidade de Lisboa, 1049-001 Lisbon, Portugal. paulo.andre@lx.it.pt.', '13 Department of Physics and CICECO-Aveiro Institute of Materials, University of Aveiro, 3810-193 Aveiro, Portugal. rferreira@ua.pt.']","Ana R Bastos, Carlos M S Vicente, Rui Oliveira-Silva, Nuno J O Silva, Marta Tacão, João P da Costa, Mário Lima, Paulo S André, Rute A S Ferreira, ","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2018,E. coli; biosensors; integrated optics; organic-inorganic hybrid; photonic; sol-gel.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29534514

      Use optical modeling to evaluate the effect of the intraocular lens (IOL) optic-haptic junction on retinal illumination and negative dysphotopsia. Setting:
      
    

    
      Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA. Design:
      
    

    
      Schematic model eye. Methods:
      
    

    
      Ray-tracing software for an extended light source was used to simulate retina illumination in a pseudophakic eye with a biconvex high-index acrylic IOL and a 2.5 mm pupil. The haptic junction was modeled using an annular cone of haptic material of 0.75 mm width located between the optic and haptic. Ray-tracing diagrams and simulated retina illumination profiles were compared with and without the haptic junction. Retinal locations were scaled to visual angles from 70 to 110 degrees horizontally. Results:
      
    

    
      Light incident on the peripheral optic creates a nonuniform retina illumination pattern consisting of a 5-degree band of nonilluminated retina bounded posteriorly by light refracted by the optic and anteriorly by light that missed the optic. Light incident on the haptic junction illuminates retina differently in that light that typically misses the optic (input angle 79 to 91 degrees) is instead refracted at a large angle or internally reflected by the haptic junction, which removes the illuminated peripheral retina that would otherwise delineate the shadow region. Further modification to the haptic junction region improved peripheral retina illumination and shifted the shadow region 10 degrees anteriorly. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The haptic junction illuminated the peripheral retina differently than the peripheral optic, and this might explain why a horizontal haptic junction minimizes negative dysphotopsia. A modification to the optic-haptic junction redirected illumination and shifted the retina shadow anteriorly, possibly decreasing awareness.","['1 Department of Ophthalmology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.

      Over the 14-week period, the mean and standard deviation background-corrected dose for the passively scattered proton RTTs was 39.9 ± 5.4 mrem. The mean and standard deviation background-corrected dose for the conventional photon RTTs was similar at 39.9 ± 9.0 mrem (P = .6). Exposure rates were lower in equipment activated in a scanning beam system in comparison with those from a passive scatter system. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Radiation dose to passively scattered proton and photon radiation therapy technologists was similar when measured with a dosimeter worn at the waist over a period of 14 weeks. On the basis of these data, the departmental policy permits pregnant radiation workers to work in proton treatment areas, and the policy for pregnant workers does not differ between proton and photon radiation workers or between passive scatter and scanning beam systems. All employees are encouraged to limit time near and proximity to activated equipment.","['1 Department of Radiation Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', '2 Department of Radiation Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.

313,Estimation of photoneutron dosimetric characteristics in tissues/organs using an improved simple model of linac head,"Neutrons as a one of the by-products of high-energy photons in radiotherapy increase the patient's risks and could cause secondary cancers. Therefore, a new corrected simplified model for linac head was introduced to calculate equivalent (H) and absorbed (D) doses in different tissues/organs of a phantom model. The photoneutron spectrum calculated with this model was in agreement with the spectrum obtained by using a detailed linac´s head model having all components. Besides, an anthropomorphic phantom was irradiated under different gantry angles of the corrected simplified model aiming to emulate 15, 18, 20, and 25MV Siemens linacs. The results indicated that tissues which were within the treatment field received more dose than others. Furthermore, tissues which were in the vicinity of each other and the same depth in the phantom nearly received the same doses. Finally, fatal secondary cancer risk was also studied.","['1 Physics Department, Faculty of Sciences, Golestan University, Gorgan 49138-15739, Iran.

In this Letter, we first theoretically and experimentally investigate the formation of high-quality photonic nanojets by decorating spider silk. The dragline silks are directly extracted from cellar spiders and capable of efficiently collecting ultraviolet cure adhesive. The liquid-collecting capacity of the captured silk is the result of a singular fiber structure with periodic spindle knots. Using a scanning-optical-microscope system, we show that high-quality photonic nanojets are generated by silk fiber with spindle knots. With the variation in spindle-knot dimensions, the properties of photonic nanojets, such as intensity distribution, focal length, and full width at half-maximum, are able to tune flexibly. By combining the unique biocompatibility, flexibility, and tensile strength, the silk filaments with spindle knots pave a potential way for original bio-photonic applications.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"C B Lin, Zih-Huan Huang, Cheng-Yang Liu, ",Optics letters,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30702706
316,A New Approach for the Calculation of Total Corneal Astigmatism Considering the Magnitude and Orientation of Posterior Corneal Astigmatism and Thickness,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      To evaluate a new method of calculation of total corneal astigmatism based on Gaussian optics and the power design of a spherocylindrical lens (C) in the healthy eye and to compare it with keratometric (K) and power vector (PV) methods. Methods:
      
    

    
      A total of 92 healthy eyes of 92 patients (age, 17-65 years) were enrolled. Corneal astigmatism was calculated in all cases using K, PV, and our new approach C that considers the contribution of corneal thickness. An evaluation of the interchangeability of our new approach with the other 2 methods was performed using Bland-Altman analysis. Results:
      
    

    
      Statistically significant differences between methods were found in the magnitude of astigmatism (P < 0.001), with the highest values provided by K. These differences in the magnitude of astigmatism were clinically relevant when K and C were compared [limits of agreement (LoA), -0.40 to 0.62 D), but not for the comparison between PV and C (LoA, -0.03 to 0.01 D). Differences in the axis of astigmatism between methods did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.408). However, they were clinically relevant when comparing K and C (LoA, -5.48 to 15.68 degrees) but not for the comparison between PV and C (LoA, -1.68 to 1.42 degrees). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The use of our new approach for the calculation of total corneal astigmatism provides astigmatic results comparable to the PV method, which suggests that the effect of pachymetry on total corneal astigmatism is minimal in healthy eyes.","['1 Group of Optics and Visual Perception, Department of Optics, Pharmacology and Anatomy, University of Alicante, Alicante, Spain.', '2 Department of Ophthalmology (OFTALMAR), Vithas Medimar International Hospital, Alicante, Spain.']","David P Piñero, María T Caballero, Juan M Nicolás-Albujer, Dolores de Fez, Vicent J Camps, ",Cornea,2018 Jun,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29538100

By utilizing Mie-resonant metamaterials with high refractive index, we demonstrate photonic waveguides and cavities with strong robustness to position disorder, thus providing a novel approach to the band-gap-based nanophotonic devices with new properties and functionalities.","['1 School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, United Kingdom.', '2 Chair in Hybrid Nanosystems, Nanoinstitute Munich, Faculty of Physics, Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich, 80539 Munich, Germany.', '3 ITMO University, St Petersburg 197101, Russia.', '4 Ioffe Institute, St Petersburg 194021, Russia.', '5 College of Electronic and Optical Engineering and College of Microelectronics, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing 210023, China.', '6 Nonlinear Physics Centre, Australian National University, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.']","Changxu Liu, Mikhail V Rybin, Peng Mao, Shuang Zhang, Yuri Kivshar, ",Physical review letters,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31702361
318,Detecting a Zeptogram of Pyridine with a Hybrid Plasmonic-Photonic Nanosensor,"Thanks to their small sensing volume, nanosensors based on localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPR) allow the detection of minute amounts of analytes, down to the single-molecule limit. However, the detected analytes are often large molecules, such as proteins. The detection of small molecules remains largely unexplored. Here, we use a hybrid photonic-plasmonic nanosensor to detect a small target molecule (pyridine). The sensor's design is based on a dielectric photonic microstructure acting as an antenna, which efficiently funnels light toward a plasmonic transducer and enhances the detection efficiency. This sensor exhibits a limit of detection as small as 10-14 mol L-1. Using a calibration procedure based on electrodynamical numerical simulations, we compute the number of detected molecules. This yields a limit of detection in mass of 4 zeptograms (1 zg = 10-21 g), a record value for plasmonic molecular sensors. Our system can hence be seen as an optical molecular weighing scale, enabling room temperature detection of mass at the zeptogram scale.","['1 Light, Nanomaterials, Nanotechnologies (L2n) , Institut Charles Delaunay, CNRS, Université de Technologie de Troyes , 10000 Troyes CEDEX , France.']","Julien Proust, Jérôme Martin, Davy Gérard, Jean-Louis Bijeon, Jérôme Plain, ",ACS sensors,2019,limit of detection; molecular weighing scales; nanosensors; optical antennas; pyridine; surface plasmons.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30735031
319,Relative efficiency of Gafchromic EBT3 and MD-V3 films exposed to low-energy photons and its influence on the energy dependence,"Energy-dependence of Gafchromic films exposed to low-energy photons has been reported to be a function of absorbed-dose. However, these studies are based on a relative-response, R, which considers the absorbed-dose in water and not within the film sensitive-volume. This work investigated the relative-efficiency, REfilm, (ratio of absorbed-dose required to produce the same net optical density (netOD) by 60Co gamma and by x-ray) of Gafchromic EBT3 and MD-V3 films exposed to five x-ray beams from 20 kV to 160 kV and 60Co gamma rays. A factor that accounts for the energy-dependence, fx,Q,med, based on REfilm, phantom-material and depth at which the films are placed during irradiation was used to remove the influence of absorbed dose. Values of REfilm indicated that the absorbed dose from 60Co gamma rays needs to be 4 and 3 times larger than those from 20 kV x-rays to produce the same netOD within the EBT3 and MD-V3 sensitive volumes, respectively. Thus, saturation could help explain why Gafchromic films show under-response to very low doses from low-energy photon beams, regardless of film model. Furthermore, REfilm, was found to be nearly independent of netOD and colour-channels. Consequently, fx,Q,med is independent of the absorbed dose and colour-channels. In contrast, besides the variation with the photon energy, fx,Q,med varied with film model, depth and phantom material used during the irradiation. Thus, the results suggest that fx,Q,med is a more reliable wide-ranging parameter for evaluating the degree of energy-dependence of the film rather than the relative-response method commonly considered.","['1 Instituto de Física, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, 04510 Coyoacan, Mexico City, Mexico.

320,Spiraling contaminant electrons increase doses to surfaces outside the photon beam of an MRI-linac with a perpendicular magnetic field,"The transverse magnetic field of an MRI-linac sweeps contaminant electrons away from the radiation beam. Films oriented perpendicular to the magnetic field and 5 cm from the radiation beam edge show a projection of the divergent beam, indicating that contaminant electrons spiral along magnetic field lines and deposit dose on surfaces outside the primary beam perpendicular to the magnetic field. These spiraling contaminant electrons (SCE) could increase skin doses to protruding regions of the patient along the cranio-caudal axis. This study investigated doses from SCE for an MRI-linac comprising a 7 MV linac and a 1.5 T MRI scanner. Surface doses to films perpendicular to the magnetic field and 5 cm from the radiation beam edge showed increased dose within the projection of the primary beam, whereas films parallel to the magnetic field and 5 cm from the beam edge showed no region of increased dose. However, the dose from contaminant electrons is absorbed within a few millimeters. For large fields, the SCE dose is within the same order of magnitude as doses from scattered and leakage photons. Doses for both SCE and scattered photons decrease rapidly with decreasing beam size and increasing distance from the beam edge.","['1 Department of Radiotherapy, UMC Utrecht, Heidelberglaan 100, Utrecht, Netherlands.']","S L Hackett, B van Asselen, J W H Wolthaus, J J Bluemink, K Ishakoglu, J Kok, J J W Lagendijk, B W Raaymakers, ",Physics in medicine and biology,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29595150

      Recognising prematurity is critical in order to attend to immediate needs in childbirth settings, guiding the extent of medical care provided for newborns. A new medical device has been developed to carry out the preemie-test, an innovative approach to estimate gestational age (GA), based on the photobiological properties of the newborn's skin. First, this study will validate the preemie-test for GA estimation at birth and its accuracy to detect prematurity. Second, the study intends to associate the infant's skin reflectance with lung maturity, as well as evaluate safety, precision and usability of a new medical device to offer a suitable product for health professionals during childbirth and in neonatal care settings. Methods and analysis:
      
    

    
      Research protocol for diagnosis, single-group, single-blinding and single-arm multicenter clinical trial with a reference standard. Alive newborns, with 24 weeks or more of pregnancy age, will be enrolled during the first 24 hours of life. Sample size is 787 subjects. The primary outcome is the difference between the GA calculated by the photobiological neonatal skin assessment methodology and the GA calculated by the comparator antenatal ultrasound or reliable last menstrual period (LMP). Immediate complications caused by pulmonary immaturity during the first 72 hours of life will be associated with skin reflectance in a nested case-control study.

This technology is required in certain implantable neural prostheses that demand the transmission of optical signals through an encapsulating material, such as in retinal implants or in optogenetic applications. In this study, biocompatible film-type cyclic olefin polymers (COPs) with low moisture absorption (<; 0.01 %) and high light transmission (92 %) are utilized as encapsulating materials based on thermal lamination. The reliability of COP encapsulation is characterized through accelerated soak tests in a 75 °C saline solution to measure the leakage currents from encapsulated inter-digitated electrodes. These tests had been done for 211 days with the estimated lifetime of 8.05 years at 37 °C. In addition, the optical properties of a thermally laminated COP film sample in relation to its thickness are evaluated by an experimental setup which uses projected line patterns on an image sensor. The light transmittance of COP film samples thinner than 376 μm exceeded 91.69 %, and the minimum distinguishable line pitch was 47.6 μm at a thickness of 26 μm.

      To find a simple model for the frequency-dependent detective quantum efficiency (DQE) of photon-counting detectors in the low flux limit. Methods:
      
    

    
      Formula for the spatial cross-talk, the noise power spectrum and the DQE of a photon-counting detector working at a given threshold are derived. Parameters are probabilities for types of events like single counts in the central pixel, double counts in the central pixel and a neighboring pixel or single count in a neighboring pixel only. These probabilities can be derived in a simple model by extensive use of Monte Carlo techniques: The Monte Carlo x-ray propagation program MOCASSIM is used to simulate the energy deposition from the x-rays in the detector material. A simple charge cloud model using Gaussian clouds of fixed width is used for the propagation of the electric charge generated by the primary interactions. Both stages are combined in a Monte Carlo simulation randomizing the location of impact which finally produces the required probabilities. The parameters of the charge cloud model are fitted to the spectral response to a polychromatic spectrum measured with our prototype detector. Results:
      
    

    
      Based on the Monte Carlo model, the DQE of photon-counting detectors as a function of spatial frequency is calculated for various pixel sizes, photon energies, and thresholds. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The frequency-dependent DQE of a photon-counting detector in the low flux limit can be described with an equation containing only a small set of probabilities as input.

However, most reported techniques suffer from drawbacks such as long time, expensive equipment and complicated testing process, which prevent the use of real-time application. Herein, we demonstrate a novel liquid crystal optical sensor for detection of Pb2+ based on DNAzyme and its combined strand. The ordered and disordered configuration of liquid crystals, induced by complementary DNA strand and catalytically cleaved DNA in presence of lead ion separately, leads to dark and bright optical image under POM. The proposed naked-eye optical sensor possesses an extremely broad detection range of Pb2+ from 50 nM to 500 µM, with a low detection limit about 36.8 nM. The sensor also demonstrates high selectivity of Pb2+ from many other metal ions.

330,Intraframe motion correction for raster-scanned adaptive optics images using strip-based cross-correlation lag biases,"In retinal raster imaging modalities, fixational eye movements manifest as image warp, where the relative positions of the beam and retina change during the acquisition of single frames. To remove warp artifacts, strip-based registration methods-in which fast-axis strips from target images are registered to a reference frame-have been applied in adaptive optics (AO) scanning light ophthalmoscopy (SLO) and optical coherence tomography (OCT). This approach has enabled object tracking and frame averaging, and methods have been described to automatically select reference frames with minimal motion. However, inconspicuous motion artifacts may persist in reference frames and propagate themselves throughout the processes of registration, tracking, and averaging. Here we test a previously proposed method for removing movement artifacts in reference frames, using biases in stripwise cross-correlation statistics. We applied the method to synthetic retinal images with simulated eye motion artifacts as well as real AO-SLO images of the cone mosaic and volumetric AO-OCT images, both affected by eye motion. In the case of synthetic images, the method was validated by direct comparison with motion-free versions of the images. In the case of real AO images, performance was validated by comparing the correlation of uncorrected images with that of corrected images, by quantifying the effect of motion artifacts on the image power spectra, and by qualitative examination of AO-OCT B-scans and en face projections. In all cases, the proposed method reduced motion artifacts and produced more faithful images of the retina.","['1 Vision Science and Advanced Retinal Imaging Laboratory (VSRI), Department of Ophthalmology and Vision Science, UC Davis Eye Center, Sacramento, CA, United States of America.', '2 Department of Physics, Astronomy and Informatics, Nicolaus Copernicus University, Torun, Poland.']","Mehdi Azimipour, Robert J Zawadzki, Iwona Gorczynska, Justin Migacz, John S Werner, Ravi S Jonnal, ",PloS one,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30359401
331,The effective point of measurement for depth-dose measurements in small MV photon beams with different detectors,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      The effective point of measurement (EPOM) of cylindrical ionization chambers differs from their geometric center. The exact shift depends on chamber construction details, above all the chamber size, and to some degree on the field-size and beam quality. It generally decreases as the chamber dimensions get smaller. In this work, effective points of measurement in small photon fields of a range of cylindrical chambers of different sizes are investigated, including small chambers that have not been studied previously. Methods:
      
    

    
      In this investigation, effective points of measurement for different ionization chambers (Farmer type, scanning chambers, micro-ionization chambers) and solid state detectors were determined by measuring depth-ionization curves in a 6 MV beam in field sizes between 2 × 2 cm2 and 10 × 10 cm2 and comparing those curves with curves measured with plane-parallel chambers. Results:
      
    

    
      It was possible to average the results to one shift per detector, as the results were sufficiently independent of the studied field sizes. For cylindrical ion chambers, shifts of the EPOM were determined to be between 0.49 and 0.30 times the inner chamber radius from the reference point. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We experimentally confirmed the previously reported decrease of the EPOM shift with decreasing detector size. Highly accurate data for a large range of detectors, including new very small ones, were determined. Thus, small chambers noticeably differ from the 0.5-times to 0.6-times the inner chamber radius recommendations in current dosimetry protocols. The detector-individual EPOMs need to be considered for measurements of depth-dose curves.","['1 Radiation Oncology, University of Wuerzburg, Josef-Schneider-Str. 11, 97080, Wuerzburg, Germany.']","Sonja Wegener, Otto A Sauer, ",Medical physics,2019 Nov,depth dose curves; effective point of measurement; ionization chambers; micro-chambers.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31461533
332,Spatio-energetic cross-talk in photon counting detectors: Numerical detector model (PcTK) and workflow for CT image quality assessment,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      The interpixel cross-talk of energy-sensitive photon counting x-ray detectors (PCDs) has been studied and an analytical model (version 2.1) has been developed for double-counting between neighboring pixels due to charge sharing and K-shell fluorescence x-ray emission followed by its reabsorption (Taguchi K, et al., Medical Physics 2016;43(12):6386-6404). While the model version 2.1 simulated the spectral degradation well, it had the following problems that has been found to be significant recently: (1) The spectrum is inaccurate with smaller pixel sizes; (2) the charge cloud size must be smaller than the pixel size; (3) the model underestimates the spectrum/counts for 10-40 keV; and (4) the model version 2.1 cannot handlen-tuple-counting withn > 2 (i.e., triple-counting or higher). These problems are inherent to the design of the model version 2.1; therefore, we developed a new model and addressed these problems in this study. Methods:
      
    

    
      We propose a new PCD cross-talk model (version 3.2; Pc TK for ""photon counting toolkit"") that is based on a completely different design concept from the previous version. It uses a numerical approach and starts with a 2-D model of charge sharing (as opposed to an analytical approach and a 1-D model with version 2.1) and addresses all of the four problems. The model takes the following factors into account: (1) shift-variant electron density of the charge cloud (Gaussian-distributed), (2) detection efficiency, (3) interactions between photons and PCDs via photoelectric effect, and (4) electronic noise. Correlated noisy PCD data can be generated using either a multivariate normal random number generator or a Poisson random number generator. The effect of the two parameters, the effective charge cloud diameter (d0 ) and pixel size (dpix ), was studied and results were compared with Monte Carlo simulations and the previous model version 2.1. Finally, a script for the workflow for CT image quality assessment has been developed, which started with a few material density images, generated material-specific sinogram (line integrals) data, noisy PCD data with spectral distortion using the model version 3.2, and reconstructed PCD- CT images for four energy windows. Results:
      
    

    
      The model version 3.2 addressed all of the four problems listed above. The spectra withdpix = 56-113 μm agreed with that of Medipix3 detector withdpix = 55-110 μm without charge summing mode qualitatively. The counts for 10-40 keV were larger than the previous model (version 2.1) and agreed with MC simulations very well (root-mean-square difference values with model version 3.2 were decreased to 16%-67% of the values with version 2.1). There were many non-zero off-diagonal elements withn-tuple-counting withn > 2 in the normalized covariance matrix of 3 × 3 neighboring pixels. Reconstructed images showed biases and artifacts attributed to the spectral distortion due to the charge sharing and fluorescence x rays. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      We have developed a new PCD model for spatio-energetic cross-talk and correlation between PCD pixels. The workflow demonstrated the utility of the model for general or task-specific image quality assessments for the PCD- CT.Note: The program (Pc TK) and the workflow scripts have been made available to academic researchers.

334,Experimental Study of the Oriented Immobilization of Antibodies on Photonic Sensing Structures by Using Protein A as an Intermediate Layer,"A proper antibody immobilization on a biosensor is a crucial step in order to obtain a high sensitivity to be able to detect low target analyte concentrations. In this paper, we present an experimental study of the immobilization process of antibodies as bioreceptors on a photonic ring resonator sensor. A protein A intermediate layer was created on the sensor surface in order to obtain an oriented immobilization of the antibodies, which enhances the interaction with the target antigens to be detected. The anti-bovine serum albumin (antiBSA)-bovine serum albumin (BSA) pair was used as a model for our study. An opto-fluidic setup was developed in order to flow the different reagents and, simultaneously, to monitor in real-time the spectral response of the photonic sensing structure. The antiBSA immobilization and the BSA detection, their repeatability, and specificity were studied in different conditions of the sensor surface. Finally, an experimental limit of detection for BSA recognition of only 1 ng/mL was obtained.","['1 Nanophotonics Technology Center, Universitat Politècnica de València, Camino de Vera s/n, 46022 Valencia, Spain. rcaroselli@ntc.upv.es.', '2 Nanophotonics Technology Center, Universitat Politècnica de València, Camino de Vera s/n, 46022 Valencia, Spain. jagarcas@gmail.com.', '3 Centro de Reconocimiento Molecular y Desarrollo Tecnológico, Departamento de Química, Universitat Politècnica de València, 46022 Valencia, Spain. joresfu1@upvnet.upv.es.', '4 Centro de Reconocimiento Molecular y Desarrollo Tecnológico, Departamento de Química, Universitat Politècnica de València, 46022 Valencia, Spain. mbpolo@upvnet.upv.es.', '5 Centro de Reconocimiento Molecular y Desarrollo Tecnológico, Departamento de Química, Universitat Politècnica de València, 46022 Valencia, Spain. amaquieira@qim.upv.es.', '6 Nanophotonics Technology Center, Universitat Politècnica de València, Camino de Vera s/n, 46022 Valencia, Spain. jaigarru@ntc.upv.es.']","Raffaele Caroselli, Javier García Castelló, Jorge Escorihuela, María José Bañuls, Ángel Maquieira, Jaime García-Rupérez, ","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2018,Integrated photonics; biosensing; ring resonator; sensor.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29597326
335,Fast screening of antibiotics in milk using a molecularly imprinted two-dimensional photonic crystal hydrogel sensor,"As a typical antibiotic that is harmful to the health of human beings and widely used in animal husbandry, oxytetracycline (OTC) has a potential threat to the food safety. Therefore, the design of portable sensors for efficiently monitoring trace amounts of OTC in foods is vital to maintain safe food supply in our daily life. Herein, a two-dimensional (2D) molecularly imprinted photonic crystal hydrogel (MIPCH) sensor for the detection of OTC was fabricated by combining the photonic crystal (PC) method and molecular imprinting technique. In this regard, OTC was used as imprinted template to form the MIPCH sensor with specific binding sites during polymerization. After the removal of template, the obtained MIPCH possessed the specific nanocavities that were complementary to target compound, OTC. In addition, the response of the MIPCH to tetracyclines (TCs) in aqueous solution was monitored through a readable change of Debye diffraction ring, which is related to the particle spacing variation of MIPCH in response to the target molecules. As the concentration of OTC increased from 0 to 60 μM, the particle spacing of MIPCH sensor increased to about 94 nm and the structural color redshifted from blue to red. More importantly, the detection of OTC in milk sample by this portable, cost-effective MIPCH sensor has also been achieved at the same range of OTC. With the increasing concentration of OTC in milk sample, the particle spacing of MIPCH sensor increased about 92 nm and the structural color of MIPCH changed from blue through green to orange.","['1 School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, 100081, PR China.', '2 School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, 100081, PR China.

336,PRIMO Monte Carlo software benchmarked against a reference dosimetry dataset for 6 MV photon beams from Varian linacs,"Background:
      
    

    
      The software PRIMO for the Monte Carlo simulation of radiotherapy linacs could potentially act as a independent calculation system to verify the calculations of treatment planning systems. We investigated the suitability of the PRIMO default beam parameters to produce accurate dosimetric results for 6 MV photon beams from Varian Clinac 2100 linacs and 6 MV flattening-filter-free photon beams from Varian TrueBeam linacs. Methods:
      
    

    
      Simulation results with the DPM algorithm were benchmarked against a published reference dosimetry dataset based on point measurements of 25 dosimetric parameters on a large series of linacs. Studied parameters (for several field sizes and depths) were: PDD, off-axis ratios, and output factors for open fields and IMRT/SBRT-style fields. For the latter, the output factors were also determined with radiochromic film and with a small-sized ionization chamber. Benchmark data, PRIMO simulation results and our experimental results were compared. Results:
      
    

    
      PDD, off-axis ratios, and open-field output factors obtained from the simulations with the PRIMO default beam parameters agreed with the benchmark data within 2.4% for Clinac 2100, and within 1.3% for TrueBeam. Higher differences were found for IMRT/SBRT-style output factors: up to 2.8% for Clinac 2100, and up to 3.3% for TrueBeam. Experimental output factors agreed with benchmark data within 1.0% (ionization chamber) and within 1.9% (radiochromic film). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      PRIMO default initial beam parameters for 6 MV photon beams from Varian Clinac 2100 linacs and 6 MV FFF photon beams from Varian TrueBeam linacs allowed agreement within 3.3% with a dosimetry database based on measurements of a high number of linacs. This finding represents a first step in the validation of PRIMO for the independent verification of radiotherapy plans.","[""1 Servei de Física i Protecció Radiològica.

337,Michael-Addition-Mediated Photonic Crystals Allow Pretreatment-Free and Label-Free Sensoring of Ciprofloxacin in Fish Farming Water,"Abuse of antibiotics results in a large number of antibiotics residues in the environment and even causes the problem of ""super bacteria"". Therefore, it is crucial to develop a powerful analytic method to monitor antibiotics quickly and simply. Photonic crystal (PC), as a sensing material, has promising application prospects. Herein, we try to use PC to realize pretreatment-free and label-free detection of Ciprofloxacin (CF) through Michael addition reaction. The recognition process is carried out by the Michael addition reaction between the piperazine group of CF and the o-benzoquinone group on the PC. The monodisperse microspheres with o-benzoquinone groups are prepared by polymerization and oxidation and then stacked to form PC. During the detection, the peak intensity of the PC decreases with the increasing CF concentration, and the linear range is from 2 to 512 μg/L. The limit of detection (LOD) is 0.76 μg/L. Furthermore, the PC retains 97% of the initial response after storage in a Petri dish at room temperature for 1 month, which shows that it has good stability. Moreover, CF in fish farming water can be detected directly without any pretreatment and label, and the results are in good accordance with the LC-MS-MS results. This Michael-addition-mediated PC is accurate, easily prepared, cost-efficient, and long-term stable. In addition, it is environmentally friendly, because little organic solvent is needed during both the preparation and the detection.","[""1 College of Food Science and Engineering, Shandong Agricultural University , Tai'an 271018, P.

338,Brain Reward Circuit and Pain,"Pain plays an important role in alerting the body to potential tissue injury and drives behavior that protects the body from further harm. In contrast, chronic pain does not serve this function and instead only provides a persistent sensation of pain and a negative experience. The mesolimbic dopaminergic system has been recognized to play a central role in motivated behaviors, including various types of reward and pleasure. Many dopaminergic neurons may release multiple neurotransmitters, and the physiological role of the co-release of these transmitters has been revealed incrementally. However, it was not yet clear whether the mesolimbic dopaminergic system and small molecules released in the nucleus accumbens (N.Acc.), the input region of mesolimbic dopaminergic neurons, are involved in pain modulation. Recently, we revealed that the mesolimbic dopaminergic system and small molecules released in the N.Acc. could contribute to pain modulation. In this review, we provide an overview of the relationship between pain and the brain reward circuit using a combination of optogenetics, electrophysiology, and in vivo microdialysis/mass spectrometry integrated system.","['1 Department of Pharmacology, Hoshi University School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tokyo, Japan.', '2 Department of Pharmacology, Hoshi University School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tokyo, Japan. narita@hoshi.ac.jp.', '3 Life Science Tokyo Advanced Research Center (L-StaR), Hoshi University School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tokyo, Japan. narita@hoshi.ac.jp.']","Moe Watanabe, Minoru Narita, ",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,2018,Dopamine; Morphine; Nucleus accumbens; Ventral tegmental area.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30306526

The octagonal QPC biosensors are composed of silicon columns arranged in a liquid background. By designing a defect structure, a variety of localized modes with different spatial symmetries and field profiles are obtained, and a maximum refractive index sensitivity 800 nm/RIU is achieved around 1500 nm transmission peak when the central rod's size equals 100 nm, and the corresponding detection limit reaches 0.00042. The liquid can flow freely among the rods through the entire structure, so it is convenient to monitor the concentration of protein in the liquid environment dynamically. The influence of the protein's thickness to the shift of the resonant wavelength is also studied, where a minimum protein's thickness of less than 10 nm can be detected by optimizing the central column's size to be 400 nm, and the spatial field profiles of different resonant modes are analyzed to explain the corresponding sensitivities.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Xiaoqing Wang, Lin Zhou, Tingting Zhao, Xing Liu, Shuai Feng, Xiao Chen, Honglian Guo, Chuanbo Li, Yiquan Wang, ",Applied optics,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31044889

To overcome this problem, we developed a method utilizing the unfolding transformation which analyzes the energy level statistics in the random matrix theory. We regarded the energy axis as time axis of neuron spike and analyzed the time series of cortical neural firing in vivo. Unfolding transformation detected regularities of neural firing while changes in firing densities were associated with pentobarbital.

342,Determination of the active volumes of solid-state photon-beam dosimetry detectors using the PTB proton microbeam,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      This study aims at the experimental determination of the diameters and thicknesses of the active volumes of solid-state photon-beam detectors for clinical dosimetry. The 10 MeV proton microbeam of the PTB (Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt, Braunschweig) was used to examine two synthetic diamond detectors, type microDiamond (PTW Freiburg, Germany), and the silicon detectors Diode E (PTW Freiburg, Germany) and Razor Diode (Iba Dosimetry, Germany). The knowledge of the dimensions of their active volumes is essential for their Monte Carlo simulation and their applications in small-field photon-beam dosimetry. Methods:
      
    

    
      The diameter of the active detector volume was determined from the detector current profile recorded by radially scanning the proton microbeam across the detector. The thickness of the active detector volume was determined from the detector's electrical current, the number of protons incident per time interval and their mean stopping power in the active volume. The mean energy of the protons entering this volume was assessed by comparing the measured and the simulated influence of the thickness of a stack of aluminum preabsorber foils on the detector signal. Results:
      
    

    
      For all detector types investigated, the diameters measured for the active volume closely agreed with the manufacturers' data. For the silicon Diode E detector, the thickness determined for the active volume agreed with the manufacturer's data, while for the microDiamond detectors and the Razor Diode, the thicknesses measured slightly exceeded those stated by the manufacturers. Discussion:
      
    

    
      The PTB microbeam facility was used to analyze the diameters and thicknesses of the active volumes of photon dosimetry detectors for the first time. A new method of determining the thickness values with an uncertainty of ±10% was applied. The results appear useful for further consolidating detailed geometrical knowledge of the solid-state detectors investigated, which are used in clinical small-field photon-beam dosimetry.","['1 University Clinic for Medical Radiation Physics, Medical Campus Pius-Hospital, Carl von Ossietzky University, Oldenburg, Germany.', '2 Radiotherapy Department, Imland Hospital, Rendsburg, Germany.', '3 Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), Bundesallee 100, Braunschweig, 38116, Germany.', '4 Prof. em., Medical Physics and Biophysics, Georg August University, Göttingen, Germany.']","Daniela Poppinga, Bjoern Delfs, Jutta Meyners, Frank Langner, Ulrich Giesen, Dietrich Harder, Bjoern Poppe, Hui K Looe, ",Medical physics,2018 Jul,active detector volume; dosimetry; solid-state detector.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29727482

These detectors are designed to operate in a wide dynamic range from the level of spontaneous emission to the SASE saturation level (between a few nJ up to 25 mJ), in a wide wavelength range from 0.05 nm to 0.4 nm for SASE1 and SASE2, and from 0.4 nm to 4.43 nm for SASE3. The detectors measure photon pulse energies with an anode and a photodiode. The photon beam image is observed with an MCP imager with a phosphor screen. At present, the SASE1 and SASE3 MCP detectors are commissioned with XFEL beams. Calibration and first measurements of photon radiation in multibunch mode are performed with the SASE1 and SASE3 MCPs.

344,A novel simplistic fabrication technique for cranial epidural electrodes for chronic recording and stimulation in rats,"Background:
      
    

    
      The demand for neuromodulatory and recording tools has resulted in a surge of publications describing techniques for fabricating devices and accessories in-house suitable for neurological recordings. However, many of these fabrication protocols use equipment which are not common to biological laboratories, thus limiting researchers to the use of commercial alternatives. New method:We have developed a simple yet robust implantable stimulating surface electrode which can be fabricated in all wet-bench laboratories. Results:
      
    

    
      Female Sprague-Dawley rats received epidural implantation of the electrodes over the fore and hind limb areas of their motor cortex. Stimulation of the motor cortex successfully evoked fore- and hind limb motor outputs. The device was also able to record surface potentials of the motor cortex following epidural stimulation of the spinal cord. Comparisons with existing methods:For stimulation of the motor cortex, often stiff stainless or copper wires are roughly tucked underneath the skull, with little accuracy of localization. While, commercially available devices utilize burr holes and screw electrodes. Our new electrode design provides us stereotaxic accuracy that was not previously available.

345,Characterization of photon-counting multislit breast tomosynthesis,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      It has been shown that breast tomosynthesis may improve sensitivity and specificity compared to two-dimensional mammography, resulting in increased detection-rate of cancers or lowered call-back rates. The purpose of this study is to characterize a spectral photon-counting multislit breast tomosynthesis system that is able to do single-scan spectral imaging with multiple collimated x-ray beams. The system differs in many aspects compared to conventional tomosynthesis using energy-integrating flat-panel detectors. Methods:
      
    

    
      The investigated system was a prototype consisting of a dual-threshold photon-counting detector with 21 collimated line detectors scanning across the compressed breast. A review of the system is done in terms of detector, acquisition geometry, and reconstruction methods. Three reconstruction methods were used, simple back-projection, filtered back-projection and an iterative algebraic reconstruction technique. The image quality was evaluated by measuring the modulation transfer-function (MTF), normalized noise-power spectrum, detective quantum-efficiency (DQE), and artifact spread-function (ASF) on reconstructed spectral tomosynthesis images for a total-energy bin (defined by a low-energy threshold calibrated to remove electronic noise) and for a high-energy bin (with a threshold calibrated to split the spectrum in roughly equal parts). Acquisition was performed using a 29 kVp W/Al x-ray spectrum at a 0.24 mGy exposure. Results:
      
    

    
      The difference in MTF between the two energy bins was negligible, that is, there was no energy dependence on resolution. The MTF dropped to 50% at 1.5 lp/mm to 2.3 lp/mm in the scan direction and 2.4 lp/mm to 3.3 lp/mm in the slit direction, depending on the reconstruction method. The full width at half maximum of the ASF was found to range from 13.8 mm to 18.0 mm for the different reconstruction methods. The zero-frequency DQE of the system was found to be 0.72. The fraction of counts in the high-energy bin was measured to be 59% of the total detected spectrum. Scantimes ranged from 4 s to 16.5 s depending on voltage and current settings. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The characterized system generates spectral tomosynthesis images with a dual-energy photon-counting detector. Measurements show a high DQE, enabling high image quality at a low dose, which is beneficial for low-dose applications such as screening. The single-scan spectral images open up for applications such as quantitative material decomposition and contrast-enhanced tomosynthesis.","['1 Physics of Medical Imaging, Royal Institute of Technology, AlbaNova University Center, 106 91, Stockholm, Sweden.', '2 Philips Mammography Solutions, 164 40, Kista, Sweden.']","Karl Berggren, Björn Cederström, Mats Lundqvist, Erik Fredenberg, ",Medical physics,2018 Feb,ASF; DQE; MTF; photon-counting; spectral imaging; tomosynthesis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29159881
346,Assessment of ion recombination correction and polarity effects for specific ionization chambers in flattening-filter-free photon beams,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      To investigate ion recombination correction and polarity effects in four ion chamber models in flattening-filter-free (FFF) beams to (1) evaluate their suitability for reference dosimetry; (2) assess the accuracy of the two-voltage technique (TVA) against the Bruggmoser formalism; and (3) examine the influence of the accelerator type on the recombination correction. Methods:
      
    

    
      Jaffé plots were created for a variety of microchambers, small-volume and Farmer-type chambers to obtain kS, the recombination correction factor, using two different types of accelerators. These values were plotted against dose-per-pulse and Jaffé plots for opposite polarities were created to determine which chambers meet the AAPM TG-51 addendum recombination and polarity specifications. Results:
      
    

    
      Nearly all small-volume chambers exhibited reference-class behavior with respect to ion recombination and polarity effects. The microchambers exhibited anomalous recombination and polarity effects, precluding their use for reference dosimetry in FFF beams. For the reference-class chambers, agreement between TVA-determined kS values and Jaffé and Bruggmoser formalisms-determined kS values was within 0.1%. No significant differences were found between the kS values obtained with the two different accelerators used in this work. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      This study stresses the need to characterize ion recombination correction and polarity effects for small-volume chambers and microchambers on an individual chamber basis and with the more rigorous criteria of the AAPM TG-51 addendum. Furthermore, the study demonstrated the suitability of the TVA method for chambers that exhibit reference-class behavior in FFF beams. Finally, this work has shown that the recombination correction does not depend on the type of accelerator but on its dose-per-pulse.","['1 Medical Physics and Radiation Protection Service, Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada, C/ Camino del Molino 2, 28492 Fuenlabrada, Madrid, Spain.

Thanks to the careful design of the nonuniform holes of NUPhCW with a feedback loop, the Autler-Townes splitting occurs in our device, and the spacing of two splitting resonance modes changes with the environmental refractive index, which is beneficial for achieving biosensing scenarios. Further, this integrated structure allows for self-referencing detection for immunity against environmental noise. Sensitivity of the NUPhCW is achieved at ∼117 nm/RIU, which is 2.6 times more than that of the common microring resonator, indicating that our proposed device structure would be promising for high-quality optical label-free sensing.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Guohui Yuan, Fangcao Peng, Lei Guan, Zhenming Peng, Zhuoran Wang, ",Applied optics,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30129591

349,Time-resolved Photophysical Characterization of Triplet-harvesting Organic Compounds at an Oxygen-free Environment Using an iCCD Camera,"Here, we present a sensible method of the acquisition and analysis of time-resolved photoluminescence using an ultrafast iCCD camera. This system enables the acquisition of photoluminescence spectra covering the time regime from nanoseconds up to 0.1 s. This enables us to follow the changes in the intensity (decay) and emission of the spectra over time. Using this method, it is possible to study diverse photophysical phenomena, such as the emission of phosphorescence, and the contributions of prompt and delayed fluorescence in molecules showing thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Remarkably, all spectra and decays are obtained in a single experiment. This can be done for solids (thin film, powder, crystal) and liquid samples, where the only limitations are the spectral sensitivity of the camera and the excitation wavelength (532 nm, 355 nm, 337 nm, and 266 nm). This technique is, thus, very important when investigating the excited state dynamics in organic emitters for their application in organic light-emitting diodes and other areas where triplet harvesting is of paramount importance. Since triplet states are strongly quenched by oxygen, emitters with efficient TADF luminescence, or those showing room temperature phosphorescence (RTP), must be correctly prepared in order to remove any dissolved oxygen from solutions and films. Otherwise, no long-lived emission will be observed. The method of degassing solid samples as presented in this work is basic and simple, but the degassing of liquid samples creates additional difficulties and is particularly interesting. A method of minimizing solvent loss and changing the sample concentration, while still enabling to remove oxygen in a very efficient and a repeatable manner, is presented in this work.","['1 Department of Physics, University of Durham; piotr.h.pander@durham.ac.uk.', '2 Department of Physics, University of Durham; Faculty of Chemistry, Silesian University of Technology; Center of Polymer and Carbon Materials, Polish Academy of Sciences.', '3 Department of Physics, University of Durham.']","Piotr Pander, Przemyslaw Data, Fernando B Dias, ",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30638200
350,Improved single photon time resolution for analog SiPMs with front end readout that reduces influence of electronic noise,"A key step to improve the coincidence time resolution of positron emission tomography detectors that exploit small populations of promptly emitted photons is improving the single photon time resolution (SPTR) of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). The influence of electronic noise has previously been identified as the dominant factor affecting SPTR for large area, analog SiPMs. In this work, we measure the achievable SPTR with front end electronic readout that minimizes the influence of electronic noise. With this readout circuit, the SPTR measured for one FBK NUV single avalanche photodiode (SPAD) was also achieved with a [Formula: see text] mm2 FBK NUV SiPM. SPTR for large area devices was also significantly improved. The measured SPTRs for [Formula: see text] mm2 Hamamatsu and SensL SiPMs were [Formula: see text]150 ps FWHM, and SPTR [Formula: see text]100 ps FWHM was measured for [Formula: see text] mm2 and [Formula: see text] mm2 FBK NUV and NUV-HD SiPMs. We also explore additional factors affecting the achievable SPTR for large area, analog SiPMs when the contribution of electronic noise is minimized and pinpoint potential areas of improvement to further reduce the SPTR of large area sensors towards that achievable for a single SPAD.","['1 Department of Radiology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America.']","Joshua W Cates, Stefan Gundacker, Etiennette Auffray, Paul Lecoq, Craig S Levin, ",Physics in medicine and biology,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30129562
351,A novel high-resolution 2D silicon array detector for small field dosimetry with FFF photon beams,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      Flattening filter free (FFF) beams are increasingly being considered for stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT). For the first time, the performance of a monolithic silicon array detector under 6 and 10 MV FFF beams was evaluated. The dosimeter, named ""Octa"" and designed by the Centre for Medical Radiation Physics (CMRP), was tested also under flattened beams for comparison. Methods:
      
    

    
      Output factors (OFs), percentage depth-dose (PDD), dose profiles (DPs) and dose per pulse (DPP) dependence were investigated. Results were benchmarked against commercially available detectors for small field dosimetry. Results:
      
    

    
      The dosimeter was shown to be a 'correction-free' silicon array detector for OFs and PDD measurements for all the beam qualities investigated. Measured OFs were accurate within 3% and PDD values within 2% compared against the benchmarks. Cross-plane, in-plane and diagonal DPs were measured simultaneously with high spatial resolution (0.3 mm) and real time read-out. A DPP dependence (24% at 0.021 mGy/pulse relative to 0.278 mGy/pulse) was found and could be easily corrected for in the case of machine specific quality assurance applications. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Results were consistent with those for monolithic silicon array detectors designed by the CMRP and previously characterized under flattened beams only, supporting the robustness of this technology for relative dosimetry for a wide range of beam qualities and dose per pulses. In contrast to its predecessors, the design of the Octa offers an exhaustive high-resolution 2D dose map characterization, making it a unique real-time radiation detector for small field dosimetry for field sizes up to 3 cm side.","['1 Centre for Medical Radiation Physics, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia.', '2 Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia.', '3 Centre for Medical Radiation Physics, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia; Illawarra Cancer Care Centre, Wollongong Hospital, Wollongong, NSW, Australia.', '4 SPA-BIT, Kiev, Ukraine.', '5 Centre for Medical Radiation Physics, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia; Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia; Sir Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute, University of Melbourne, Australia.', '6 Centre for Medical Radiation Physics, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia.

In this experiment, a focused laser beam pointing upwards levitate liquid droplets. The droplets are levitated by the photon pressure of the focused laser beam which balances the gravitational force. The diffraction pattern created when illuminated with laser light can help measure the size of a trapped droplet. The charge of the trapped droplet can be determined by studying its motion when a vertically directed electrical field is applied. There are several reasons motivating this experiment to be remotely controlled. The investments required for the setup exceeds the amount normally available in undergraduate teaching laboratories. The experiment requires a laser of Class 4, which is harmful to both skin and eyes and the experiment uses voltages that are harmful.","['1 Departamento de Informática y Automática, UNED; dgalan@dia.uned.es.', '2 Department of Physics, University of Gothenburg.', '3 Departamento de Informática y Automática, UNED.']","Daniel Galán, Oscar Isaksson, Jonas Enger, Mats Rostedt, Andreas Johansson, Dag Hanstorp, Luis de la Torre, ",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30688310
353,Monitoring kidney optical properties during cold storage preservation with spatial frequency domain imaging,"Transplantation of kidneys results in delayed graft function in as many as 40% of cases. During the organ transplantation process, donor kidneys undergo a period of cold ischemic time (CIT), where the organ is preserved with a cold storage solution to maintain tissue viability. Some complications observed after grafting may be due to damage sustained to the kidney during CIT. However, the effects due to this damage are not apparent until well after transplant surgery has concluded. To this end, we have used spatial frequency domain imaging (SFDI) to measure spatially resolved optical properties of porcine kidneys over the course of 80-h CIT. During this time, we observed an increase in both reduced scattering (<inline-formula>μs&'</inline-formula>) and absorption (μa) coefficients. The measured scattering b parameter increased until 24 h of CIT, then returned toward baseline during the remaining duration of the imaging sequence. These results show that the optical properties of kidney tissue change with increasing CIT and suggest that continued investigation into the application of SFDI to kidneys under CIT may lead to the development of a noninvasive method for assessing graft viability.","['1 Beckman Laser Institute and Medical Clinic, United States.', '2 Univ. of California, Irvine, United States.', '3 UC Irvine Health, United States.']","Rebecca Rowland, Adrien Ponticorvo, Alberto Jarrin Lopez, Shiri Li, Xiaodong Li, Hirohito Ichii, Anthony Durkin, ",Journal of biomedical optics,2019 Nov,"kidney, cold storage preservation; organ transplantation; spatial frequency domain imaging; tissue optics.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31777223
354,On the tenth value distance of the photon field along the maze of high-energy linear accelerator vaults,"There is a wide range in the reported photon tenth value distance (TVD) in the maze of high-energy linear accelerator vaults. In order to gain insight into the appropriate use of the TVD value during door design, we performed measurements of the photon dose in the maze of four vaults. In addition, our study represents the first to describe a scenario where an inner borated polyethylene (BPE) door for neutron shielding is installed in the maze downstream to Point A, the point on the maze centerline that is just visible from the isocenter. The measurements were made along the maze centerline at 1 m above the floor. In all cases, the accelerator operated at a nominal energy of 15 MV. Of the four vaults, three were equipped with an inner BPE door at a distance of 1.0-2.1 m downstream to Point A. The door was made of 10.16 cm (4″) BPE sandwiched between two 0.635 cm (1/4″) steel face plates. The photon dose in the maze without a BPE door decreases exponentially with a characteristic TVD of 6 m beyond a distance of 2.5 m from Point A. The presence of a BPE door in an identical vault not only reduces the photon intensity in the maze by about an order of magnitude, but also softens the energy spectrum with a shortened TVD of 4.7 m, significantly lessening the shielding burden at the outer maze entrance. In contrast to the common use of Point A as the reference point to specify distance, the photon dose in the maze with a BPE door located downstream to Point A can be satisfactorily described as exponential functions of the distance measured from the door, which shows good consistency among the three vaults of different room parameters.","[""1 Department of Radiation Oncology, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.""]","Zhaohui Han, Lee M Chin, ",Journal of applied clinical medical physics,2018 Mar,capture gamma ray; maze; shielding; tenth value distance or TVD.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29374424

356,Photonic force optical coherence elastography for three-dimensional mechanical microscopy,"Optical tweezers are an invaluable tool for non-contact trapping and micro-manipulation, but their ability to facilitate high-throughput volumetric microrheology of biological samples for mechanobiology research is limited by the precise alignment associated with the excitation and detection of individual bead oscillations. In contrast, radiation pressure from a low-numerical aperture optical beam can apply transversely localized force over an extended depth range. Here we present photonic force optical coherence elastography (PF-OCE), leveraging phase-sensitive interferometric detection to track sub-nanometer oscillations of beads, embedded in viscoelastic hydrogels, induced by modulated radiation pressure. Since the displacements caused by ultra-low radiation-pressure force are typically obscured by absorption-mediated thermal effects, mechanical responses of the beads were isolated after independent measurement and decoupling of the photothermal response of the hydrogels. Volumetric imaging of bead mechanical responses in hydrogels with different agarose concentrations by PF-OCE was consistent with bulk mechanical characterization of the hydrogels by shear rheometry.","['1 Meinig School of Biomedical Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, 14853, USA.', '2 Optical and Biomedical Engineering Laboratory, School of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering, The University of Western Australia, Perth, WA, 6009, Australia.', '3 School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, 14853, USA.', '4 Meinig School of Biomedical Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, 14853, USA. sga42@cornell.edu.']","Nichaluk Leartprapun, Rishyashring R Iyer, Gavrielle R Untracht, Jeffrey A Mulligan, Steven G Adie, ",Nature communications,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29802258

Here, graphene quantum dots (GQDs) doped with nitrogen and functionalized with an amino group (amino-N-GQDs) serving as a photosensitizer in PDT had the superior ability to generate ROS as compared to unmodified GQDs. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) species were completely eliminated at an ultralow energy (239.36 nJ pixel-1) through only 12 s two-photon excitation (TPE) in the near-infrared region (800 nm). Furthermore, the amino-N-GQDs had an absorption wavelength of approximately 800 nm, quantum yield of 0.33, strong luminescence, an absolute cross section of approximately 54 356 Göeppert-Mayer units, a lifetime of 1.09 ns, a ratio of the radiative to nonradiative decay rates of approximately 0.49, and high two-photon stability under TPE. These favorable properties enabled the amino-N-GQDs to act as a two-photon contrast probe for tracking and localizing analytes through in-depth two-photon imaging in a three-dimensional biological environment and concurrently easily eliminating MDR species through PDT.","['1 Department of Environmental Science and Engineering , Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology , Nanjing 210044 Jiangsu , China.', '2 Department of Physics and Optoelectronic Engineering , Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology , Nanjing 210044 , Jiangsu , China.', '3 Department of Microbiology & Immunology, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, College of Medicine , National Cheng Kung University , Tainan 701 , Taiwan (R.O.C.).', '4 The School of Chinese Medicine for Post-Baccalaureate , I-Shou University , Kaohsiung 824 , Taiwan (R.O.C).', '5 Division of Plastic Surgery, Department of Surgery , E-Da Hospital , Kaohsiung 824 , Taiwan (R.O.C.).', '6 Department of Biological Science and Technology , I-Shou University , Kaohsiung 824 , Taiwan (R.O.C).']","Wen-Shuo Kuo, Yu-Ting Shao, Keng-Shiang Huang, Ting-Mao Chou, Chih-Hui Yang, ",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2018,amino-functionalized nitrogen-doped grapheme quantum dots; multidrug-resistant species; three-dimensional biological environment; two-photon contrast agent probe; two-photon photodynamic therapy.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29620851
359,Determining the energy spectrum of clinical linear accelerator using an optimized photon beam transmission protocol,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      The complex beam delivery techniques for patient treatment using a clinical linear accelerator (linac) may result in variations in the photon spectra, which can lead to dosimetric differences in patients that cannot be accounted for by current treatment planning systems (TPSs). Therefore, precise knowledge of the fluence and energy spectrum (ES) of the therapeutic beam is very important. However, owing to the high energy and flux of the beam, the ES cannot be measured directly, and validation of the spectrum modeled in the TPS is difficult. The aim of this study is to develop an efficient beam transmission measurement procedure for accurately reconstructing the ES of a therapeutic x-ray beam generated by a clinical linac. Methods:
      
    

    
      The attenuation of a 6 MV photon beam from an Elekta Synergy Platform clinical linac through different thicknesses of graphite and lead was measured using an ion chamber. The response of the ion chamber as a function of photon energy was obtained using the Monte Carlo (MC) method in the Geant4 simulation code. Using the curves obtained in the photon beam transmission measurements and the ion chamber energy response, the ES was reconstructed using an iterative algorithm based on a mathematical model of the spectrum. To evaluate the accuracy of the spectrum reconstruction method, the reconstructed ES (ESrecon ) was compared to that determined by the MC simulation (ESMC ). Results:
      
    

    
      The ion chamber model in the Geant4 simulation was well validated by comparing the ion chamber perturbation factors determined by the TRS-398 calibration protocol and EGSnrc; the differences were within 0.57%. The number of transmission measurements was optimized to 10 for efficient spectrum reconstruction according to the rate of increase in the spectrum reconstruction accuracy. The distribution of ESrecon obtained using the measured transmission curves was clearly similar to the reference, ESMC , and the dose distributions in water calculated using ESrecon and ESMC were similar within a 2% local difference. However, in a heterogeneous medium, the dose discrepancy between them was >5% when a complex beam delivery technique composed of 171 control points was used. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The proposed measurement procedure required a total time of approximately 1 h to obtain and analyze 20 transmission measurements. In addition, it was confirmed that the transmission curve of high-Z materials influences the accuracy of spectrum reconstruction more than that of low-Z materials. A well-designed transmission measurement protocol suitable for clinical environments could be an essential tool for better dosimetric accuracy in patient treatment and for periodic verification of the beam quality.","['1 Department of Radiation Convergence Engineering, Yonsei University, 1 Yeonsedae-gil, Heungeop-myeon, Wonju, 26493, Korea.', '2 Center for Ionizing Radiation, Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science, Daejeon 34113, Korea.']","Hyun Joon Choi, Hyojun Park, Chul Young Yi, Byoung-Chul Kim, Wook-Geun Shin, Chul Hee Min, ",Medical physics,2019 Jul,Geant4; energy spectrum reconstruction; ion chamber; linear accelerator; transmission measurement.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31055830
360,Nanoaperture fabrication via colloidal lithography for single molecule fluorescence analysis,"In single molecule fluorescence studies, background emission from labeled substrates often restricts their concentrations to non-physiological nanomolar values. One approach to address this challenge is the use of zero-mode waveguides (ZMWs), nanoscale holes in a thin metal film that physically and optically confine the observation volume allowing much higher concentrations of fluorescent substrates. Standard fabrication of ZMWs utilizes slow and costly E-beam nano-lithography. Herein, ZMWs are made using a self-assembled mask of polystyrene microspheres, enabling fabrication of thousands of ZMWs in parallel without sophisticated equipment. Polystyrene 1 μm dia. microbeads self-assemble on a glass slide into a hexagonal array, forming a mask for the deposition of metallic posts in the inter-bead interstices. The width of those interstices (and subsequent posts) is adjusted within 100-300 nm by partially fusing the beads at the polystyrene glass transition temperature. The beads are dissolved in toluene, aluminum or gold cladding is deposited around the posts, and those are dissolved, leaving behind an array ZMWs. Parameter optimization and the performance of the ZMWs are presented. By using colloidal self-assembly, typical laboratories can make use of sub-wavelength ZMW technology avoiding the availability and expense of sophisticated clean-room environments and equipment.","['1 Pennsylvania Muscle Institute, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', '2 Department of Physics, West Chester University, West Chester, Pennsylvania, United States of America.']","Ryan M Jamiolkowski, Kevin Y Chen, Shane A Fiorenza, Alyssa M Tate, Shawn H Pfeil, Yale E Goldman, ",PloS one,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31600217

Due to the fractional change in the light signal, it has been difficult to use this method as a quantitative assay. This article describes special optics and slice handling systems, which render this technique stable and reliable. The present article demonstrates the slice handling, staining, and recording of the VSD-stained hippocampal slices in detail. The system maintains physiological conditions for a long time, with good staining, and prevents mechanical movements of the slice during the recordings. Moreover, it enables staining of slices with a small amount of the dye. The optics achieve high numerical aperture at low magnification, which allows recording of the VSD signal at the maximum frame rate of 10 kHz, with 100 pixel x 100-pixel spatial resolution. Due to the high frame rate and spatial resolution, this technique allows application of the post-recording filters that provide sufficient signal-to-noise ratio to assess the changes in neural circuits.","['1 Laboratory for Neural Circuit Systems, Institute of Neuroscience, Tokushima Bunri University.', '2 Laboratory for Neural Circuit Systems, Institute of Neuroscience, Tokushima Bunri University; tominagat@kph.bunri-u.ac.jp.']","Yoko Tominaga, Makiko Taketoshi, Naoko Maeda, Takashi Tominaga, ",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31282882

The obtained results were validated using single-plex RT-qPCR and found to be in good agreement, demonstrating the potential of this technique for lncRNA quantification applications.","['1 Department of Chemistry, University of Michigan, 930 N.

Removable splints were more restrictive than no immobilization. Results suggest there is no benefit in using scaphoid-type casts rather than Colles'-type casts to reduce wrist motion.","['1 Cardiff School of Engineering, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.']","Andrew Waton, Sarah Forrest, Gemma M Whatling, ","The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",2019 Jul,Colles’ cast; Scaphoid fracture; immobilization; optoelectronic; scaphoid cast.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30975050
366,Characterization of Nylon-12 as a water-equivalent solid phantom material for dosimetric measurements in therapeutic photon and electron beams,"The tissue- or water-equivalence of dosimetry phantoms used as substitutes for water is essential for absorbed dose measurements in radiotherapy. At our institution, a heterogeneous pelvic phantom that consists of stacked Nylon-12 layers has recently been manufactured for Gafchromic film dosimetry. However, data on the use of Nylon as tissue-mimicking media for dosimetric applications are scarce. This study characterizes the water-equivalence of Nylon-12 for dosimetric measurements in therapeutic photon and electron beams. Employing an Elekta Synergy and SL25 linear accelerator (Linac), photon beam transmission measurements for 6 MV and 15 MV, acquired in narrow beam geometry with a 0.6 cm3 Farmer-type ion chamber showed that the mass attenuation coefficient μm of Nylon-12 agrees with the values of water, water-equivalent RW3 and Perspex phantom materials within 3%. For 6 MV, the μm values were 0.0477 ± 0.002 cm2/g, 0.0490 ± 0.003 cm2/g, 0.0482 ± 0.001 cm2/g and 0.0479 ± 0.002cm2/g for Nylon-12, water, RW3, and Perspex, respectively. Differences within 2% were attained between depth dose data measured in Nylon-12 slabs with Gafchromic EBT3 films and in water with a Roos ion chamber for 10 × 10 cm2 6, 12 and 20 MeV electron beams produced by the Elekta Synergy and SL25 Linacs. Also, a good agreement within 2% was obtained between percent depth doses computed by DOSXYZnrc Monte Carlo simulations in water, Nylon-12 and RW3 materials for photon spectra between 250 kV and 15 MV. The discrepancies between the ratios of average, restricted stopping powers of Nylon to air and water to air for photon spectra ranging from 2 to 45 MV are typically within 1% signifying that Nylon and water have equivalent stopping power characteristics. This study highlights that Nylon-12 can be used as a tissue-mimicking phantom material for dosimetric measurements in clinical megavoltage photon and electron beams as it exhibits good water-equivalence.","['1 Medical Physics Department, University of the Free State, PO Box 339, Bloemfontein, 9300, South Africa.

368,Programmed coherent coupling in a synthetic DNA-based excitonic circuit,"Natural light-harvesting systems spatially organize densely packed chromophore aggregates using rigid protein scaffolds to achieve highly efficient, directed energy transfer. Here, we report a synthetic strategy using rigid DNA scaffolds to similarly program the spatial organization of densely packed, discrete clusters of cyanine dye aggregates with tunable absorption spectra and strongly coupled exciton dynamics present in natural light-harvesting systems. We first characterize the range of dye-aggregate sizes that can be templated spatially by A-tracts of B-form DNA while retaining coherent energy transfer. We then use structure-based modelling and quantum dynamics to guide the rational design of higher-order synthetic circuits consisting of multiple discrete dye aggregates within a DX-tile. These programmed circuits exhibit excitonic transport properties with prominent circular dichroism, superradiance, and fast delocalized exciton transfer, consistent with our quantum dynamics predictions. This bottom-up strategy offers a versatile approach to the rational design of strongly coupled excitonic circuits using spatially organized dye aggregates for use in coherent nanoscale energy transport, artificial light-harvesting, and nanophotonics.","['1 Department of Biological Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA.', '2 MIT-Harvard Center for Excitonics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA.', '3 Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138, USA.', '4 Center for Innovation in Medicine, The Biodesign Institute, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona 85287, USA.', '5 Department of Chemistry, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA.', '6 School of Molecular Sciences, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona 85287, USA.', '7 Center for Molecular Design and Biomimetics, The Biodesign Institute, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona 85287, USA.']","Étienne Boulais, Nicolas P D Sawaya, Rémi Veneziano, Alessio Andreoni, James L Banal, Toru Kondo, Sarthak Mandal, Su Lin, Gabriela S Schlau-Cohen, Neal W Woodbury, Hao Yan, Alán Aspuru-Guzik, Mark Bathe, ",Nature materials,2018 Feb,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29180771

Despite their long history and widespread application, the scope of these therapeutic approaches has been limited by a lack of specificity and challenges with light delivery. In recent years, much progress has been made in these regards. Photopharmacology has provided drug-like molecules that change their efficacy upon irradiation and allow for the optical control of a wide range of defined biological targets. Many photopharmaceuticals are now used in vivo and some show promising results in preclinical development.

371,Acquisition of temporal order requires an intact CA3 commissural/associational (C/A) feedback system in mice,"Episodic memory, an essential element of orderly thinking, requires the organization of serial events into narratives about the identity of cues along with their locations and temporal order (what, where, and when). The hippocampus plays a central role in the acquisition and retrieval of episodes with two of its subsystems being separately linked to what and where information. The substrates for the third element are poorly understood. Here we report that in hippocampal slices field CA3 maintains self-sustained activity for remarkable periods following a brief input and that this effect is extremely sensitive to minor network perturbations. Using behavioral tests, that do not involve training or explicit rewards, we show that partial silencing of the CA3 commissural/associational network in mice blocks acquisition of temporal order, but not the identity or location, of odors. These results suggest a solution to the question of how hippocampus adds time to episodic memories.","['1 1Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology, University of California, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.', '2 2Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, University of California, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.', '3 3Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior, University of California, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.']","Brittney M Cox, Conor D Cox, Benjamin G Gunn, Aliza A Le, Victoria C Inshishian, Christine M Gall, Gary Lynch, ",Communications biology,2019,Hippocampus; Neural encoding.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31286068

      This study aimed to calculate the photon and neutron doses received to the contralateral breast (CB) during breast cancer radiotherapy for various field sizes in the presence of a physical wedge. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      Varian 2100 C/D linear accelerator was simulated using a MCNP4C Monte Carlo code. Then, a phantom of real female chest was simulated and the treatment planning was carried out on tumoral breast (left breast). Finally, the received photon and neutron doses to CB (right breast) were calculated in the presence of a physical wedge for 18 MV photon beam energy. These calculations were performed for different field sizes including 11 cm × 13 cm, 11 cm × 17 cm, and 11 cm × 21 cm. Results:
      
    

    
      The findings showed that the received doses (both of the photon and neutron) to CB in the presence of a physical wedge for 11 cm × 13 cm, 11 cm × 17 cm, and 11 cm × 21 cm field sizes were 9.87%, 12.91%, and 27.37% of the prescribed dose, respectively. In addition, the results showed that the received photon and neutron doses to CB increased with increment in the field size. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      From the results of this study, it is concluded that the received photon and neutron doses to CB in the presence of a physical wedge is relatively more, and therefore, they should be reduced to as low as possible. Therefore, using a dynamic wedge instead of a physical wedge or field-in-field technique is suggested.","['1 Radiation and Wave Research Center, Aja University of Medical Science, Tehran, Iran.', '2 Department of Medical Physics and Radiology, Faculty of Paramedical Sciences, Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, Iran.', '3 Department of Medical Physics, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', '4 Nuclear Science and Technology Research Institute, Radiation Applications School, Tehran, Iran.', '5 Faculty of Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']","Hamed Bagheri, Bagher Farhood, Seied Rabi Mahdavi, Babak Shekarchi, Farhad Manouchehri, Malahat Esfandbod, ",Journal of cancer research and therapeutics,Jul-Sep 2019,Contralateral breast; Monte Carlo; neutron dose; physical wedge; radiotherapy.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31603104
375,Viral-based nanomaterials for plasmonic and photonic materials and devices,"Over the last decade, viruses have established themselves as a powerful tool in nanotechnology. Their proteinaceous capsids benefit from biocompatibility, chemical addressability, and a variety of sizes and geometries, while their ability to encapsulate, scaffold, and self-assemble enables their use for a wide array of purposes. Moreover, the scaling up of viral-based nanotechnologies is facilitated by high capsid production yield and speed, which is particularly advantageous when compared with slower and costlier lithographic techniques. These features enable the bottom-up fabrication of photonic and plasmonic materials, which relies on the precise arrangement of photoactive material at the nanoscale to control phenomena such as electromagnetic wave propagation and energy transfer. The interdisciplinary approach required for the fabrication of such materials combines techniques from the life sciences and device engineering, thus promoting innovative research. Materials with applications spanning the fields of sensing (biological, chemical, and physical sensors), nanomedicine (cellular imaging, drug delivery, phototherapy), energy transfer and conversion (solar cells, light harvesting, photocatalysis), metamaterials (negative refraction, artificial magnetism, near-field amplification), and nanoparticle synthesis are considered with exclusive emphasis on viral capsids and protein cages.

376,Resolving fluorescent species by their brightness and diffusion using correlated photon-counting histograms,"Fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy (FFS) refers to techniques that analyze fluctuations in the fluorescence emitted by fluorophores diffusing in a small volume and can be used to distinguish between populations of molecules that exhibit differences in brightness or diffusion. For example, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) resolves species through their diffusion by analyzing correlations in the fluorescence over time; photon counting histograms (PCH) and related methods based on moment analysis resolve species through their brightness by analyzing fluctuations in the photon counts. Here we introduce correlated photon counting histograms (cPCH), which uses both types of information to simultaneously resolve fluorescent species by their brightness and diffusion. We define the cPCH distribution by the probability to detect both a particular number of photons at the current time and another number at a later time. FCS and moment analysis are special cases of the moments of the cPCH distribution, and PCH is obtained by summing over the photon counts in either channel. cPCH is inherently a dual channel technique, and the expressions we develop apply to the dual colour case. Using simulations, we demonstrate that two species differing in both their diffusion and brightness can be better resolved with cPCH than with either FCS or PCH. Further, we show that cPCH can be extended both to longer dwell times to improve the signal-to-noise and to the analysis of images. By better exploiting the information available in fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy, cPCH will be an enabling methodology for quantitative biology.","['1 Department of Physiology, McGill University, 3655 Promenade Sir William Osler, Montreal, Quebec H3G 1Y6, Canada.', '2 School of Biological Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Mayfield Road, Edinburgh EH9 3BF, United Kingdom.']","Nathan Scales, Peter S Swain, ",PloS one,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31887113

Existing solutions for optical coherence microscopy (OCM) suffer from either large data size and long acquisition time or a nonideal point spread function. We present volumetric OCM of mouse brain ex vivo with a large depth coverage by leveraging computational adaptive optics (CAO) to significantly reduce the number of OCM volumes that need to be acquired with a Gaussian beam focused at different depths. We demonstrate volumetric reconstruction of ex-vivo mouse brain with lateral resolution of 2.2 μm, axial resolution of 4.7 μm, and depth range of ∼1.2 mm optical path length, using only 11 OCT data volumes acquired on a spectral-domain OCM system. Compared to focus scanning with step size equal to the Rayleigh length of the beam, this is a factor of 4 fewer datasets required for volumetric imaging. Coregistered two-photon microscopy confirmed that CAO-OCM reconstructions can visualize various tissue microstructures in the brain. Our results also highlight the limitations of CAO in highly scattering media, particularly when attempting to reconstruct far from the focal plane or when imaging deep within the sample.","['1 Cornell University, Meinig School of Biomedical Engineering, Ithaca, New York, United States.']","Meiqi Wu, David M Small, Nozomi Nishimura, Steven G Adie, ",Journal of biomedical optics,2019 Nov,computational adaptive optics; mouse brain; optical coherence microscopy.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31773937
378,Output correction factors for small static fields in megavoltage photon beams for seven ionization chambers in two orientations - perpendicular and parallel,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      The goal of the present work was to provide a large set of detector-specific output correction factors for seven small volume ionization chambers on two linear accelerators in four megavoltage photon beams utilizing perpendicular and parallel orientation of ionization chambers in the beam for nominal field sizes ranging from 0.5 cm2 × 0.5 cm2 to 10 cm2  × 10 cm2 . The present study is the second part of an extensive research conducted by our group. Methods:
      
    

    
      Output correction factors k Q clin , Q ref  f clin , f ref    were experimentally determined on two linacs, Elekta Versa HD and Varian TrueBeam for 6 and 10 MV beams with and without flattening filter for nine square fields ranging from 0.5 cm2  × 0.5 cm2 to 10 cm2  × 10 cm2 , for seven mini and micro ionization chambers, IBA CC04, IBA Razor, PTW 31016 3D PinPoint, PTW 31021 3D Semiflex, PTW 31022 3D PinPoint, PTW 31023 PinPoint, and SI Exradin A16. An Exradin W1 plastic scintillator and EBT3 radiochromic films were used as the reference detectors. Results:
      
    

    
      For all ionization chambers, values of output correction factors k Q clin , Q ref  f clin , f ref    were lower for parallel orientation compared to those obtained in the perpendicular orientation. Five ionization chambers from our study set, IBA Razor, PTW 31016 3D PinPoint, PTW 31022 3D PinPoint, PTW 31023 PinPoint, and SI Exradin A16, fulfill the requirement recommended in the TRS-483 Code of Practice, that is, 0.95 < k Q clin , Q ref  f clin , f ref   < 1.05  , down to the field size 0.8 cm2  × 0.8 cm2 , when they are positioned in parallel orientation; two of the ionization chambers, IBA Razor and PTW 31023 PinPoint, satisfy this condition down to the field size of 0.5 cm2 × 0.5 cm2 . Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The present paper provides experimental results of detector-specific output correction factors for seven small volume ionization chambers. Output correction factors were determined in 6 and 10 MV photon beams with and without flattening filter down to the square field size of 0.5 cm2 × 0.5 cm2 for two orientations of ionization chambers - perpendicular and parallel. Our main finding is that output correction factors are smaller if they are determined in a parallel orientation compared to those obtained in a perpendicular orientation for all ionization chambers regardless of the photon beam energy, filtration, or linear accelerator being used. Based on our findings, we recommend using ionization chambers in parallel orientation, to minimize corrections in the experimental determination of field output factors. Latter holds even for field sizes below 1.0 cm2 × 1.0 cm2 , whenever necessary corrections remain within 5%, which was the case for several ionization chambers from our set. TRS-483 recommended perpendicular orientation of ionization chambers for the determination of field output factors. The present study presents results for both perpendicular and parallel orientation of ionization chambers. When validated by other researchers, the present results for parallel orientation can be considered as a complementary dataset to those given in TRS-483.","['1 Department for Dosimetry and Quality of Radiological Procedures, Institute of Oncology Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia.', '2 Medical Physics Service, North Estonia Medical Centre, Tallinn, Estonia.', '3 Medical Physics Department, University Hospital Rijeka, Rijeka, Croatia.', '4 Department of Physics and Biophysics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Rijeka, Rijeka, Croatia.', '5 Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.']","Božidar Casar, Eduard Gershkevitsh, Ignasi Mendez, Slaven Jurković, M Saiful Huq, ",Medical physics,2020 Jan,ionization chamber; orientation; output correction factor; small field.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31677278

380,Enhancement of linear energy transfer in gold nanoparticles mediated radiation therapy,"Objective:
      
    

    
      The metric dose enhancement ratio (DER) has been widely used to assess the enhancing capability of gold nanoparticles (GNPs). However, there is a large disparity between the observed radiobiological outcome and DER values. A new metric, linear energy transfer enhancement ratio (LETER), is introduced to bridge the gap between theoretical predictions and the experimentally measured sensitization. Methods:
      
    

    
      The radiation transport code SCEPTRE is used to examine the efficacy of the proposed new metric. Different clusters of GNPs irradiated with x-ray photons generated at 120 kVp and therapeutic 6 MV photon beams are investigated. For each pattern, two GNPs sizes are examined 50 and 100 nm. Results:
      
    

    
      An enhancement in the linear energy transfer has been observed for both energies. In the case of 120 kVp, LETER is substantially lower than DER; moreover, it decreases with increasing GNP size. On the other hand, the results of 6 MV show that LETER is relatively higher than DER, and it increases with the size of GNP. For the studied energies, LETER is in good agreement with the sensitization reported in the literature. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The results indicate the merit of LETER as a better indicator of the radiobiological outcome of GNP aided radiotherapy.","['1 Department of Physics and Applied Physics, University of Massachusetts Lowell, Lowell, MA 01854, USA.

381,2D monolithic silicon-diode array detectors in megavoltage photon beams: does the fabrication technology matter? A medical physicist's perspective,"A family of prototype 2D monolithic silicon-diode array detectors (MP512, Duo, Octa) has been proposed by the Centre for Medical Radiation Physics, University of Wollongong (Australia) for relative dosimetry in small megavoltage photon beams. These detectors, which differ in the topology of their 512 sensitive volumes, were originally fabricated on bulk p-type substrates. More recently, they have also been fabricated on epitaxial p-type substrates. In the literature, their performance has been individually characterized for quality assurance (QA) applications. The present study directly assessed and compared that of a MP512-bulk and that of a MP512-epitaxial in terms of radiation hardness, long-term stability, response linearity with dose, dose per pulse and angular dependence. Their measurements of output factors, off-axis ratios and percentage depth doses in square radiation fields collimated by the jaws and produced by 6 MV and 10 MV flattened photon beams were then benchmarked against those by commercially available detectors. The present investigation was aimed at establishing, from a medical physicist's perspective, how the bulk and epitaxial fabrication technologies would affect the implementation of the MP512s into a QA protocol. Based on results, the MP512-epitaxial would offer superior radiation hardness, long-term stability and achievable uniformity and reproducibility of the response across the 2D active area.","['1 Centre for Medical Radiation Physics (CMRP), University of Wollongong, Wollongong, Australia.', '2 Department of Radiology, Faculty of Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', '3 Department of Medical Services, Lopburi Cancer Hospital, Lopburi, Thailand.', '4 Illawarra Health and Medical Research Institute (IHMRI), Wollongong, Australia.', '5 Illawarra Cancer Care Centre (ICCC), Wollongong, Australia.', '6 SPA-BIT, Kiev, Ukraine.', '7 Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia.', '8 Sir Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia.', '9 Centre for Medical Radiation Physics (CMRP), University of Wollongong, Wollongong, Australia. anatoly@uow.edu.au.', '10 Illawarra Health and Medical Research Institute (IHMRI), Wollongong, Australia. anatoly@uow.edu.au.']","N Stansook, G Biasi, K Utitsarn, M Petasecca, P Metcalfe, M Carolan, M L F Lerch, V L Perevertaylo, T Kron, A B Rosenfeld, ",Australasian physical & engineering sciences in medicine,2019 Jun,2D monolithic silicon-diode array detector; Dosimetry; Epitaxial silicon; Megavoltage photon beam.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30790139
382,"Direct measurement of ion chamber correction factors, k Q and k B, in a 7 MV MRI-linac","The output of MRI-integrated photon therapy (MRgXT) devices is measured in terms of absorbed dose to water, D w. Traditionally this is done with reference type ion chambers calibrated in a beam quality Q 0 without magnetic field. To correct the ion chamber response for the application in the magnetic field, a factor needs to be applied that corrects for both beam quality Q and the presence of the magnetic field B, k Q,B. This can be expressed as the product of k Q, without magnetic field, and ion chamber magnetic field correction, k B. k B depends on the magnetic field strength and its direction, the direction of the beam and the orientation and type of the ion chamber. In this study, for the first time, both k Q and k B were measured directly for six waterproof ion chambers (3 × PTW 30013 and 3 × IBA FC65-G) in a pre-clinical 7 MV MRI-linac at 0 T and at 1.5 T. Measurements were done with the only available primary standard built for this purpose, a water calorimeter. Resulting k Q factors for PTW and IBA chambers were 0.985(5) and 0.990(4), respectively. k B factors were measured with the chambers in antiparallel direction to the magnetic field (|| 180°), and perpendicular direction (⊥ -90°). k B|| and k B⊥ for the PTW chambers were 0.985(6) and 0.963(4), respectively and for IBA chambers 0.995(4) and 0.956(4). Agreement with the available literature values was shown, partly caused by the relatively large standard deviation (SD) in those values. The values in this study are currently the only available measured values for k Q and k B in an MRI-linac that are directly linked to the international traceability framework for the quantity absorbed dose to water, D w.","['1 VSL-Dutch Metrology Institute, Delft, The Netherlands.

383,Biophysical characterization of a recombinant lipase KV1 from Acinetobacter haemolyticus in relation to pH and temperature,"Spectroscopic and calorimetric methods were employed to assess the stability and the folding aspect of a novel recombinant alkaline-stable lipase KV1 from Acinetobacter haemolyticus under varying pH and temperature. Data on far ultraviolet-circular dichroism of recombinant lipase KV1 under two alkaline conditions (pH 8.0 and 12.0) at 40 °C reveal strong negative ellipticities at 208, 217, 222 nm, implying its secondary structure belonging to a α + β class with 47.3 and 39.0% ellipticity, respectively. Results demonstrate that lipase KV1 adopts its most stable conformation at pH 8.0 and 40 °C. Conversely, the protein assumes a random coil structure at pH 4.0 and 80 °C, evident from a strong negative peak at ∼ 200 nm. This blue shift suggests a general decline in enzyme activity in conjunction with the partially or fully unfolded state that invariably exposed more hydrophobic surfaces of the lipase protein. The maximum emission at ∼335 nm for pH 8.0 and 40 °C indicates the adoption of a favorable protein conformation with a high number of buried tryptophan residues, reducing solvent exposure. Appearance of an intense Amide I absorption band at pH 8.0 corroborates an intact secondary structure. A lower enthalpy value for pH 4.0 over pH 8.0 and 12.0 in the differential scanning calorimetric data corroborates the stability of the lipase at alkaline conditions, while a low Km (0.68 ± 0.03 mM) for tributyrin verifies the high affinity of lipase KV1 for the substrate. The data, herein offer useful insights into future structure-based tunable catalytic activity of lipase KV1.","['1 Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, 81310 UTM, Johor, Malaysia; Enzyme Technology and Green Synthesis Group, Faculty of Science, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, 81310 UTM, Johor Bahru, Malaysia.', '2 Department of Biotechnology and Medical Engineering, Faculty of Bioscience and Medical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, 81310 UTM, Johor, Malaysia; Enzyme Technology and Green Synthesis Group, Faculty of Science, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, 81310 UTM, Johor Bahru, Malaysia.', '3 Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, 81310 UTM, Johor, Malaysia; Enzyme Technology and Green Synthesis Group, Faculty of Science, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, 81310 UTM, Johor Bahru, Malaysia.

In particular, the design of soft devices in optics has attracted tremendous interests attributed to their distinct advantages such as inherent electrical safety, high stability in long-term operation, potential to be miniaturized, and free of electromagnetic interferences. As the alternatives to conventional rigid optical waveguides, considerable efforts have been made to develop light-guiding devices by using various transparent and elastic polymers, which offer desired physiomechanical properties and enable wearable/implantable applications in optical sensing, diagnostics, and therapy. Here, we review recent progress in soft and stretchable optical waveguides and sensors, including advanced structural design, fabrication strategies, and functionalities. Furthermore, the potential applications of those optical devices for various wearable and biomedical applications are discussed. It is expected that the newly emerged soft and stretchable optical technologies will provide a safe and reliable alternative to next-generation, smart wearables and healthcare devices.","['1 State Key Laboratory of Precision Measurement Technology and Instruments, Department of Precision Instruments, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China. guojj018@tsinghua.edu.cn.', '2 State Key Laboratory of Precision Measurement Technology and Instruments, Department of Precision Instruments, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China.', '3 Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China.', '4 State Key Laboratory of Precision Measurement Technology and Instruments, Department of Precision Instruments, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China. konglj@tsinghua.edu.cn.']","Jingjing Guo, Changxi Yang, Qionghai Dai, Lingjie Kong, ","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019,optical sensing and sensors; polymer optical waveguides; wearable and implantable devices.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31480393

Polydopamine (PDA), an artificial black polymer produced by self-oxidative polymerization of dopamine, has attracted extensive attention because of its unique properties. PDA is a melanin-like material, and recent studies have reported that photonic materials based on PDA particles showed structural colors by enhancing color saturation through the absorption of scattered light. Herein, we describe the preparation of three-dimensional (3D) colloidal photonic materials, such as structural color balls and fibers, from biomimetic core-shell particles with melanin-like PDA shell layers. Structural color balls were prepared through the combined use of membrane emulsion and heating. We also demonstrated the use of microfluidic emulsification and solvent diffusion for the fabrication of structural color fibers. The obtained 3D colloidal materials, i.e., balls and fibers, exhibited angle-independent structural colors due to the amorphous assembly of PDA-containing particles. These findings provide new insight for the development of dye-free technology for the coloration of various 3D colloidal architectures.","['1 Division of Applied Chemistry and Biotechnology, Graduate School of Engineering , Chiba University , 1-33 Yayoi-cho , Inage-ku, Chiba 263-8522 , Japan.', '2 Department of Applied Chemistry and Biotechnology, Graduate School of Natural Science and Technology , Okayama University , 3-1-1 Tsushima-naka , Kita-ku, Okayama 700-8530 , Japan.']","Michinari Kohri, Kenshi Yanagimoto, Ayaka Kawamura, Kosuke Hamada, Yoshihiko Imai, Takaichi Watanabe, Tsutomu Ono, Tatsuo Taniguchi, Keiki Kishikawa, ",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2018,membrane emulsification; microfluidics; photonic materials; polydopamine; structural color.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28661653

Corresponding natural polymers are promising building blocks for constructing synthetic multifunctional photonic structures owing to their renewability, biocompatibility, mechanical robustness, ambient processing conditions, and diverse surface chemistry. In this review, we provide a summary of the light phenomena in biophotonic structures found in nature, the selection of corresponding biopolymers for synthetic photonic structures, the fabrication strategies for flexible photonics, and corresponding emerging photonic-related applications.

388,Metasurface optics for full-color computational imaging,"Conventional imaging systems comprise large and expensive optical components that successively mitigate aberrations. Metasurface optics offers a route to miniaturize imaging systems by replacing bulky components with flat and compact implementations. The diffractive nature of these devices, however, induces severe chromatic aberrations, and current multiwavelength and narrowband achromatic metasurfaces cannot support full visible spectrum imaging (400 to 700 nm). We combine principles of both computational imaging and metasurface optics to build a system with a single metalens of numerical aperture ~0.45, which generates in-focus images under white light illumination. Our metalens exhibits a spectrally invariant point spread function that enables computational reconstruction of captured images with a single digital filter. This work connects computational imaging and metasurface optics and demonstrates the capabilities of combining these disciplines by simultaneously reducing aberrations and downsizing imaging systems using simpler optics.","['1 Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA.', '2 Department of Physics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA.']","Shane Colburn, Alan Zhan, Arka Majumdar, ",Science advances,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29487913

      To compare time-dependent changes in lung parenchyma of early-stage non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patients after stereotactic body radiation therapy with protons (SBPT) or photons (SBRT). Materials and method:
      
    

    
      We retrospectively identified NSCLC patients treated with SBPT and matched each one with a SBRT patient by patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics. Lung parenchyma on serial post-treatment chest computer tomography (CT) scans was deformably registered with the treatment plan to analyze lung density changes as function of dose, quantified by Houndsfield Unit (HU)/Gy. A thoracic radiologist also evaluated the CTs using an established grading system. Results:
      
    

    
      We matched 23 SBPT/SBRT pairs, including 5 patients treated with both modalities (internally matched cohort). Normal lung response following SBPT significantly increased in the early time period (CTs acquired <6 months, median 3 months) post-treatment, and then did not change significantly in the later time period (CTs acquired 6-14 months, median 9 months). For SBRT, the normal lung response was similar to SBPT in the early time period, but then increased significantly from the early to the late time period (p = 0.007). These differences were most pronounced in sensitive (response >6 HU/Gy) patients and in the internally matched cohort. However, there was no significant difference in the maximum observed response in the entire cohort over all time periods, median 3.4 [IQR, 1.0-5.4] HU/Gy (SBPT) versus 2.5 [1.6-5.2] HU/Gy (SBRT). Qualitative radiological evaluation was highly correlated with the quantitative analysis (p < 0.0001). Conclusion:
      
    

    
      While there was no significant difference in maximum response after SBPT versus SBRT, dose-defined lung inflammation occurred earlier after proton irradiation. Further investigation is warranted into the mechanisms of inflammation and therapeutic consequences after proton versus photon irradiation.","['1 Department of Radiation Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, USA.', '2 Department of Radiation Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, USA; Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA.', '3 Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, USA.', '4 Department of Radiation Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, USA.

391,Complex vectorial optics through gradient index lens cascades,"Graded index (GRIN) lenses are commonly used for compact imaging systems. It is not widely appreciated that the ion-exchange process that creates the rotationally symmetric GRIN lens index profile also causes a symmetric birefringence variation. This property is usually considered a nuisance, such that manufacturing processes are optimized to keep it to a minimum. Here, rather than avoiding this birefringence, we understand and harness it by using GRIN lenses in cascade with other optical components to enable extra functionality in commonplace GRIN lens systems. We show how birefringence in the GRIN cascades can generate vector vortex beams and foci, and how it can be used advantageously to improve axial resolution. Through using the birefringence for analysis, we show that the GRIN cascades form the basis of a new single-shot Müller matrix polarimeter with potential for endoscopic label-free cancer diagnostics. The versatility of these cascades opens up new technological directions.","['1 Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3PJ, UK. chao.he@eng.ox.ac.uk.', '2 Department of Physics, Tsinghua University, 100084, Beijing, China.', '3 Shenzhen Key Laboratory for Minimal Invasive Medical Technologies, Institute of Optical Imaging and Sensing, Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University, 518055, Shenzhen, China.', '4 Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3PJ, UK.', ""5 Shenzhen Sixth People's Hospital (Nanshan Hospital) Huazhong University of Science and Technology Union Shenzhen Hospital, 518052, Shenzhen, China."", '6 Hamlyn Centre for Robotic Surgery, Institute of Global Health Innovation, Imperial College London, London, SW7 2AZ, UK.', '7 School of Data Science, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China.', '8 Department of Biomedical Engineering, College of Engineering, Peking University, 100871, Beijing, China.', '9 Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3PJ, UK. martin.booth@eng.ox.ac.uk.']","Chao He, Jintao Chang, Qi Hu, Jingyu Wang, Jacopo Antonello, Honghui He, Shaoxiong Liu, Jianyu Lin, Ben Dai, Daniel S Elson, Peng Xi, Hui Ma, Martin J Booth, ",Nature communications,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31537802

      The aim of this study is to evaluate soft-tissue composition effect on dose distribution for various soft tissues in radiotherapy with a 6 MV photon beam of a medical linac. Background:
      
    

    
      The compositions of various soft tissues are different which could affect dose calculations. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      A phantom and Siemens Primus linear accelerator were simulated using MCNPX Monte Carlo code. In a homogeneous cubic phantom, six types of soft tissue and three types of tissue-equivalent materials were defined separately. The soft tissues were muscle (skeletal), adipose tissue, blood (whole), breast tissue, soft tissue (9-component), and soft tissue (4-component). The tissue-equivalent materials included water, A-150 tissue equivalent plastic and perspex. Photon dose relative to dose in 9-component soft tissue at various depths on the beam's central axis was determined for the 6 MV photon beam. The relative dose was also calculated and compared for various MCNPX tallies including *F8, F6, and *F4. Results:
      
    

    
      The results of the relative photon dose in various materials relative to dose in 9-component soft tissue using different tallies are reported in the form of tabulated data. Minor differences between dose distributions in various soft tissues and tissue-equivalent materials were observed. The results from F6 and F4 were practically the same but differ with the *F8 tally. Conclusions:

However, existing artificial bio-chemical sensors cannot provide tunable modality sensing. Inspired by the anatomical units (folded sensory epithelium) and the functions of a rhinophore, this work introduces a stretchable electrochemical sensor that offers a programmable electro-catalytic performance towards glucose based on the fold/unfold regulation of the gold nanomembrane on an elastic fiber. Geometrical design rationale and covalent bonding strategy are used to realize the robust mechanical and electrical stability of this stretchable bionic sensor. Electrochemical tests demonstrated that the sensitivities of the as-prepared bionic sensor exhibit a linear relationship with its strain states from 0% to 150%. Bio-inspired sensory functions are tested by regulating the strain of the bionic sensor. The sensor achieves a sensitivity of 195.4 μA mM-1 in a low glucose concentration range of 8-206 μM at 150% strain for potentially far-field chemical detection, and a sensitivity of 14.2 μA mM-1 in a high concentration range of 10-100 mM at 0% strain for near-field chemical detection. Moreover, the bionic sensor performs the detection while extending its length can largely enhance the response signal, which is used to distinguish the molecules' source direction. This proposed bionic sensor can be useful in wearable devices, robotics and bionics applications which require diverse modality sensing and smart chemical tracking system.","['1 i-Lab, and Key Laboratory of Multifunctional Nanomaterials and Smart Systems, Suzhou Institute of Nano-Tech and Nano-Bionics (SINANO), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), 398 Ruoshui Road, Suzhou, Jiangsu, 215123, PR China.', ""2 Xi'an Jiaotong Liverpool University, Department of Environmental Science, 111 Renai Road, Suzhou, Jiangsu, 215123, PR China."", '3 i-Lab, and Key Laboratory of Multifunctional Nanomaterials and Smart Systems, Suzhou Institute of Nano-Tech and Nano-Bionics (SINANO), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), 398 Ruoshui Road, Suzhou, Jiangsu, 215123, PR China.

The low depth of focus of high-aperture optics (tens of nm) makes it possible to use z-tomography to reconstruct the structure of samples in soft X-ray microscopy.

397,"Connecting the Dots between Mechanosensitive Channel Abundance, Osmotic Shock, and Survival at Single-Cell Resolution","Rapid changes in extracellular osmolarity are one of many insults microbial cells face on a daily basis. To protect against such shocks, Escherichia coli and other microbes express several types of transmembrane channels that open and close in response to changes in membrane tension. In E. coli, one of the most abundant channels is the mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL). While this channel has been heavily characterized through structural methods, electrophysiology, and theoretical modeling, our understanding of its physiological role in preventing cell death by alleviating high membrane tension remains tenuous. In this work, we examine the contribution of MscL alone to cell survival after osmotic shock at single-cell resolution using quantitative fluorescence microscopy. We conducted these experiments in an E. coli strain which is lacking all mechanosensitive channel genes save for MscL, whose expression was tuned across 3 orders of magnitude through modifications of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence. While theoretical models suggest that only a few MscL channels would be needed to alleviate even large changes in osmotic pressure, we find that between 500 and 700 channels per cell are needed to convey upwards of 80% survival. This number agrees with the average MscL copy number measured in wild-type E. coli cells through proteomic studies and quantitative Western blotting. Furthermore, we observed zero survival events in cells with fewer than ∼100 channels per cell. This work opens new questions concerning the contribution of other mechanosensitive channels to survival, as well as regulation of their activity.IMPORTANCE Mechanosensitive (MS) channels are transmembrane protein complexes which open and close in response to changes in membrane tension as a result of osmotic shock. Despite extensive biophysical characterization, the contribution of these channels to cell survival remains largely unknown. In this work, we used quantitative video microscopy to measure the abundance of a single species of MS channel in single cells, followed by their survival after a large osmotic shock. We observed total death of the population with fewer than ∼100 channels per cell and determined that approximately 500 to 700 channels were needed for 80% survival. The number of channels we found to confer nearly full survival is consistent with the counts of the numbers of channels in wild-type cells in several earlier studies. These results prompt further studies to dissect the contribution of other channel species to survival.","['1 Department of Biology and Biological Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California, USA.', '2 Department of Applied Physics, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California, USA.', '3 Institute of Medical Sciences, University of Aberdeen, Foresterhill, Aberdeen, United Kingdom.', '4 Department of Biology and Biological Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California, USA phillips@pboc.caltech.edu.', '5 Department of Physics, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California, USA.']","Griffin Chure, Heun Jin Lee, Akiko Rasmussen, Rob Phillips, ",Journal of bacteriology,2018,biophysics; mechanosensation; osmoregulation; quantitative methods; single cell.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30201782

      Quantal exocytosis of oxidizable neurotransmitters can be detected as spikes of amperometric current using electrochemical microelectrodes. Measurements of spike parameters indicate the maximal transmitter flux, flux duration, and amount of transmitter released from individual vesicles. Automated analysis algorithms need to reject spikes that overlap in time. In addition, many spikes are preceded by small amplitude ""foot"" signals, attributed to slow release of transmitter through a fusion pore. Accurate pre-spike baseline determination is essential for estimating fusion-pore duration and the amount of transmitter released through the fusion pore. New method:
      
    

    
      We developed an estimation approach that is based on fitting a multi-exponential function to the data. Our previously described matched-filter algorithm is used to identify the sections of data to fit and provides seed values to facilitate convergence of the iterative fit. The new estimation algorithm includes overlap rejection, a two-step fitting procedure and a novel baseline estimation procedure. Results:
      
    

    
      Histograms of spike parameters demonstrate excellent agreement of the new approach with manually computed parameters. Comparison with existing methods:

The improved performance is due to better detection of valid spikes and rejection of overlapping spikes. Moreover, since the complete time course of the spike is fit to a function, more complete information about the spike time course is captured. Conclusions:

400,Detection of Macromolecular Content in a Mixed Solution of Protein Macromolecules and Small Molecules Using a Weak Measurement Linear Differential System,"In this paper, we propose a linear differential detection system based on a frequency domain weak measurement. The system can be used for detecting optical substances. Moreover, we completed an experiment to detect himan serum albumin (HSA) content in a mixture of human serum albumin and l-proline via dialysis. This work also proves the differential function of the system. This experiment can be further extended to detecting protein content in a mixed solution that contains protein macromolecules and various small molecules. It is very important for detecting molecules without photomarking in solutions of complex biological samples. In this paper, the system has an optical resolution of 1.39 × 10-5, and resolution of 4.06 × 10-8 mol/L for himan serum protein solution.","[""1 Institute of Optical Imaging and Sensing, Shenzhen Key Laboratory for Minimal Invasive Medical Technologies, Graduate School at Shenzhen , Tsinghua University , Shenzhen 518055 , People's Republic of China."", ""2 Department of Physics , Tsinghua University , Beijing 100084 , People's Republic of China."", '3 School of Basic Medicine , Guangdong Medical University , Dongguan 523808 , China.', ""4 School of Medicine , Tsinghua University , Beijing 100084 , People's Republic of China."", '5 Center for Optics & Optoelectronics Research, Collaborative Innovation Center for Information Technology in Biological and Medical Physics, College of Science , Zhejiang University of Technology , Hangzhou 310023 , China.', '6 School of Medicine , Glasgow University , Dumbarton Rd, Glasgow G12 8QQ , England.']","Yang Xu, Lixuan Shi, Shaoxin Li, Tian Guan, Suyi Zhong, Xuesi Zhou, Dongmei Li, Cuixia Guo, Yuxuan Yang, Xiangnan Wang, Zhangyan Li, Yonghong He, Luyuan Xie, Zonghan Gan, ",Analytical chemistry,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31407571
401,Performance of electrophysiology procedures at an academic medical center amidst the 2020 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic,"A global coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic occurred at the start of 2020 and is already responsible for more than 74 000 deaths worldwide, just over 100 years after the influenza pandemic of 1918. At the center of the crisis is the highly infectious and deadly SARS-CoV-2, which has altered everything from individual daily lives to the global economy and our collective consciousness. Aside from the pulmonary manifestations of disease, there are likely to be several electrophysiologic (EP) sequelae of COVID-19 infection and its treatment, due to consequences of myocarditis and the use of QT-prolonging drugs. Most crucially, the surge in COVID-19 positive patients that have already overwhelmed the New York City hospital system requires conservation of hospital resources including personal protective equipment (PPE), reassignment of personnel, and reorganization of institutions, including the EP laboratory. In this proposal, we detail the specific protocol changes that our EP department has adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic, including performance of only urgent/emergent procedures, after hours/7-day per week laboratory operation, single attending-only cases to preserve PPE, appropriate use of PPE, telemedicine and video chat follow-up appointments, and daily conferences to collectively manage the clinical and ethical dilemmas to come. We discuss also discuss how we perform EP procedures on presumed COVID positive and COVID tested positive patients to highlight issues that others in the EP community may soon face in their own institution as the virus continues to spread nationally and internationally.","['1 Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York.']","Geoffrey A Rubin, Angelo Biviano, Jose Dizon, Hirad Yarmohammadi, Frederick Ehlert, Deepak Saluja, David A Rubin, John P Morrow, Marc Waase, Jeremy Berman, Alexander Kushnir, Mark P Abrams, Hasan Garan, Elaine Y Wan, ",Journal of cardiovascular electrophysiology,2020 Jun,COVID-19; coronavirus; electrophysiology laboratory; pandemic.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32281214
402,Biological polymeric shielding design for an X-ray laboratory using Monte Carlo codes,"Photon irradiation facilities are often shielded using lead despite its toxicity and high cost. In this study, three Monte Carlo codes, EGS5, MCNPX, and Geant4, were utilized to investigate the efficiency of a relatively new polymeric base compound (CnH2n), as a radiation shielding material for photons with energies below 150 keV. The proposed compound with the densities of 6 and 8 g cm-3 were doped with the weight percentages of 8.0 and 15.0% gadolinium. The probabilities of photoelectric effect and Compton scattering were relatively equal at low photon energies, thus the shielding design was optimized using three Monte Carlo codes for the conformity of calculation results. Consequently, 8% Gd-doped polymer with thickness less than 2 cm and density of 6 g cm-3 was adequate for X-ray room shielding to attenuate more than 95% of the 150-keV incident photons. An average dose rate reduction of 88% can be achieved to ensure safety of the radiation area.","['1 Faculty of Health Sciences, Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin, Kuala Terengganu, Terengganu, Malaysia. suffian@unisza.edu.my.', '2 Nuclear Science and Technology Research Institute, Tehran, Iran.']","Suffian M Tajudin, F Tabbakh, ",Radiological physics and technology,2019 Sep,Gadolinium; Monte Carlo codes; Polymeric compounds.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31302871
403,Design and characterization of a dead-time regime enhanced early photon projection imaging system,"Scattering of visible and near-infrared light in biological tissue reduces spatial resolution for imaging of tissues thicker than 100 μm. In this study, an optical projection imaging system is presented and characterized that exploits the dead-time characteristics typical of photon counting modules based on single photon avalanche diodes (SPADs). With this system, it is possible to attenuate the detection of more scattered late-arriving photons, such that detection of less scattered early-arriving photons can be enhanced with increased light intensity, without being impeded by the maximum count rate of the SPADs. The system has the potential to provide transmittance-based anatomical information or fluorescence-based functional information (with slight modification in the instrumentation) of biological samples with improved resolution in the mesoscopic domain (0.1-2 cm). The system design, calibration, stability, and performance were evaluated using simulation and experimental phantom studies. The proposed system allows for the detection of very-rare early-photons at a higher frequency and with a better signal-to-noise ratio. The experimental results demonstrated over a 3.4-fold improvement in the spatial resolution using early photon detection vs. conventional detection, and a 1000-fold improvement in imaging time using enhanced early detection vs. conventional early photon detection in a 4-mm thick phantom with a tissue-equivalent absorption coefficient of μa = 0.05 mm-1 and a reduced scattering coefficient of μs' = 5 mm-1.","['1 Biomedical Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, Illinois 60616, USA.', '2 Electrical and Computer Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, Illinois 60616, USA.', '3 MPD Micro-Photon-Devices, Via Stradivari 4, 39100 Bolzano, Italy.']","L Sinha, M Fogarty, W Zhou, A Giudice, J G Brankov, K M Tichauer, ",The Review of scientific instruments,2018 Apr,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29716355
404,Parsing human and biophysical drivers of coral reef regimes,"Coral reefs worldwide face unprecedented cumulative anthropogenic effects of interacting local human pressures, global climate change and distal social processes. Reefs are also bound by the natural biophysical environment within which they exist. In this context, a key challenge for effective management is understanding how anthropogenic and biophysical conditions interact to drive distinct coral reef configurations. Here, we use machine learning to conduct explanatory predictions on reef ecosystems defined by both fish and benthic communities. Drawing on the most spatially extensive dataset available across the Hawaiian archipelago-20 anthropogenic and biophysical predictors over 620 survey sites-we model the occurrence of four distinct reef regimes and provide a novel approach to quantify the relative influence of human and environmental variables in shaping reef ecosystems. Our findings highlight the nuances of what underpins different coral reef regimes, the overwhelming importance of biophysical predictors and how a reef's natural setting may either expand or narrow the opportunity space for management interventions. The methods developed through this study can help inform reef practitioners and hold promises for replication across a broad range of ecosystems.","['1 1 Stockholm Resilience Centre, Stockholm University , Stockholm , Sweden.', '2 2 Global Economic Dynamics and the Biosphere Academy Programme, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences , Stockholm , Sweden.', '3 3 Stanford Center for Ocean Solutions, Stanford University , Stanford, CA 94305 , USA.', ""4 4 Hawai'i Institute of Marine Biology, University of Hawai'i at Mānoa , Kaneohe, HI 96744 , USA."", '5 5 School of Ocean Sciences, Bangor University , Anglesey LL59 5AB , UK.', '6 6 Hopkins Marine Station, Stanford University , Pacific Grove, CA 9395 , USA.', '7 7 Pristine Seas, National Geographic Society , Washington, DC 20036 , USA.', '8 8 Lancaster Environment Centre, Lancaster University , Lancaster LA1 4YQ , UK.', '9 9 Ecosystem Science Division, Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center, National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration , Honolulu, HI, 96818 , USA.', '10 10 National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis, University of California Santa Barbara , Santa Barbara, CA 93101 , USA.', '11 11 Center for Oceans, Conservation International , Honolulu, HI 96825 , USA.', '12 12 Julie Ann Wrigley Global Institute of Sustainability, Arizona State University , Tempe, AZ 85281 , USA.', ""13 13 Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Management, University of Hawai'i at Mānoa , Honolulu, HI 96822 , USA."", '14 14 Department of Biological Sciences, California Polytechnic State University , San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 , USA.']","Jean-Baptiste Jouffray, Lisa M Wedding, Albert V Norström, Mary K Donovan, Gareth J Williams, Larry B Crowder, Ashley L Erickson, Alan M Friedlander, Nicholas A J Graham, Jamison M Gove, Carrie V Kappel, John N Kittinger, Joey Lecky, Kirsten L L Oleson, Kimberly A Selkoe, Crow White, Ivor D Williams, Magnus Nyström, ",Proceedings.

405,Impact of Intracardiac Neurons on Cardiac Electrophysiology and Arrhythmogenesis in an Ex Vivo Langendorff System,"Since its invention in the late 19th century, the Langendorff ex vivo heart perfusion system continues to be a relevant tool for studying a broad spectrum of physiological, biochemical, morphological, and pharmacological parameters in centrally denervated hearts. Here, we describe a setup for the modulation of the intracardiac autonomic nervous system and the assessment of its influence on basic electrophysiology, arrhythmogenesis, and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) dynamics. The intracardiac autonomic nervous system is modulated by the mechanical dissection of atrial fat pads-in which murine ganglia are located mainly-or by the usage of global as well as targeted pharmacological interventions. An octapolar electrophysiological catheter is introduced into the right atrium and the right ventricle, and epicardial-placed multi-electrode arrays (MEA) for high-resolution mapping are used to determine cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmogenesis. Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging is performed for the real-time monitoring of cAMP levels in different cardiac regions. Neuromorphology is studied by means of antibody-based staining of whole hearts using neuronal markers to guide the identification and modulation of specific targets of the intracardiac autonomic nervous system in the performed studies. The ex vivo Langendorff setup allows for a high number of reproducible experiments in a short time. Nevertheless, the partly open nature of the setup (e.g., during MEA measurements) makes constant temperature control difficult and should be kept to a minimum. This described method makes it possible to analyze and modulate the intracardiac autonomic nervous system in decentralized hearts.","['1 Department of Cardiology-Electrophysiology, cNEP (cardiac Neuro- and Electrophysiology research group), University Heart Center, University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf; DZHK (German Center for Cardiovascular Research).', '2 DZHK (German Center for Cardiovascular Research); Institute of Experimental Cardiovascular Research, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf.', '3 Department of Cardiology-Electrophysiology, cNEP (cardiac Neuro- and Electrophysiology research group), University Heart Center, University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf.', '4 Department of Cardiology-Electrophysiology, cNEP (cardiac Neuro- and Electrophysiology research group), University Heart Center, University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf; DZHK (German Center for Cardiovascular Research); chr.meyer@uke.de.']","Christiane Jungen, Katharina Scherschel, Nadja I Bork, Pawel Kuklik, Christian Eickholt, Helge Kniep, Niklas Klatt, Stephan Willems, Viacheslav O Nikolaev, Christian Meyer, ",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29889210

      To compare the morphology and mechanical function of sutures in normal pigs and minipigs to those of Yucatan minipigs, a natural model for midfacial hypoplasia. Setting and sample population:
      
    

    
      Research took place at the Department of Orthodontics at the University of Washington and used varying sample sizes of normal-snouted pigs and Yucatan minipigs. Material and methods:
      
    

    
      Skulls and heads were examined for morphology of the nasofrontal suture using computed tomography and histology. Strain gauge recordings were made of sutural strain during mastication and during cyclic tensile loading of the nasofrontal suture. Results:
      
    

    
      Sutures in Yucatans had narrower gaps than same-age normal pigs. The nasofrontal suture was simpler in construction and had more active osteoblasts on the bone fronts in Yucatans. The sutural ligament was less well organized, and based on a small sample, masticatory strain appeared to be lower than in normal minipigs. However, sutures were not fused and showed similar strains in response to the cyclic loading procedure. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Midfacial hypoplasia in Yucatan pigs has the likely proximate cause of hyperossification.

Among them, a light-harvesting complex (LHC) composed of SPs and a photonic wire of phenanthrene, Cy3, Cy5, and Cy5.5 chromophores reveals a remarkable energy transfer efficiency of 59 %. Stepwise transfer of the excitation energy collected by the light-harvesting SPs via the intermediate Cy3 and Cy5 chromophores to the final Cy5.5 acceptor proceeds through a Förster resonance energy transfer mechanism.

However, the mechanism behind the enhancement of imaging depth needs further illumination. Here, the signal of a DA-OCT system is studied using a Monte Carlo simulation.

413,Burmese python target reflectivity compared to natural Florida foliage background reflectivity,"The Florida Everglades is infested with Burmese pythons caused by the release of exotic pets in the 1980s. The current estimates are between 30,000 and 300,000 pythons, where the result is a severe decline in Everglade mammals: 90% reductions in raccoon, opossum, bobcats, and foxes. The marsh rabbits are completely gone. The population of the pythons is rapidly increasing exponentially with 20-50 eggs per snake with a life span of up to 20 years. Pythons have been captured in the Everglades with lengths of nearly 6 m. Researchers in the state of Florida are concerned that these pythons are (1) permanently damaging the Everglades, (2) migrating further north into populated areas of Florida, and (3) endangering wildlife, pets, and eventually, people. There have been a number of sensing efforts attempted in the large-area detection of pythons, where limited success has been achieved. For example, infrared sensors have been applied to the problem, but the pythons are cold-blooded, so the infrared bands do not work well. Imec has leveraged its expertise and infrastructure in semiconductor processing to produce highly compact, higher performance, and relatively cheaper hyperspectral image sensors and camera systems. In this work, Imec teamed with the University of Florida and Extended Reality Systems to obtain hyperspectral reflectivity measurements of Burmese pythons along with natural Florida background foliage to determine bands or band combinations that may be exploited in the large-area detection of pythons. The bands investigated are the visible-near infrared (or VisNIR) and the shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands. The results show that there are enough differences in the data collection such that a single band, inexpensive VisNIR band camera may provide reasonable results and a two-band, VisNIR/SWIR combination may provide higher performance results.

However, there exist formidable challenges for them to sort label-free submicron particles with similar volume and refractive index yet distinct shapes. In this work, we report an optofluidic nanophotonic sawtooth array (ONSA) that generates sawtooth-like light fields through light coupling, paving the physical foundation for shape-selective sieving. Submicron particles interact with the coupled hotspots which impose different optical torques on the particles according to their shapes. Unstained S. aureus and E. coli are used as a model system to demonstrate this shape-selective sorting mechanism based on the torque-induced body dynamics, which was previously unattainable by other particle sorting technologies. More than 95% of S. aureus is retained within ONSA, while more than 97% of E. coli is removed. This nanophotonic chip offers a paradigm shift in shape-selective sorting of submicron particles and expands the boundary of optofluidics-based particle manipulation.","['1 School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering , Nanyang Technological University , Singapore 639798 , Singapore.', '2 School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering , Nanyang Technological University , Singapore 639798 , Singapore.', '3 Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering , National University of Singapore , Singapore 117583 , Singapore.', '4 School of Optoelectronic Engineering and Instrumentation Science , Dalian University of Technology , Dalian 116024 , China.', '5 School of Electronic and Optical Engineering , Nanjing University of Science and Technology , Nanjing , Jiangsu 210094 , China.', '6 Institute of Microelectronics , A*STAR (Agency for Science, Technology and Research) , 2 Fusionopolis Way, #08-02 Innovis Tower , Singapore 138634 , Singapore.', '7 Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine , Nanyang Technological University , Singapore 308232 , Singapore.', '8 School of Information Science & Engineering , Central South University , Changsha 410083 , China.', '9 Department of Physics and Institute for Advanced Study , The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology , Clear Water Bay , Hong Kong, China.']","Yuzhi Shi, Haitao Zhao, Kim Truc Nguyen, Yi Zhang, Lip Ket Chin, Tongtong Zhu, Yefeng Yu, Hong Cai, Peng Huat Yap, Patricia Yang Liu, Sha Xiong, Jingbo Zhang, Cheng-Wei Qiu, Che Ting Chan, Ai Qun Liu, ",ACS nano,2019,light-matter interactions; near field; optical binding; optical torques; shape sorting; silicon photonics.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31585042

Optical simulations of incoming light were generated using nonsequential ray-tracing software based on a collimated light source for various off-axis angles of illumination. The simulation analyses were verified using a laboratory in vitro bench-top glare measurement system. Results:
      
    

    
      The Clareon and Vivinex IOLs produced focused off-axis images with negligible peripheral glare characteristics. The Tecnis and enVista IOLs produced dispersed images with additional glare characteristics at 45 degrees of off-axis illumination and higher. The Eternity IOL showed the highest edge-reflected glare characteristic, likely because of its straight optic edge geometry. The laboratory bench images and glare intensity profiles were consistent with the simulation data. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      In vitro and nonsequential ray-tracing evaluations showed that straight optic edges and peripheral nonimaging optic geometry might contribute to positive dysphotopsia. The IOL designs with optic edge curvature and full functional optics demonstrated the lowest level of glare-type photic phenomena. Only clinical studies can confirm whether the differences observed between the IOLs in vitro are clinically significant.","['1 Alcon Laboratories, Ltd., Fort Worth, Texas, USA.

421,Multi-step material decomposition for spectral computed tomography,"Spectral images from photon counting detectors are being explored for material decomposition applications such as for obtaining quantitative maps of tissue types and contrast agents. While these detectors allow acquisition of multi-energy data in a single exposure, separating the total photon counts into multiple energy bins can lead to issues of count starvation and increased quantum noise in resultant maps. Furthermore, the complex decomposition problem is often solved in a single inversion step making it difficult to separate materials with close properties. We propose a multi-step decomposition method which allows solving the problem in multiple steps using the same spectral data collected in a single exposure. During each step, quantitative accuracy of a single material is under focus and one can flexibly optimize the bins chosen in that step. The result thus obtained becomes part of the input data for the next step in the multi-step process. This makes the problem less ill-conditioned and allows better quantitation of more challenging materials within the object. In comparison to a conventional single-step method, we show excellent quantitative accuracy for decomposing up to six materials involving a mix of soft tissue types and contrast agents in micro-CT sized digital phantoms.","['1 Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Houston, Houston, TX 77204, United States of America.']","Nathaniel R Fredette, Amar Kavuri, Mini Das, ",Physics in medicine and biology,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31216514
422,The role of the microenvironment in the biophysics of cancer,"During the last decades, cell mechanics has been recognized as a quantitative measure to discriminate between many physiological and pathological states of single cells. In the field of biophysics of cancer, a large body of research has been focused on the comparison between normal and cancer mechanics and slowly the hypothesis that cancer cells are softer than their normal counterparts has been accepted, even though in situ tumor tissue is usually stiffer than the surrounding normal tissue. This corroborates the idea that the extra-cellular matrix (ECM) has a critical role in regulating tumor cell properties and behavior. Rearrangements in ECM can lead to changes in cancer cell mechanics and in specific conditions the general assumption about cancer cell softening could be confuted. Here, we highlight the contribution of ECM in cancer cell mechanics and argue that the statement that cancer cells are softer than normal cells should be firmly related to the properties of cell environment and the specific stage of cancer cell progression. In particular, we will discuss that when employing cell mechanics in cancer diagnosis and discrimination, the chemical, the topographical and - last but not least - the mechanical properties of the microenvironment are very important.","['1 Institute of Biophysics, University of Bremen, Otto-Hahn Allee 1, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.', '2 Institute of Biophysics, University of Bremen, Otto-Hahn Allee 1, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.

This sensor is built on a SiO2-Si3N4-SiO2 optical planar waveguide (OPW) operating as a polarization interferometer (PI), which detects a phase shift between p- and s-components of polarized light propagating through the waveguide caused by the molecular adsorption. The refractive index sensitivity (RIS) of the recently upgraded PI experimental setup has been improved and reached values of around 9600 rad per refractive index unity (RIU), the highest RIS values reported, which enables the detection of low molecular weight analytes such as mycotoxins in very low concentrations. The biosensing tests yielded remarkable results for the detection of aflatoxin B1 in a wide range of concentrations from 1 pg/mL to 1 μg/mL in direct assay with specific DNA-based aptamers.

426,Monte Carlo Diffusion-Enhanced Photon Inference: Distance Distributions and Conformational Dynamics in Single-Molecule FRET,"Single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) is utilized to study the structure and dynamics of many biomolecules, such as proteins, DNA, and their various complexes. The structural assessment is based on the well-known Förster relationship between the measured efficiency of energy transfer between a donor (D) and an acceptor (A) dye and the distance between them. Classical smFRET analysis methods called photon distribution analysis (PDA) take into account photon shot-noise, D-A distance distribution, and, more recently, interconversion between states in order to extract accurate distance information. It is known that rapid D-A distance fluctuations on the order of the D lifetime (or shorter) can increase the measured mean FRET efficiency and thus decrease the estimated D-A distance. Nonetheless, this effect has been so far neglected in smFRET experiments, potentially leading to biases in estimated distances. Here we introduce a PDA approach dubbed Monte Carlo diffusion-enhanced photon inference (MC-DEPI). MC-DEPI recolor detected photons of smFRET experiments taking into account dynamics of D-A distance fluctuations, multiple interconverting states, and photoblinking. Using this approach, we show how different underlying conditions may yield identical FRET histograms and how the additional information from fluorescence decays helps in distinguishing between the different conditions. We also introduce a machine learning fitting approach for retrieving the D-A distance distribution, decoupled from the above-mentioned effects. We show that distance interpretation of smFRET experiments of even the simplest dsDNA is nontrivial and requires decoupling the effects of rapid D-A distance fluctuations on FRET in order to avoid systematic biases in the estimation of the D-A distance distribution.","['1 Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry , University of California Los Angeles , Los Angeles , California , United States.', '2 Department of Biological Chemistry, The Alexander Silberman Institute of Life Sciences , The Hebrew University , Jerusalem , Israel.']","Antonino Ingargiola, Shimon Weiss, Eitan Lerner, ",The journal of physical chemistry.

      A DPC PET/CT (Vereos, Philips) with 23,040 1-to-1 crystal-to-detector couplings was utilized. [18F]FDG PET/CT of a uniformity phantom and 10 oncology patients selected by block randomization from a large clinical trial were included (457 ± 38 MBq, 64 ± 22 min p.i, body mass index (BMI) of 14-41). Sparse-ring PET configurations with 50 % detector reduction in tangential and axial directions were analyzed and compared to the current full ring configuration.

However, conventional photon-counting instrumentations are bulky and expensive due to the use of conventional optics and a lack of optimization of electronics. In this paper, we present a portable, low-cost time-correlated single photon-counting (TCSPC) analysis system for DNA detection. Both optical and electronic subsystems are carefully designed to provide effective emission filtering and size reduction, delivering good DNA detection and fluorescence lifetime extraction performance. DNA detection has been verified by fluorescence lifetime measurements of a V-carbazole conjugated fluorophore lifetime bioassay. The time-to-digital module of the proposed TCSPC system achieves a full width at half maximum (FWHM) timing resolution from 121 to 145 ps and a differential non-linearity (DNL) between -8.5% and +9.7% of the least significant bit (LSB) within the 500 ns full-scale range (FSR).

430,A formalism for reference dosimetry in photon beams in the presence of a magnetic field,"A generic formalism is proposed for reference dosimetry in the presence of a magnetic field. Besides the regular correction factors from the conventional reference dosimetry formalisms, two factors are used to take into account magnetic field effects: (1) a dose conversion factor to correct for the change in local dose distribution and (2) a correction of the reading of the dosimeter used for the reference dosimetry measurements. The formalism was applied to the Elekta MRI-Linac, for which the 1.5 T magnetic field is orthogonal to the 7 MV photon beam. For this setup at reference conditions it was shown that the dose decreases with increasing magnetic field strength. The reduction in local dose for a 1.5 T transverse field, compared to no field is 0.51% ± 0.03% at the reference point of 10 cm depth. The effect of the magnetic field on the reading of the dosimeter was measured for two waterproof ionization chambers types (PTW 30013 and IBA FC65-G) before and after multiple ramp-up and ramp-downs of the magnetic field. The chambers were aligned perpendicular and parallel to the magnetic field. The corrections of the readings of the perpendicularly aligned chambers were 0.967 ± 0.002 and 0.957 ± 0.002 for respectively the PTW and IBA ionization chambers. In the parallel alignment the corrections were small; 0.997 ± 0.001 and 1.002 ± 0.003 for the PTW and IBA chamber respectively. The change in reading due to the magnetic field can be measured by individual departments. The proposed formalism can be used to determine the correction factors needed to establish the absorbed dose in a magnetic field. It requires Monte Carlo simulations of the local dose and measurements of the response of the dosimeter. The formalism was successfully implemented for the MRI-Linac and is applicable for other field strengths and geometries.","['1 Department of Radiotherapy, University Medical Center Utrecht, Heidelberglaan, 100, Utrecht 3584 CX, Netherlands.']","B van Asselen, S J Woodings, S L Hackett, T L van Soest, J G M Kok, B W Raaymakers, J W H Wolthaus, ",Physics in medicine and biology,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29786612

The characterization studies affirm the pivotal role of Eu3+ on the improved structural stability of ZTA and associated tetragonal zirconia (t-ZrO2 ) → cubic zirconia (c-ZrO2 ) transformation. Eu3+ prefers accommodation at the lattice sites of ZrO2 and their gradual accumulation induces t- → c-ZrO2 transition. Beyond the substitution limit, Eu3+ reacts with Al2 O3 to form EuAlO3 . Optical studies validate typical Eu3+ emissions, and further, the emission spectrum also predicts the symmetry of Eu3+ coordination at the ZrO2 lattice.

435,Polarimetric learning: a Siamese approach to learning distance metrics of algal Mueller matrix images,"Polarimetric measurements are becoming increasingly accurate and fast to perform in modern applications. However, analysis on the polarimetric data usually suffers from its high-dimensional nature spatially, temporally, or spectrally. This paper associates polarimetric techniques with metric learning algorithms, namely, polarimetric learning, by introducing a distance metric learning method called Siamese network that aims to learn good distance metrics of algal Mueller matrix images in low-dimensional feature spaces. As an experimental example, 12,162 Mueller matrix images of eight algal species are measured via a forward Mueller matrix microscope. Eight classical metric learning algorithms, including principle component analysis, multidimensional scaling, isometric feature mapping, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding, Laplacian eigenmaps, locally linear embedding, linear discriminant analysis, and metric learning to rank, are considered, by which the algal Mueller matrix images are mapped to two-dimensional (2D) feature spaces with different distance metrics. Support-vector-machine-based holdout sample classification accuracies of the 2D feature vectors are provided in a supervised manner for quantitative comparisons of the low-dimensional distance metrics, including the results of the eight metric learning algorithms and 16 Siamese architectures with varying convolution, inception, and full connection modules. This study shows that the Siamese approach is an effective metric learning algorithm that can adaptively extract features exhibiting empirical correlations with the fast-axis-orientation-dependent and spatially variant algal retardance induced by the algal microstructures.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Xianpeng Li, Ran Liao, Hui Ma, Priscilla T Y Leung, Meng Yan, ",Applied optics,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29791349
436,4D blood flow model for dose calculation to circulating blood and lymphocytes,"To better understand how radiotherapy delivery parameters affect the depletion of circulating lymphocytes in patients treated for intra-cranial tumors, we developed a computational human body blood flow model (BFM), that enables to estimate the dose to the circulating blood during the course of fractionated radiation therapy. A hemodynamic cardiovascular system based on human body reference values was developed to distribute the cardiac output to 24 different organs, described by a discrete Markov Chain. For explicit intracranial blood flow modeling, we extracted major cerebral vasculature from MRI data of a patient and complemented them with an extension network of generic vessels in the frontal and occipital lobes to guarantee even overall blood supply to the entire brain volume. An explicit Monte Carlo simulation was implemented to track the propagation of each individual blood particle (BP) through the brain and time-dependent radiation fields, accumulating dose along their trajectories. The cerebral model includes 1050 path lines and explicitly simulates more than 266 000 BP at any given time that are tracked with a time resolution of 10 ms. The entire BFM for the whole body contains 22 178 000 BP, corresponding to 4200 BP per ml of blood. We have used the model to investigate the difference between proton and photon therapy, and the effect of different dose rates and patient characteristics on the dose to the circulating blood pool. The mean dose to the blood pool is estimated to be 0.06 and 0.13 Gy after 30 fractions of proton and photon therapy, respectively, and the highest dose to 1% of blood was found to be 0.19 Gy and 0.34 Gy. The fraction of blood volume receiving any dose after the first fraction is significantly lower for proton therapy, 10.1% compared to 18.4% for the photon treatment plan. 90% of the blood pool will have received dose after the 11th fraction using photon therapy compared to the 21st fraction with proton therapy. Higher dose rates can effectively reduce the fraction of blood irradiated to low doses but increase the amount of blood receiving high doses. Patient characteristics such as blood pressure, gender and age lead to smaller effects than variations in the dose rate. We developed a 4D human BFM including recirculating to estimate the radiation dose to the circulating blood during intracranial treatment and demonstrate its application to proton- versus photon-based delivery, various dose rates and patient characteristics. The radiation dose estimation to the circulating blood provides us better insight into the origins of radiation-induced lymphopenia.","['1 Department of Radiation Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States of America.']","Abdelkhalek Hammi, Harald Paganetti, Clemens Grassberger, ",Physics in medicine and biology,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32119649

The visceral theory of sleep,"Electrophysiological methods of studying the nervous system have opened up new opportunities for investigations of sleep. Striking changes in the pattern of EEG during the transition from wakefulness to sleep made it's recording a mandatory element of any somnological research. It was also found that the frequency of neuronal firing in the cerebral cortex during sleep does not decrease, but can significantly exceed the average level of the cortical activity during wakefulness. But it remained the main mystery of sleep, what was associated with this high activity of cortical neurons at a time when the thresholds of sensory perception raised and the propagation of signals from the outside world and from the own body towards the cerebral cortex were almost blocked. The resolution of this paradoxical situation was suggested by the visceral theory of sleep. This theory was based on the assumption that during sleep interoceptive afferentation from all visceral systems of the body arrives for analysis into the cerebral cortex. This article offers an overview of the studies performed for direct experimental verification of non-trivial predictions of this theory.","['1 Institute for Information Transmission Problems RAS, Moscow, Russia.', '2 Institute of Higher Nervous Activity and Neurophysiology RAS, Moscow, Russia.']","I N Pigarev, M L Pigareva, ",Zhurnal nevrologii i psikhiatrii imeni S.S.

439,Development of an attenuation correction method for direct x-ray fluorescence (XRF) imaging utilizing gold L-shell XRF photons,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      This work proposes a semiempirical correction method for attenuation of x-ray fluorescence (XRF) photons and/or an excitation beam during direct XRF imaging (i.e., mapping) of gold nanoparticle (GNP) distribution utilizing gold L-shell XRF photons. Methods:
      
    

    
      The current method was first devised by finding the two following relationships: (a) ratio of gold XRF peak intensity (Lα at ~9.7 keV and Lβ at ~11.4 keV) vs pathlength of XRF photons; (b) XRF photon counts produced (Nxrf ) vs scattered photon counts produced (Nscat ). Monte Carlo simulations were performed using the Geant4 tool kit to characterize the aforementioned relationships for different tissue-like media. The applicability of the method was tested experimentally by acquiring 2D L-shell XRF images of custom-made phantoms using an experimental benchtop x-ray fluorescence computed tomography setup. Results:
      
    

    
      The results show that the ratio of gold L-shell XRF peak intensities allowed an estimation of the pathlength of XRF photons, thus can be utilized to correct for attenuation of XRF photons after emission. The results also demonstrate that Nscat , through a proportionality  N xrf  ∝ N scat T   where the exponent T depends on the energy of scattered photons, could be used to correct for attenuation of an excitation beam prior to producing XRF photons. The corrected XRF signal was found independent of the densities of tissue-like media present along the passage of an excitation beam or emitted XRF photons. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The current results suggest that the developed attenuation correction method plays an essential role for the detection of GNPs on the order of parts-per-million, and also for the determination of GNP concentration/location within the imaging object made of tissue-like media, without any prior knowledge of the imaging object shape, under the conditions deemed relevant to biomedical applications of gold L-shell XRF-based imaging.","['1 Department of Radiation Physics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', '2 Department of Radiation Physics, Department of Imaging Physics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.']","Md Foiez Ahmed, Selcuk Yasar, Sang Hyun Cho, ",Medical physics,2018 Dec,Geant4; Monte Carlo; attenuation correction; gold nanoparticles; x-ray fluorescence imaging.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30307623

441,Dissecting hiPSC-CM pacemaker function in a cardiac organoid model,"Biological pacemakers could be a promising alternative to electronic pacemakers and human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM) may represent a suitable source for implantable cells. To further unravel this potential a thorough understanding of pacemaker function with regard to coupling processes both in the physiological and in the graft-host context is required. Here we developed a 2-component cardiac organoid model with a hiPSC-CM embryoid body (EB) as trigger casted into a rat engineered heart tissue (EHT) as arrhythmic beating substrate. Contractility recordings revealed that the EB controlled the beating activity of the EHT, leading to a regular hiPSC-CM-like beating pattern instead of the irregular beating typically seen in rat EHT. Connectivity was observed with action potential (AP) measurements and calcium transients transmitting from the EB directly into the rat EHT. Immunohistochemistry and genetically labeled hiPSC-CMs demonstrated that EB-derived and rat cells intermingled and formed a transitional zone. Connexin 43 expression followed the same pattern as histological and computer models have indicated for the human sinoatrial node. In conclusion, hiPSC-CM EBs function as a biological pacemaker in a 2-component cardiac organoid model, which provides the possibility to study electrophysiological and structural coupling mechanisms underlying propagation of pacemaker activity.","['1 University Medical Center Hamburg Eppendorf, Institute of Experimental Pharmacology and Toxicology, 20246, Hamburg, Germany; German Centre for Cardiovascular Research (DZHK), partner site Hamburg/Kiel/Lübeck, Hamburg, Germany.', '2 University Medical Center Hamburg Eppendorf, Institute of Experimental Pharmacology and Toxicology, 20246, Hamburg, Germany; German Centre for Cardiovascular Research (DZHK), partner site Hamburg/Kiel/Lübeck, Hamburg, Germany; University Heart Center Hamburg, Department of Cardiology-Electrophysiology, Hamburg, Germany.', '3 University Medical Center Hamburg Eppendorf, Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology, 20246, Hamburg, Germany.', '4 German Centre for Cardiovascular Research (DZHK), partner site Hamburg/Kiel/Lübeck, Hamburg, Germany; University Heart Center Hamburg, Department of Cardiology-Electrophysiology, Hamburg, Germany.', '5 University Medicine Rostock, Department for Heart Surgery, Schillingallee 35, 18057, Rostock, Germany; University Rostock, Department of Life, Light & Matter, Albert-Einstein-Str. 25, 18059, Rostock, Germany.', '6 University Medical Center Hamburg Eppendorf, Research Department Cell and Gene Therapy, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, 20246, Hamburg, Germany.', '7 University Medical Center Hamburg Eppendorf, Institute of Experimental Pharmacology and Toxicology, 20246, Hamburg, Germany; German Centre for Cardiovascular Research (DZHK), partner site Hamburg/Kiel/Lübeck, Hamburg, Germany.

These qualities make it well suited for discovery of aberrant neural mechanisms that underlie complicated disease states. This technique is routinely utilized in vitro, in vivo, and in outpatient neurological clinics, offering a translatable bridge between animal models and human patients. The bench-to-bedside potential of this approach is unparalleled, yet it also remains undeveloped due to the slow inertia of legacy techniques and interpretations. In this review, I discuss these strengths of the method, and I detail compelling reasons why future advancements can have a direct and tangible influence over clinical practice.

Polypyrrole-coated cellulose nanocrystals and cellulose nanofibers were prepared using iron(III) chloride (FeCl3) oxidant, which were used to reinforce polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). The combination of weak H-bonds and iron coordination bonds and the synergistic effect of these components yielded self-healing nanocomposite films with robust mechanical strength (409% increase compared to pure PVA and high toughness up to 407.1%) and excellent adhesion (9670 times greater than its own weight) to various substrates in air and water. When damaged, the nanocomposite films displayed good mechanical (72.0-76.3%) and conductive (54.9-91.2%) recovery after a healing time of 30 min. More importantly, the flexible nanocomposites possessed high strain sensitivity under subtle strains (<48.5%) with a gauge factor (GF) of 2.52, which was relatively larger than the GF of ionic hydrogel-based skin sensors. These nanocomposite films possessed superior sensing performance for real-time monitoring of large and subtle human motions (finger bending motions, swallowing, and wrist pulse); thus, they have great potentials in health monitoring, smart flexible skin sensors. and wearable electronic devices.","['1 Department of Chemical Engineering, Waterloo Institute for Nanotechnology , University of Waterloo , 200 University Avenue West , Waterloo N2L 3G1 , Ontario , Canada.', '2 Key Laboratory of Advanced Textile Materials and Manufacturing Technology, Ministry of Education, Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Fiber Materials and Manufacturing Technology, School of Materials Science and Engineering , Zhejiang Sci-Tech University , Xiasha Higher Education Park Avenue 2 No. 928 , Hangzhou 310018 , Zhejiang , China.', '3 School of Chemical Engineering , Xuzhou College of Industrial Technology , No. 1 Xiangwang Road , Xuzhou 221140 , Jiangsu , China.']","Lian Han, Songbo Cui, Hou-Yong Yu, Meili Song, Haoyu Zhang, Nathan Grishkewich, Congguo Huang, Daesung Kim, Kam Michael Chiu Tam, ",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019,cellulose nanocrystals; cellulose nanofibers; nanocomposites; polypyrrole; skin sensors.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31684724
445,Mimicking Biological Synaptic Functionality with an Indium Phosphide Synaptic Device on Silicon for Scalable Neuromorphic Computing,"Neuromorphic or ""brain-like"" computation is a leading candidate for efficient, fault-tolerant processing of large-scale data as well as real-time sensing and transduction of complex multivariate systems and networks such as self-driving vehicles or Internet of Things applications. In biology, the synapse serves as an active memory unit in the neural system and is the component responsible for learning and memory. Electronically emulating this element via a compact, scalable technology which can be integrated in a three-dimensional (3-D) architecture is critical for future implementations of neuromorphic processors. However, present day 3-D transistor implementations of synapses are typically based on low-mobility semiconductor channels or technologies that are not scalable. Here, we demonstrate a crystalline indium phosphide (InP)-based artificial synapse for spiking neural networks that exhibits elasticity, short-term plasticity, long-term plasticity, metaplasticity, and spike timing-dependent plasticity, emulating the critical behaviors exhibited by biological synapses. Critically, we show that this crystalline InP device can be directly integrated via back-end processing on a Si wafer using a SiO2 buffer without the need for a crystalline seed, enabling neuromorphic devices that can be implemented in a scalable and 3-D architecture. Specifically, the device is a crystalline InP channel field-effect transistor that interacts with neuron spikes by modification of the population of filled traps in the MOS structure itself. Unlike other transistor-based implementations, we show that it is possible to mimic these biological functions without the use of external factors (e.g., surface adsorption of gas molecules) and without the need for the high electric fields necessary for traditional flash-based implementations. Finally, when exposed to neuronal spikes with a waveform similar to that observed in the brain, these devices exhibit the ability to learn without the need for any external potentiating/depressing circuits, mimicking the biological process of Hebbian learning.","['1 Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California , Los Angeles, California 90089, United States.']","Debarghya Sarkar, Jun Tao, Wei Wang, Qingfeng Lin, Matthew Yeung, Chenhao Ren, Rehan Kapadia, ",ACS nano,2018,Si back-end processing; indium phosphide; metaplasticity; neuromorphic computing; spike timing-dependent plasticity; synaptic device; templated liquid-phase growth.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29328623

448,"A Monte Carlo-based dosimetric characterization of Esteya ® , an electronic surface brachytherapy unit","Purpose:
      
    

    
      The purpose of this work is threefold: First, to obtain the phase space of an electronic brachytherapy (eBT) system designed for surface skin treatments. Second, to explore the use of some efficiency enhancing (EFEN) strategies in the determination of the phase space. Third, to use the phase space previously obtained to perform a dosimetric characterization of the Esteya eBT system. Methods:
      
    

    
      The Monte Carlo study of the 69.5 kVp x-ray beam of the Esteya® unit (Elekta Brachytherapy, Veenendaal, The Netherlands) was performed with PENELOPE2014. The EFEN strategies included the use of variance reduction techniques and mixed Class II simulations, where transport parameters were fine-tuned. Four source models were studied varying the most relevant parameters characterizing the electron beam impinging the target: the energy spectrum (mono-energetic or Gaussian shaped), and the electron distribution over the focal spot (uniform or Gaussian shaped). Phase spaces obtained were analyzed to detect differences in the calculated data due to the EFEN strategy or the source configuration. Depth dose curves and absorbed dose profiles were obtained for each source model and compared to experimental data previously published. Results:
      
    

    
      In our EFEN strategy, the interaction forcing variance reduction (VRIF) technique increases efficiency by a factor ~20. Tailoring the transport parameters values (C1 and C2) does not increase the efficiency in a significant way. Applying a universal cutoff energy EABS of 10 keV saves 84% of CPU time while showing negligible impact on the calculated results. Disabling the electron transport by imposing an electron energy cutoff of 70 keV (except for the target) saves an extra 8% (losing in the process 1.2% of the photons). The Gaussian energy source (FWHM = 10%, centered at the nominal kVp, homogeneous electron distribution) shows characteristic K-lines in its energy spectrum, not observed experimentally. The average photon energy using an ideal source (mono-energetic, homogeneous electron distribution) was 36.19 ± 0.09 keV, in agreement with the published measured data of 36.2 ± 0.2 keV. The use of a Gaussian-distributed electron source (mono-energetic) increases the penumbra by 50%, which is closer to the measurement results. The maximum discrepancy of the calculated percent depth dose with the corresponding measured values is 4.5% (at the phantom surface, less than 2% beyond 1 mm depth) and 5% (for the 80% of the field) in the dose profile. Our results agree with the findings published by other authors and are consistent within the expected Type A and B uncertainties. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our results agree with the published measurement results within the reported uncertainties. The observed differences in PDD, dose profiles, and photon spectrum come from three main sources of uncertainty: intermachine variations, measurements, and Monte Carlo calculations. It has been observed that a mono-energetic source with a Gaussian electron distribution over the focal spot is a suitable choice to reproduce the experimental data.","['1 Department of Atomic, Molecular and Nuclear Physics, University of Valencia, Burjassot, 46100, Spain.', '2 Radiotherapy Department, Centro Oncológico de Antofagasta, Los Pumas, 10255, Antofagasta, Chile.', '3 R&D Elekta Brachytherapy, Waardgelder 1, 3905 TH, Veenendaal, The Netherlands.', '4 Unidad Mixta de Investigación en Radiofísica e Instrumentación Nuclear en Medicina (IRIMED), Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria La Fe (IIS-La Fe)-Universitat de Valencia (UV), E-46026, Valencia, Spain.', '5 Radiotherapy Department, La Fe Hospital, E-46026, Valencia, Spain.', '6 Unidad Mixta de Investigación en Radiofísica e Instrumentación Nuclear en Medicina (IRIMED), Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria La Fe (IIS-La Fe)-Universitat de Valencia (UV), Burjassot, 46100, Spain.']","Christian Valdes-Cortez, Yury Niatsetski, Jose Perez-Calatayud, Facundo Ballester, Javier Vijande, ",Medical physics,2019 Jan,Monte Carlo simulation; dosimetry; electronic brachytherapy; simulation efficiency; surface treatment; x-ray source.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30390317

450,Radiation Field Strengths Near Cylindrical Volume Sources Via Point-source Correction Factors,"Due to the ease with which the radiation field strength is determined for a point source, the field strength emanating from radiopharmaceutical therapy patients is sometimes estimated by using the point source approximation with a correction factor. It is inevitable that the correction factor will occasionally be used under conditions that do not precisely match those for which the factor was originally derived. The difficulty is that the boundary of the correction factor's domain of acceptability is usually unclear. The purpose of this paper is to address this issue. The patient is modeled as a cylinder containing the radionuclide administered to the patient. From first principles, the expression for converting the radiation field strength of an unshielded point source to that of the extended cylindrical volume source is derived. This expression is analytically separated into the component depicting geometric dispersion of the source material into the volume and the component depicting self-absorption (absorption characteristics of I in water are used). These components, along with their composite, are presented showing their dependence on patient size, distance from the patient, and various dispersion patterns of the source material within the patient. Correlation of theory and measurement is demonstrated, and a conceptual grasp is conveyed regarding field strength variations around volume sources with changes in shape, size, distance, and other parameters. Using data presented, the radiation field strength emanating from a radiopharmaceutical therapy patient can be estimated from the point source approximation and customized for patient size and presumed internal radionuclide distribution.","['1 5234 Nobis Ct., Davenport, IA 52802.']","Palmer G Steward, ",Health physics,2019 Jan,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30489367

Continuous-wave lasing at room temperature is critical for integration with opto-electronic devices and optimal modulation of optical interactions4,5. Plasmonic nanocavities integrated with gain can generate coherent light at subwavelength scales6-9, beyond the diffraction limit that constrains mode volumes in dielectric cavities such as semiconducting nanowires10,11. However, insufficient gain with respect to losses and thermal instabilities in nanocavities has limited all nanoscale lasers to pulsed pump sources and/or low-temperature operation6-9,12-15. Here, we show continuous-wave upconverting lasing at room temperature with record-low thresholds and high photostability from subwavelength plasmons. We achieve selective, single-mode lasing from Yb3+/Er3+-co-doped upconverting nanoparticles conformally coated on Ag nanopillar arrays that support a single, sharp lattice plasmon cavity mode and greater than wavelength λ/20 field confinement in the vertical dimension. The intense electromagnetic near-fields localized in the vicinity of the nanopillars result in a threshold of 70 W cm-2, orders of magnitude lower than other small lasers. Our plasmon-nanoarray upconverting lasers provide directional, ultra-stable output at visible frequencies under near-infrared pumping, even after six hours of constant operation, which offers prospects in previously unrealizable applications of coherent nanoscale light.","['1 The Molecular Foundry, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA.', '2 Graduate Program in Applied Physics, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA.', '3 Trilo Therapeutics, San Francisco, CA, USA.', '4 Department of Chemistry, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA.', '5 The Molecular Foundry, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA. p.j.schuck@columbia.edu.', '6 Department of Mechanical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. p.j.schuck@columbia.edu.', '7 Graduate Program in Applied Physics, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA. todom@northwestern.edu.', '8 Department of Chemistry, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA. todom@northwestern.edu.', '9 Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA. todom@northwestern.edu.']","Angel Fernandez-Bravo, Danqing Wang, Edward S Barnard, Ayelet Teitelboim, Cheryl Tajon, Jun Guan, George C Schatz, Bruce E Cohen, Emory M Chan, P James Schuck, Teri W Odom, ",Nature materials,2019 Nov,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31548631

The purpose of the current study was to investigate the shielding properties of the bismuth-silicon (Bi-Si) composite containing varying percentages of micro- and nano-sized Bi particles for low-energy X-rays. Radiation composite shields composed of nano- and micro-sized Bi particles in Si-based matrix were constructed. The mass attenuation coefficients of the designed shields were experimentally assessed for diagnostic radiology energy range. In addition, the mass attenuation coefficients of the composite were comprehensively investigated using the MCNPX Monte Carlo (MC) code and XCOM. The X-ray attenuation for two different micro-sized Bi composites of radii of 50 µm and 0.50 µm showed enhancement in the range of 37-79% and 5-24%, respectively, for mono-energy photons (60-150 keV). Furthermore, the experimental and MC results indicated that nano-structured composites had higher photon attenuation properties (approximately 11-18%) than those of micro-sized samples for poly-energy X-ray photons. The amount of radiation attenuation for lower energies was more than that of higher energies. Thus, it was found that the shielding properties of composites were considerably strengthened by adding Bi nano-particles for lower energy photons.","['1 Medical Radiation Sciences Research Team, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', '2 Department of Medical Physics, School of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', '3 Student Research Committee, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', '4 Molecular Medicine Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran. amesbahi2010@gmail.com.', '5 Medical Physics Department, Medical School, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Attar Street, Tabriz, Iran. amesbahi2010@gmail.com.']","Reza Malekzadeh, Parinaz Mehnati, Mohammad Yousefi Sooteh, Asghar Mesbahi, ",Radiological physics and technology,2019 Sep,Bismuth; Composite shield; MCNPX; Mass attenuation coefficient; Nano-particles.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31385155

Of recent, photonic devices have also been adopted.

Thus, it is important to examine its biophysical and physiological source in order to optimize, model and accurately interpret fMRI. Animal models have been used to investigate these issues to take systematic measurements and combine with conventional invasive approaches. Here, we reviewed and discussed multiple issues, including the echo time-dependent intravascular contribution and extravascular contributions, gradient-echo vs. spin-echo fMRI, the physiological source of BOLD fMRI, arterial vs. venous cerebral blood volume change, cerebral oxygen consumption change, and arterial oxygen saturation change. We then discuss future directions of animal fMRI and translation to human fMRI. Systematic biophysical BOLD fMRI studies provide insight into the modeling and interpretation of BOLD fMRI in animals and humans.","['1 Center for Neuroscience Imaging Research, Institute for Basic Science, Suwon, Republic of Korea; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Republic of Korea.

459,Influence of speech-language therapy on P300 outcome in patients with language disorders: a meta-analysis,"Introduction:
      
    

    
      The patient's evolution in the audiology and speech-language clinic acts as a motivator of the therapeutic process, contributing to patient adherence to the treatment and allowing the therapist to review and/or maintain their clinical therapeutic conducts. Electrophysiological measures, such as the P300 evoked potential, help in the evaluation, understanding and monitoring of human communication disorders, thus facilitating the prognosis definition in each case. Objective:
      
    

    
      To determine whether the audiology and speech-language therapy influences the variation of P300 latency and amplitude in patients with speech disorders undergoing speech therapy. Methods:
      
    

    
      This is a systematic review with meta-analysis, in which the following databases were searched: Pubmed, ScienceDirect, SCOPUS, Web of Science, SciELO and LILACS, in addition to the gray literature bases: OpenGrey.eu and DissOnline. The inclusion criteria were randomized or non-randomized clinical trials, without language or date restriction, which evaluated children with language disorders undergoing speech therapy, monitored by P300, compared to children without intervention. Results:
      
    

    
      The mean difference between the latencies in the group submitted to therapy and the control group was -20.12ms with a 95% confidence interval of -43.98 to 3.74ms (p=0.08, I2=25% and p value=0.26). The mean difference between the amplitudes of the group submitted to therapy and the control group was 0.73uV with a 95% confidence interval of -1.77 to 3.23uV (p=0.57, I2=0% and p value=0.47). Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The present meta-analysis demonstrates that speech therapy does not influence the latency and amplitude results of the P300 evoked potential in children undergoing speech therapy intervention.","['1 Universidade Estadual de Ciências da Saúde de Alagoas (UNCISAL), Maceió, AL, Brazil.', '2 Universidade Estadual de Ciências da Saúde de Alagoas (UNCISAL), Maceió, AL, Brazil; Universidade de São Paulo (USP), Física Aplicada à Medicina, São Paulo, SP, Brazil.', '3 Universidade Estadual de Ciências da Saúde de Alagoas (UNCISAL), Fonoaudiologia, Maceió, AL, Brazil.', '4 Universidade Estadual de Ciências da Saúde de Alagoas (UNCISAL), Fonoaudiologia, Maceió, AL, Brazil; Universidade Federal de São Paulo (UNIFESP), Distúrbios da Comunicação Humana, São Paulo, SP, Brazil.', '5 Universidade Estadual de Ciências da Saúde de Alagoas (UNCISAL), Maceió, AL, Brazil; Universidade Federal de São Paulo (UNIFESP), Distúrbios da Comunicação Humana, São Paulo, SP, Brazil.', '6 Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP), Programa de Pós-Graduação em Fonoaudiologia, São Paulo, SP, Brazil; Universidade de São Paulo (USP), Neurologia, São Paulo, SP, Brazil.', '7 Universidade Federal de Alagoas (UFAL), Rede Nordeste de Biotecnologia (RENORBIO), Biotecnologia em Saúde, Maceió, AL, Brazil.

460,A comparison of a brachytherapy and an external beam radiotherapy boost in breast-conserving therapy for breast cancer: local and any recurrences,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      Adding a tumour bed boost to whole-breast irradiation in breast-conserving therapy reduces local recurrence rates. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether the boost technique influences the magnitude of the effect. Methods:
      
    

    
      Patients treated with breast-conserving therapy for invasive breast cancer between 2000 and 2007 were included in the analysis. Three groups were considered according to the applied boost technique: electrons, brachytherapy or photons. The endpoints were local recurrence and any recurrence. Cox regression models were used and correction for the confounders in the association between boost technique and outcome was performed using multivariable models. Results:
      
    

    
      1879 tumours were included in the analysis. 1448 tumours (77.1%) were treated with an electron boost, 334 (17.8%) with a brachytherapy boost and 97 (5.2%) with a photon boost. Median follow-up was 13.1 years. The 10-year local recurrence rate was 2.2%. In multivariable analysis with correction for age, pathological Tumour or Node stage (pT, pN), chemotherapy and hormonal therapy, there was no significant difference between the three groups for the local recurrence risk (p = 0.89). 10-year any recurrence rate was 10.8%. In multivariable analysis with correction for age, pT, pN, resection margins, radiotherapy, year of diagnosis, chemotherapy and hormonal therapy, there was no significant difference between the brachytherapy group and the electron group or the photon group (p = 0.11 and p = 0.28, respectively). The photon group had more recurrences compared to the electron group (Hazard Ratio 1.81, 95% Confidence Interval 1.12; 2.92, p = 0.02). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The local recurrence risk reduction of the tumour bed boost in breast-conserving therapy is not influenced by the applied boost technique.","['1 Department of Oncology, Experimental Radiation Oncology, KU Leuven-University of Leuven, 3000, Leuven, Belgium.

461,Hemagglutinin-Mediated Membrane Fusion: A Biophysical Perspective,"Influenza hemagglutinin (HA) is a viral membrane protein responsible for the initial steps of the entry of influenza virus into the host cell. It mediates binding of the virus particle to the host-cell membrane and catalyzes fusion of the viral membrane with that of the host. HA is therefore a major target in the development of antiviral strategies. The fusion of two membranes involves high activation barriers and proceeds through several intermediate states. Here, we provide a biophysical description of the membrane fusion process, relating its kinetic and thermodynamic properties to the large conformational changes taking place in HA and placing these in the context of multiple HA proteins working together to mediate fusion. Furthermore, we highlight the role of novel single-particle experiments and computational approaches in understanding the fusion process and their complementarity with other biophysical approaches.","['1 Zernike Institute for Advanced Materials, University of Groningen, 9747 AG Groningen, The Netherlands; email: s.boonstra@rug.nl , j.s.blijleven@rug.nl , w.h.roos@rug.nl , p.r.onck@rug.nl , e.van.der.giessen@rug.nl.', '2 School of Chemistry; Faculty of Science, Medicine and Health; University of Wollongong, Wollongong, New South Wales 2522, Australia; email: vanoijen@uow.edu.au.']","Sander Boonstra, Jelle S Blijleven, Wouter H Roos, Patrick R Onck, Erik van der Giessen, Antoine M van Oijen, ",Annual review of biophysics,2018,hemagglutinin; influenza cell entry; membrane fusion; modeling; single-particle; viral fusion.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29494252
462,Structural Characterization of Glycosaminoglycan Carbohydrates Using Ultraviolet Photodissociation,"Structural characterization of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) by mass spectrometry has long been a formidable analytical challenge owing to their high structural variability and the propensity for sulfate decomposition upon activation with low-energy ion activation methods. While derivatization and complexation workflows have aimed to generate informative spectra using low-energy ion activation methods, alternative ion activation methods present the opportunity to obtain informative spectra from native GAG structures. Both electron- and photon-based activation methods, including electron detachment dissociation (EDD), negative electron transfer dissociation (NETD), and extreme ultraviolet photon activation, have been explored previously to overcome the limitations associated with low-energy activation methods for GAGs and other sulfated oligosaccharides. Further, implementation of such methods on high-resolution mass spectrometers has aided the interpretation of the complex spectra generated. Here, we explore ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD) implemented on an Orbitrap mass spectrometer as another option for structural characterization of GAGs. UVPD spectra for both dermatan and heparan sulfate structures display extensive fragmentation including both glycosidic and cross-ring cleavages with the extent of sulfate retention comparable to that observed by EDD and NETD. In addition, the relatively short activation time of UVPD makes it promising for higher throughput analysis of GAGs in complex mixtures.","['1 Department of Chemistry , The University of Texas at Austin , Austin , Texas 78712 , United States.', '2 Department of Environmental Health Science , The University of Georgia , Athens , Georgia 30602 , United States.', '3 Department of Chemistry , The University of Georgia , Athens , Georgia 30602 , United States.']","Dustin R Klein, Franklin E Leach 3rd, I Jonathan Amster, Jennifer S Brodbelt, ",Analytical chemistry,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30932467
463,Electrophysiologic Considerations After Sudden Cardiac Arrest,"Background:
      
    

    
      Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD) remains a major public health concern, accounting for more than 50% of cardiac deaths. The majority of these deaths are related to ischemic heart disease, however increasingly recognized are non-ischemic causes such as cardiac channelopathies. Bradyarrhythmias and pulseless electrical activity comprise a larger proportion of out-ofhospital arrests than previously realized, particularly in patients with more advanced heart failure or noncardiac triggers such as pulmonary embolism. Patients surviving Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA) have a substantial risk of recurrence, particularly within 18 months post event. The timing of tachyarrhythmias complicating acute infarction has important implications regarding the likelihood of recurrence, with those occurring within 48 hours having a more favorable long-term outcome. In the absence of a clear reversible cause, implantable cardioverter defibrillators remain the mainstay in the secondary prevention of SCD. Post defibrillation electromechanical dissociation is common in patients with cardiomyopathy and can lead to SCD despite successful defibrillation of the primary tachyarrhythmia. Antiarrhythmic agents are highly effective in preventing recurrent arrhythmias in specific diseases such as the congenital long QT syndrome. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Catheter ablation is used most commonly to prevent recurrent ICD therapies in patients with structural heart disease-related ventricular arrhythmias, however recent publications have shown substantial benefit in other entities such as idiopathic ventricular fibrillation.","['1 Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Arizona College of Medicine, Tucson, AZ, United States.']","Prakash Suryanarayana, Hyon-He K Garza, Jacob Klewer, Mathew D Hutchinson, ",Current cardiology reviews,2018,"Electrophysiologic considerations; cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs); coronary artery disease; mortality; sudden

Recent revolutionary advances in optical imaging, however, make this approach more and more unhelpful: How are we to describe two-photon imaging, FRET, localization microscopy, and a host of related techniques to students who think of light primarily as a wave? I was surprised to find that everything I wanted my biophysics students to know about light, including image formation, x-ray diffraction, and even Bessel beams, could be expressed as well (or better) from the quantum viewpoint pioneered by Richard Feynman. Even my undergraduate students grasp this viewpoint as well as (or better than) the traditional one, and by mid-semester they are already well positioned to integrate the latest advances into their understanding. Moreover, I have found that this approach clarifies my own understanding of new techniques.","['1 Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

466,Real-time detection and monitoring of the drug resistance of single myeloid leukemia cells by diffused total internal reflection,"Real-time detection and monitoring of the drug resistance of single cells have important significance in clinical diagnosis and therapy. Traditional methods operate a number of times for each individual concentration, and innovation is required for the design of more simple and efficient manipulation platforms with necessary higher sensitivity. Here, we have developed a novel diffused total internal reflection (TIR) method to perform drug metabolism and cytotoxicity analysis of trapped myeloid leukemia cells. Molm-13 cells, a type of acute myeloid leukemia cell, were chosen and injected into the device and fittingly captured by cell traps. Differing from previous studies, a series of different concentrations of azelaic acid (AZA) drug could be used from 0 mM to 50 mM through convection and diffusion processes in a single chip, with each concentration region featuring 50 cells, with a total of 549 cell trapping units. Thanks to the high sensitivity of the TIR method, only cells with the same drug concentration could be illuminated in the detection process. By adjusting the incident angle, we could exactly detect and monitor the drug resistance of the cells using different drug concentrations and the experimental resolution of the drug concentration was as small as 5 mM. Images of the membrane integrity and morphology of the cells in the bright field were measured and we also monitored the cell viabilities in the dark field over 2 hours. The effects of AZA on the Molm-13 cells were explored in different concentrations at the single cell level. Compared with the results of the traditional MTT assay method, the experimental results are more simple and accurate. A cell death of 5% at an AZA concentration of 5 mM was observed after 30 minutes, while a concentration of 40 mM corresponded to a 98% cell death. The designed method in this study provides a novel toolkit to control and monitor drug resistance at the single cell level more easily with higher sensitivity and we believe it has significant potential application in single cell quality assessment and medicine analysis in clinical practice.","['1 School of Physics & technology, Key Laboratory of Artificial Micro/Nano Structure of Ministry of Education, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, China. yangyiys@whu.edu.cn.']","L Liang, Y X Jin, X Q Zhu, F L Zhou, Y Yang, ",Lab on a chip,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29713720
467,Bacterial Nanobionics via 3D Printing,"Investigating the multidimensional integration between different microbiological kingdoms possesses potential toward engineering next-generation bionic architectures. Bacterial and fungal kingdom exhibits mutual symbiosis that can offer advanced functionalities to these bionic architectures. Moreover, functional nanomaterials can serve as probing agents for accessing newer information from microbial organisms due to their dimensional similarities. In this article, a bionic mushroom was created by intertwining cyanobacterial cells with graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) onto the umbrella-shaped pileus of mushroom for photosynthetic bioelectricity generation. These seamlessly merged GNRs function as agents for mediating extracellular electron transport from cyanobacteria resulting in photocurrent generation. Additionally, three-dimensional (3D) printing technique was used to assemble cyanobacterial cells in anisotropic, densely packed geometry resulting in adequate cell-population density for efficient collective behavior. These 3D printed cyanobacterial colonies resulted in comparatively higher photocurrent (almost 8-fold increase) than isotropically casted cyanobacteria of similar seeding density. An insight of the proposed integration between cyanobacteria and mushroom derives remarkable advantage that arises from symbiotic relationship, termed here as engineered bionic symbiosis. Existence of this engineered bionic symbiosis was confirmed by UV-visible spectroscopy and standard plate counting method. Taken together, the present study augments scientific understanding of multidimensional integration between the living biological microworld and functional abiotic nanomaterials to establish newer dimensionalities toward advancement of bacterial nanobionics.","['1 Neuro-Bionics and Neuro-Electric Medicine Laboratory, Department of Mechanical Engineering , Stevens Institute of Technology , Hoboken , New Jersey 07030 , United States.']","Sudeep Joshi, Ellexis Cook, Manu S Mannoor, ",Nano letters,2018,Additive manufacturing; bionic symbiosis; cyanobacteria; graphene nanoribbons; mushroom; photosynthetic bioelectricity.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30403141
468,Proton Therapy Delivery and Its Clinical Application in Select Solid Tumor Malignancies,"Radiation therapy is a frequently used modality for the treatment of solid cancers. Although the mechanisms of cell kill are similar for all forms of radiation, the in vivo properties of photon and proton beams differ greatly and maybe exploited to optimize clinical outcomes. In particular, proton particles lose energy in a predictable manner as they pass through the body. This property is used clinically to control the depth at which the proton beam is terminated, and to limit radiation dose beyond the target region. This strategy can allow for substantial reductions in radiation dose to normal tissues located just beyond a tumor target. However, the degradation of proton energy in the body remains highly sensitive to tissue density. As a consequence, any changes in tissue density during the course of treatment may significantly alter proton dosimetry. Such changes may occur through alterations in body weight, respiration, or bowel filling/gas, and may result in unfavorable dose deposition. In this manuscript, we provide a detailed method for the delivery of proton therapy using both passive scatter and pencil beam scanning techniques for prostate cancer. Although the described procedure directly pertains to prostate cancer patients, the method may be adapted and applied for the treatment of virtually all solid tumors. Our aim is to equip readers with a better understanding of proton therapy delivery and outcomes in order to facilitate the appropriate integration of this modality during cancer therapy.","['1 Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Maryland School of Medicine; akaiser@som.umaryland.edu.', '2 Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Maryland School of Medicine.', '3 Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Maryland Medical Center.', '4 Department of Medicine, University of Maryland School of Medicine, University of Maryland Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center.']","Adeel Kaiser, John G Eley, Nasarachi E Onyeuku, Stephanie R Rice, Carleen C Wright, Nathan E McGovern, Megan Sank, Mingyao Zhu, Zeljko Vujaskovic, Charles B Simone 2nd, Arif Hussain, ",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30799838

470,"Nanoscale, tunable, and highly sensitive biosensor utilizing hyperbolic metamaterials in the near-infrared range","A plethora of research in recent years has been reported on biosensing in the surface plasmon resonant systems. However, very little research has reported a tunable and highly sensitive biosensor in a nanoscale platform. In this regard, we propose a nanoscale hyperbolic metamaterial (HMM)-based prism coupled waveguide sensor (PCWS) in the near-infrared range. The HMM layer makes up one of the constituents of the PCWS-comprised of a periodically arranged assembly of silver nanostrips. The structure is numerically simulated by the finite difference time domain method. It is demonstrated that the sensitivity of the reflected light can be tuned through the refractive index (RI) of the solution. Moreover, the effects of alteration of constituents of PCWS on the sensitivity have been analyzed. Results show that the sensitivity of PCWS can be harnessed by altering the thickness, slant angle of HMM layer, volume fraction (f) of metal in the HMM layer, and the incidence angle of light. For this purpose, the structure is numerically simulated by the finite difference time domain method. In the optimum design of the proposed sensor, the maximum value of sensitivity is achieved as high as S=3450 nm/refractive index unit with θ=10° and ϕ=10° and a metamaterial thickness of 250 nm.

471,Proton versus photon-based radiation therapy for prostate cancer: emerging evidence and considerations in the era of value-based cancer care,"Background:
      
    

    
      Advances in radiation technology have transformed treatment options for patients with localized prostate cancer. The evolution of three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) have allowed physicians to spare surrounding normal organs and reduce adverse effects. The introduction of proton beam technology and its physical advantage of depositing its energy in tissue at the end-of-range maximum may potentially spare critical organs such as the bladder and rectum in prostate cancer patients. Data thus far are limited to large, observational studies that have not yet demonstrated a definite benefit of protons over conventional treatment with IMRT. The cost of proton beam treatment adds to the controversy within the field. Methods:
      
    

    
      We performed an extensive literature review for all proton treatment-related prostate cancer studies. We discuss the history of proton beam technology, as well as its role in the treatment of prostate cancer, associated controversies, novel technology trends, a discussion of cost-effectiveness, and an overview of the ongoing modern large prospective studies that aim to resolve the debate between protons and photons for prostate cancer. Results:
      
    

    
      Present data have demonstrated that proton beam therapy is safe and effective compared with the standard treatment options for prostate cancer. While dosimetric studies suggest lower whole-body radiation dose and a theoretically higher relative biological effectiveness in prostate cancer compared with photons, no studies have demonstrated a clear benefit with protons. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Evolving trends in proton treatment delivery and proton center business models are helping to reduce costs. Introduction of existing technology into proton delivery allows further control of organ motion and addressing organs-at-risk. Finally, the much-awaited contemporary studies comparing photon with proton-based treatments, with primary endpoints of patient-reported quality-of-life, will help us understand the differences between proton and photon-based treatments for prostate cancer in the modern era.","['1 Department of Radiation Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA. skamran@partners.org.', '2 Harvard Business School, Boston, MA, USA.', '3 Department of Radiation Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']","Sophia C Kamran, Jay O Light, Jason A Efstathiou, ",Prostate cancer and prostatic diseases,2019 Dec,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30967625
472,Assessing molecular interactions with biophysical methods using the validation cross,"There are numerous methods for studying molecular interactions. However, each method gives rise to false negative- or false positive binding results, stemming from artifacts of the scientific equipment or from shortcomings of the experimental format. To validate an initial positive binding result, additional methods need to be applied to cover the shortcomings of the primary experiment. The aim of such a validation procedure is to exclude as many artifacts as possible to confirm that there is a true molecular interaction that meets the standards for publishing or is worth investing considerable resources for follow-up activities in a drug discovery project. To simplify this validation process, a graphical scheme - the validation cross - can be used. This simple graphic is a powerful tool for identifying blind spots of a binding hypothesis, for selecting the most informative combination of methods to reveal artifacts and, in general, for understanding more thoroughly the nature of a validation process. The concept of the validation cross was originally introduced for the validation of protein-ligand interactions by NMR in drug discovery. Here, an attempt is made to expand the concept to further biophysical methods and to generalize it for binary molecular interactions.","['1 Institute of Molecular Biology and Biophysics, ETH Zürich, 8093 Zürich, Switzerland alvar.gossert@mol.biol.ethz.ch.', '2 Biomolecular NMR Spectroscopy Platform, ETH Zürich, 8093 Zürich, Switzerland.']","Alvar D Gossert, ",Biochemical Society transactions,2019,NMR; biophysics; drug discovery; molecular interactions; screening; validation.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30578343
473,Influence of a transverse magnetic field on the response of different detectors in a high energy photon beam near the surface,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      The characteristics of radiation detectors have to be assessed for dosimetry in the presence of magnetic fields, i.e. in conditions found in combined machines for magnetic resonance imaging and radiotherapy. While a lot of attention is directed toward correction factors for absolute dosimetry in magnetic fields, relative dose measurements are an equally important task to be performed. There is a need to experimentally analyze detector response differences in the build-up region in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. Methods:
      
    

    
      Depth dose curves with different detectors (microDiamond PTW 60019, unshielded diode PTW 60012, ionization chamber PTW Semiflex 31010 and EBT3 film) were acquired for a beam quality of 6MV in an 8×10cm2 field at SSD 110cm with and without a transverse magnetic field of up to 1.1T. For these experiments, an electromagnet was placed in front of a conventional linear accelerator of the type Elekta Precise. The detectors were positioned in a water phantom fitting between the poles of the electromagnet. The beam entered through a 0.3mm thin PMMA foil window, which enabled measurements even close to the surface. Ratios of the response with and without the magnetic field for different detectors were investigated. The film served as a reference. Results:
      
    

    
      Changes in the depth dose curve near the surface due to the magnetic field were not correctly reproduced by all detectors. EBT3 film and the microDiamond detector agreed up to the surface. The diode showed up to 2% deviation from the film in the build-up region, but it could still be considered within the uncertainties. However, the curves obtained with the ionization chamber showed up to 6% deviation from the film and even completely different trends in the surface-near region. At depths larger than 2cm, there were no noticeable differences between the different detectors for relative depth dose curves. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      At the descending part of the depth dose, the tested detectors did not show artifacts within the magnetic field. However, air-filled ionization chambers cannot be recommended for relative dosimetry in magnetic fields near the surface. Diamond detectors might be a suitable alternative and future investigations should concentrate on the performance of such detectors.","['1 Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Würzburg, Josef-Schneider-Str. 11, 97080 Würzburg, Germany.

474,Applying a variable relative biological effectiveness (RBE) might affect the analysis of clinical trials comparing photon and proton therapy for prostate cancer,"The purpose of this study was the evaluation of the impact of a variable relative biological effectiveness (RBE) compared to a constant RBE value of 1.1 in proton therapy prostate trials due to uncertainties in α/β ratio. Twenty patients receiving passive scattered proton therapy (PSPT) and fifteen patients receiving intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) were compared to twenty patients treated with 7-field intensity modulated photon therapy (IMRT). For proton beam therapy (PBT), the RBE was estimated using two different RBE models. Tumor control probabilities (TCP) and normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCP) were assessed. For one of the RBE models, dosimetric indices assuming a low α/β were ~10%-11% larger compared to using a fixed RBE. A different model resulted in 1%-3% lower values independent of α/β. Comparing PBT with IMRT revealed a negligible difference in TCP for a fixed RBE. Applying a variable RBE revealed an increase in TCP by 6% for PBT compared to IMRT for one model but a decrease of 2% for the other. Variable RBE values in PSPT resulted in an increase in NTCP for rectum from 7% to 11% for a fixed RBE with one model but a decrease to 6% for another. For IMPT, NTCP increased from 5% to 9% for a fixed RBE for one model but decreased to 3% using the other. The NTCP for bladder increased for PSPT for both models, from 11% to 19% and 14%, respectively. For IMPT, the NTCP increased from 12% to 17% using one model but decreased to 11% with the other. In radiation therapy for prostate cancer, disregarding variable RBE may lead to either underestimation or overestimation of the expected TCP and NTCP, depending on the RBE model and α/β. This should be considered when estimating uncertainties when comparing PBT and IMRT outcomes in clinical trials.","['1 Department of Radiation Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, United States of America.

Taking inspiration from the design principles of nature allows engineering more efficient and compatible biomaterials. Indeed, bionic (from bion-, unit of life and -ic, like) materials have gained increasing attention in the last decades due to their ability to mimic some of the characteristics of nature systems, such as dynamism, selectivity, or signalling. However, there are still many challenges when it comes to their interaction with the human body, which hinder their further clinical development. Here we review some of the recent progress in the field of molecular bionics with the final aim of providing with design rules to ensure their stability in biological media as well as to engineer novel functionalities which enable navigating the human body.","['1 Department of Chemistry, University College London (UCL) 20 Gordon St, Kings Cross, London, WC1H 0AJ, UK; Institute for Physics of Living Systems, University College London, London, UK.

476,Bridging biophysics and neurology: aberrant phase transitions in neurodegenerative disease,"Biomolecular condensation arising through phase transitions has emerged as an essential organizational strategy that governs many aspects of cell biology. In particular, the role of phase transitions in the assembly of large, complex ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules has become appreciated as an important regulator of RNA metabolism. In parallel, genetic, histopathological and cell and molecular studies have provided evidence that disturbance of phase transitions is an important driver of neurological diseases, notably amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but most likely also other diseases. Indeed, our growing knowledge of the biophysics underlying biological phase transitions suggests that this process offers a unifying mechanism to explain the numerous and diverse disturbances in RNA metabolism that have been observed in ALS and some related diseases - specifically, that these diseases are driven by disturbances in the material properties of RNP granules. Here, we review the evidence for this hypothesis, emphasizing the reciprocal roles in which disease-related protein and disease-related RNA can lead to disturbances in the material properties of RNP granules and consequent pathogenesis. Additionally, we review evidence that implicates aberrant phase transitions as a contributing factor to a larger set of neurodegenerative diseases, including frontotemporal dementia, certain repeat expansion diseases and Alzheimer disease.","[""1 Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""2 Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA. jpaul.taylor@stjude.org."", '3 Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Chevy Chase, MD, USA. jpaul.taylor@stjude.org.']","Natalia B Nedelsky, J Paul Taylor, ",Nature reviews.

Six left sided breast cancer patients were CT-simulated in S and P positions and four patients only in P position. Treatment plans were made using non-coplanar volumetric modulated arc photon therapy (VMAT) or pencil beam scanning intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT). Dose prescription was 15*2.67 Gy(GyRBE). The average mean heart doses for S or P VMAT were 5.6 or 4.3 Gy, respectively (p = 0.16) and 1.02 or 1.08 GyRBE, respectively for IMPT (p = 0.8; p < 0.001 for IMPT versus VMAT). The average mean lung doses for S or P VMAT were 5.91 or 2.90 Gy, respectively (p = 0.002) and 1.56 or 1.09 GyRBE, respectively for IMPT (p = 0.016). In high-risk patients, average (range) thirty-year mortality rates from radiotherapy-related cardiac injury and lung cancer were estimated at 6.8(5.4-9.4)% or 3.8(2.8-5.1)% for S or P VMAT (p < 0.001), respectively, and 1.6(1.1-2.0)% or 1.2(0.8-1.6)% for S or P IMPT (p = 0.25), respectively. Radiation-related mortality risk could outweigh the ~8% disease-specific survival benefit of WB + LN_IM radiotherapy for S VMAT but not P VMAT. IMPT carries the lowest radiation-related mortality risks.","['1 Department of Radiotherapy and Experimental Cancer Research, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', '2 Paul Scherrer Institut, Villigen, Switzerland.', '3 Department of Radiation Oncology, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', '4 Industrial Design Center, Faculty of Engineering and Architecture, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', '5 Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', '6 Radiation Oncology Department, University Hospital of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', '7 Department of Radiotherapy and Experimental Cancer Research, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium. wilfried.deneve@ugent.be.', '8 Department of Radiation Oncology, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium. wilfried.deneve@ugent.be.']","Bruno A Speleers, Francesca M Belosi, Werner R De Gersem, Pieter R Deseyne, Leen M Paelinck, Alessandra Bolsi, Antony J Lomax, Bert G Boute, Annick E Van Greveling, Christel M Monten, Joris J Van de Velde, Tom H Vercauteren, Liv Veldeman, Damien C Weber, Wilfried C De Neve, ",Scientific reports,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30894606

479,Imaging Cortical Dynamics in GCaMP Transgenic Rats with a Head-Mounted Widefield Macroscope,"Widefield imaging of calcium dynamics is an emerging method for mapping regional neural activity but is currently limited to restrained animals. Here we describe cScope, a head-mounted widefield macroscope developed to image large-scale cortical dynamics in rats during natural behavior. cScope provides a 7.8 × 4 mm field of view and dual illumination paths for both fluorescence and hemodynamic correction and can be fabricated at low cost using readily attainable components. We also report the development of Thy-1 transgenic rat strains with widespread neuronal expression of the calcium indicator GCaMP6f. We combined these two technologies to image large-scale calcium dynamics in the dorsal neocortex during a visual evidence accumulation task. Quantitative analysis of task-related dynamics revealed multiple regions having neural signals that encode behavioral choice and sensory evidence. Our results provide a new transgenic resource for calcium imaging in rats and extend the domain of head-mounted microscopes to larger-scale cortical dynamics.

480,"Multi-threading performance of Geant4, MCNP6, and PHITS Monte Carlo codes for tetrahedral-mesh geometry","In this study, the multi-threading performance of the Geant4, MCNP6, and PHITS codes was evaluated as a function of the number of threads (N) and the complexity of the tetrahedral-mesh phantom. For this, three tetrahedral-mesh phantoms of varying complexity (simple, moderately complex, and highly complex) were prepared and implemented in the three different Monte Carlo codes, in photon and neutron transport simulations. Subsequently, for each case, the initialization time, calculation time, and memory usage were measured as a function of the number of threads used in the simulation. It was found that for all codes, the initialization time significantly increased with the complexity of the phantom, but not with the number of threads. Geant4 exhibited much longer initialization time than the other codes, especially for the complex phantom (MRCP). The improvement of computation speed due to the use of a multi-threaded code was calculated as the speed-up factor, the ratio of the computation speed on a multi-threaded code to the computation speed on a single-threaded code. Geant4 showed the best multi-threading performance among the codes considered in this study, with the speed-up factor almost linearly increasing with the number of threads, reaching ~30 when N = 40. PHITS and MCNP6 showed a much smaller increase of the speed-up factor with the number of threads. For PHITS, the speed-up factors were low when N = 40. For MCNP6, the increase of the speed-up factors was better, but they were still less than ~10 when N = 40. As for memory usage, Geant4 was found to use more memory than the other codes. In addition, compared to that of the other codes, the memory usage of Geant4 more rapidly increased with the number of threads, reaching as high as ~74 GB when N = 40 for the complex phantom (MRCP). It is notable that compared to that of the other codes, the memory usage of PHITS was much lower, regardless of both the complexity of the phantom and the number of threads, hardly increasing with the number of threads for the MRCP.","['1 INFN Sezione di Genova, Via Dodecaneso 33, Genova 16146, Italy.

481,Learning from clinical phenotypes: Low-dose biophotonics therapies in oral diseases,"This narrative review on the use of biophotonics therapies for management of oral diseases is written as a tribute to Prof. Crispian Scully. His seminal contributions to the field are highlighted by the detailed, comprehensive description of clinical presentations of oral diseases. This has enabled a more thorough, fundamental understanding of many of these pathologies by research from his group as well as inspired mechanistic investigations in many groups globally. In the same vein, a major emphasis of this narrative review is to focus on the evidence from human case reports rather than in vitro or in vivo animal studies that showcases the growing and broad impact of biophotonics therapies. The similarities and differences between two distinct forms of low-dose biophotonics treatments namely photodynamic therapy and photobiomodulation therapy are discussed. As evident in this review, a majority of these reports provide promising evidence for their clinical efficacy. However, a lack of adequate technical details, precise biological rationale, and limited outcome measures limits the current utility of these treatments. Future investigations should attempt to address these shortcomings and develop better designed, rigorous, controlled studies to fully harness the tremendous potential of low-dose biophotonics therapies.","['1 Oral Biology, School of Dental Medicine, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA.', '2 Energetic and Nuclear Research Institute, Radiation Technology Center, São Paulo, Brazil.', '3 Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering, Universidade Brasil, São Paulo, Brazil.', '4 Restorative and Implant Dentistry, School of Dental Medicine, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA.', '5 Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, School of Dental Medicine, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA.']","S U Rahman, R C Mosca, S Govindool Reddy, S C Nunez, S Andreana, T S Mang, P R Arany, ",Oral diseases,2018 Mar,anti-microbial; inflammation; low level light/laser therapy; oral diseases; photobiomodulation therapy; photodynamic therapy; wound healing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29480614

The present work is focused on studying the unwanted generated photoneutrons in a Medical Linear Accelerator (LinAc) Varian TrueBeam using a 6 MeV radiation treatment beam. To that, Monte Carlo (MC) simulation code MCNP6.1.1 was used. This version of the code allows the use of unstructured mesh geometries as a novelty, offering more reliable results and higher speed computation. The particularity of the studied LinAc is the presence of a beryllium filter at the treatment head. Since Beryllium causes photonuclear reactions (γ, n) at energies much lower than other LinAc composing materials, this work aims to analyze if this type of units, when using low energy treatment beams (6 MeV), produce neutron pollution and to ensure that this unwanted radiation can be considered negligible.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"B Juste, S Morato, A Salvat, R Miro, G Verdu, ",Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

485,Cell membrane biophysics with optical tweezers,"Membrane elastic properties play important roles in regulating cell shape, motility, division and differentiation. Here I review optical tweezer (OT) investigations of membrane surface tension and bending modulus, emphasizing didactic aspects and insights provided for cell biology. OT measurements employ membrane-attached microspheres to extract long cylindrical nanotubes named tethers. The Helfrich-Canham theory yields elastic parameters in terms of tether radius and equilibrium extraction force. It assumes initial point-like microsphere attachment and no cytoskeleton content within tethers. Experimental force-displacement curves reveal violations of those assumptions, and I discuss proposed explanations of such discrepancies, as well as recommended OT protocols. Measurements of elastic parameters for predominant cell types in the central nervous system yield correlations between their values and cell function. Micro-rheology OT experiments extend these correlations to viscoelastic parameters. The results agree with a quasi-universal phenomenological scaling law and are interpreted in terms of the soft glass rheology model. Spontaneously-generated cell nanotube protrusions are also briefly reviewed, emphasizing common features with tethers. Filopodia as well as tunneling nanotubes (TNT), which connect distant cells and allow transfers between their cytoplasms, are discussed, including OT tether pulling from TNTs which mediate communication among bacteria, even of different species. Pathogens, including bacteria, viruses and prions, opportunistically exploit TNTs for cell-to-cell transmission of infection, indicating that TNTs have an ancient evolutionary origin.","['1 LPO-COPEA, Instituto de Ciências Biomédicas, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, 21941-902, Brazil. hmoyses@globo.com.', '2 Instituto de Física, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, 21941-972, Brazil. hmoyses@globo.com.']","H Moysés Nussenzveig, ",European biophysics journal : EBJ,2018 Jul,Cell membrane nanotubes; Elastic properties; Optical tweezers.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29164289
486,Asymptomatic Late-phase Radiographic Changes Among Chest-Wall Patients Are Associated With a Proton RBE Exceeding 1.1,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      Clinical practice assumes a fixed proton relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of 1.1, but in vitro experiments demonstrate higher RBEs at the distal edge of the proton spread-out Bragg peak, that is, in a region that falls within the lung for chest-wall patients. We performed retrospective qualitative and quantitative analyses of lung-density changes-indicative of asymptomatic fibrosis-for chest-wall patients treated with protons or photons. Our null hypothesis was that, assuming a fixed RBE of 1.1, these changes would be the same for the 2 cohorts, supporting current RBE practice. Our alternative hypothesis was that radiographic abnormalities would be greater for the proton cohort, suggesting an RBE > 1.1. Methods and materials:
      
    

    
      We analyzed follow-up computed tomography (CT) scans for 20 proton and photon patients. All were prescribed 50.4 Gy (RBE) in 28 fractions, assuming a fixed RBE of 1.1 for protons and 1 for photons. Deformable registrations enabled us to calculate density changes in the normal lung, specifically (1) median Hounsfield unit (HU) values among posttreatment CT scans and (2) changes in median HU values between pretreatment and posttreatment CT scans, both as a function of grays (RBE). In addition, qualitative abnormality grading was performed by a radiologist. Results:
      
    

    
      Proton patients exhibited higher values of HU/Gy (RBE) (endpoint 1) and ΔHU/Gy (RBE) (endpoint 2): P = .049 and P = .00019, respectively, were obtained (likelihood ratio tests of full linear mixed-effects models against models without ""modality""). Furthermore, qualitative radiologic scoring indicated a significant difference between the cohorts (Wilcoxon P = .018; median score, 3 of 9 for protons and 1.5 of 9 for photons). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our data support the hypothesis that the proton RBE for lung-density changes exceeds 1.1. This RBE elevation could be attributable to (1) the late, normal tissue endpoint that we consider or (2) end-of-range proton linear energy transfer elevation-or a combination of the two. Regardless, our results suggest that variations in proton RBE prove important in vivo as well as in vitro.","['1 Department of Radiation Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts; Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London, London, UK.

487,Electrophysiological measurements of diabetic peripheral neuropathy: A systematic review,"Introduction:
      
    

    
      Peripheral neuropathy is one of the main complications of diabetes mellitus. One of the features of diabetic nerve damage is abnormality of sensory and motor nerve conduction study. An electrophysiological examination can be reproduced and is also a non-invasive approach in the assessment of peripheral nerve function. Population-based and clinical studies have been conducted to validate the sensitivity of these methods. When the diagnosis was based on clinical electrophysiological examination, abnormalities were observed in all patients. Method:
      
    

    
      In this research, using a review design, we reviewed the issue of clinical electrophysiological examination of diabetic peripheral neuropathy in articles from 2008 to 2017. For this purpose, PubMed, Scopus and Embase databases of journals were used for searching articles. Results/findings:
      
    

    
      The researchers indicated that diabetes (both types) is a very disturbing health issue in the modern world and should be given serious attention. Based on conducted studies, it was demonstrated that there are different procedures for prevention and treatment of diabetes-related health problems such as diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN). The first objective quantitative indication of the peripheral neuropathy is abnormality of sensory and motor nerve conduction tests. Electrophysiology is accurate, reliable and sensitive. It can be reproduced and also is a noninvasive approach in the assessment of peripheral nerve function. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The methodological review has found that the best method for quantitative indication of the peripheral neuropathy compared with all other methods is clinical electrophysiological examination. For best results, standard protocols such as temperature control and equipment calibration are recommended.","['1 Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Science, International Campus, Tehran, Iran; Department of Physiology, College of Medicine, University of Misan, Iraq; Electrophysiology Research Center, Neuroscience Institute, Tehran University of Medical Science, Tehran, Iran.', '2 Radiology and Nuclear Medicine Department, School of Paramedical Sciences, Kermanshah University of Medical Science, Kermanshah, Iran.', '3 Department of Anatomy, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Science, Tehran, Iran.', '4 Brain and Spinal Injury Repair Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Science, Tehran, Iran.', '5 Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Science, International Campus, Tehran, Iran; Research Center for Molecular and Cellular Imaging, Tehran University of Medical Science, Tehran, Iran.', '6 Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Science, International Campus, Tehran, Iran; Electrophysiology Research Center, Neuroscience Institute, Tehran University of Medical Science, Tehran, Iran.

488,Scanless two-photon excitation with temporal focusing,"Temporal focusing, with its ability to focus light in time, enables scanless illumination of large surface areas at the sample with micrometer axial confinement and robust propagation through scattering tissue. In conventional two-photon microscopy, widely used for the investigation of intact tissue in live animals, images are formed by point scanning of a spatially focused pulsed laser beam, resulting in limited temporal resolution of the excitation. Replacing point scanning with temporally focused widefield illumination removes this limitation and represents an important milestone in two-photon microscopy. Temporal focusing uses a diffusive or dispersive optical element placed in a plane conjugate to the objective focal plane to generate position-dependent temporal pulse broadening that enables axially confined multiphoton absorption, without the need for tight spatial focusing. Many techniques have benefitted from temporal focusing, including scanless imaging, super-resolution imaging, photolithography, uncaging of caged neurotransmitters and control of neuronal activity via optogenetics.","['1 Wavefront-Engineering Microscopy Group, Photonics Department, Institut de la Vision, Sorbonne University, Inserm S968, CNRS UMR7210, Fondation Voir et Entendre, Paris, France.', '2 Wavefront-Engineering Microscopy Group, Photonics Department, Institut de la Vision, Sorbonne University, Inserm S968, CNRS UMR7210, Fondation Voir et Entendre, Paris, France. valentina.emiliani@inserm.fr.']","Eirini Papagiakoumou, Emiliano Ronzitti, Valentina Emiliani, ",Nature methods,2020 Jun,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32284609
489,DOSIMETRY WITH SALT IN MIXED RADIATION FIELDS OF PHOTONS AND NEUTRONS,"Salt (NaCl) represents a radiation sensitive material with a considerable potential for dosimetry in mixed radiation fields of photons and neutrons. In consequence of a gamma radiation exposure, it exhibits a strong luminescence signal following stimulation with blue light. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) technique can be used for measurement. Photon dose reconstruction can be done using so-called Single-Aliquot Regenerative-dose protocol. However, a part of OSL signal is caused by NaCl self-irradiation resulting from neutron reactions. This NaCl neutron sensitivity is comparable with neutron sensitivity of TLD-700. Neutron dose can be determined based on neutron activation of NaCl via reaction 23Na(n,γ)24Na. A relation between neutron dose and activity of 24Na can be derived. The total dose is thus determined based on the combination of results of OSL measurements and gamma activity measurements. Practical feasibility of this approach was experimentally verified for salt samples irradiated in a channel of a training reactor.","['1 National Radiation Protection Institute, Bartoškova 1450/28, CZ-140 00 Prague 4, Czech Republic.', '2 Czech Technical University in Prague, Faculty of Nuclear Sciences and Physical Engineering, V Holešovickách 2, CZ-180 00 Prague 8, Czech Republic.']","Daniela Ekendahl, Peter Rubovic, Pavel Žlebcík, Ondrej Huml, Helena Malá, ",Radiation protection dosimetry,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28981792
490,Microneurography: how it started and how it works,"In the first section, this historical review describes endeavors to develop the method for recording normal nerve impulse traffic in humans, designated microneurography. The method was developed at the Department of Clinical Neurophysiology of the Academic Hospital in Uppsala, Sweden. Microneurography involves the impalement of a peripheral nerve with a tungsten needle electrode. Electrode position is adjusted by hand until the activity of interest is discriminated. Nothing similar had previously been tried in animal preparations, and thus the large number of preceding studies that recorded afferent activity in other mammals did not offer pertinent methodological guidance. For 2 years, the two scientists involved in the research impaled their own nerves with electrodes to test various kinds of needles and explore different neural systems, all the while carefully watching for signs of nerve damage. Temporary paresthesiae were common, whereas enduring sequelae never followed. Single-unit impulse trains could be discriminated, even those originating from unmyelinated fibers. An explanation for the discrimination of unitary impulses using a coarse electrode is inferred based on the electrical characteristics of the electrode placed in the flesh and the impulse shapes, as discussed in the second section of this paper. Microneurography and the microstimulation of single afferents, combined with psychophysical methods and behavioral tests, have generated new knowledge particularly regarding four neural systems, namely the proprioceptive system, the cutaneous mechanoreceptive system, the cutaneous nociceptive system, and the sympathetic efferent system to skin structures and muscular blood vessels. Examples of achievements based on microneurography are presented in the final section.","['1 Department of Physiology, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, University of Gothenburg , Gothenburg , Sweden.']","Åke Bernhard Vallbo, ",Journal of neurophysiology,2018,afferent impulses; human; microneurography; peripheral nerves; sensory mechanisms.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29924706

We have also compared VINO and EnChroma glasses. The spectral transmission of the VINO glasses significantly changed color appearance. This change would allow some CVD subjects, above all the deutan ones, to be able to pass recognition tests but not the arrangement tests. To sum up, our results support the hypothesis that glasses with filters are unable to effectively resolve the problems related to color vision deficiency.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Miguel A Martínez-Domingo, Luis Gómez-Robledo, Eva M Valero, Rafael Huertas, Javier Hernández-Andrés, Silvia Ezpeleta, Enrique Hita, ",Optics express,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31252746
492,Modeling scattered radiation from multi-leaf collimators (MLCs) to improve calculation accuracy of in-air output ratio,"This study aims to model an extra-focal source for the scattered radiation from multi-leaf collimators (MLCs), namely an MLC scatter source, and to correct in-air output ratio (Sc) calculated using the conventional dual source model (DSM) to achieve better accuracy of point dose calculation. To develop the MLC scatter source, a 6 MV photon beam from a Varian Clinac® iX linear accelerator with millennium 120 MLCs was used. It was assumed that the position for the MLC scatter source was located at the center of the MLC, consisting of line-based and area-based sources to consider the characteristics of the scattered radiation from the MLCs empirically. Based on the measured Sc values for MLC-defined fields, optimal parameters for the line-based and area-based sources were calculated using optimization process. For evaluation of proposed method, measurements were taken for various MLC-defined square and irregular fields. The Sc values calculated using the proposed MLC scatter source and conventional DSM were compared with the measured data. For MLC-defined square fields, the measured Sc values showed better agreement with those calculated using the MLC scatter source (the mean difference was - 0.03%) compared with those calculated using the DSM (the mean difference was 0.18%). For MLC-defined irregular fields, the maximum dose differences between measurements and calculations using the MLC scatter source and DSM were 0.54% and 1.45%, respectively. The developed MLC scatter source could improve the accuracy of Sc calculation for both square and irregular fields defined by MLCs.","['1 Institute of Radiation Medicine, Seoul National University Medical Research Center, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', '2 Department of Radiation Oncology, Veterans Health Service Medical Center, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', '3 Department of Radiation Oncology, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA.', '4 Department of Radiation Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', '5 Radiation Protection and Emergency Preparedness Bureau, Nuclear Safety and Security Commission, Seoul, Republic of Korea. st.kim7@daum.net.']","So-Yeon Park, Siyong Kim, Wonmo Sung, Sang-Tae Kim, ",Australasian physical & engineering sciences in medicine,2019 Sep,In-air output ratio; Intensity modulated radiation therapy; Multi-leaf collimator; Source model; Volumetric modulated arc therapy.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31332725

Nocturnal mosquitoes exhibit a behavioral response to divert away from surfaces when vision is unavailable, indicating a short-range, mechanosensory collision-avoidance mechanism. We suggest that this behavior is mediated by perceiving modulations of their self-induced airflow patterns as they enter a ground or wall effect. We used computational fluid dynamics simulations of low-altitude and near-wall flights based on in vivo high-speed kinematic measurements to quantify changes in the self-generated pressure and velocity cues at the sensitive mechanosensory antennae. We validated the principle that encoding aerodynamic information can enable collision avoidance by developing a quadcopter with a sensory system inspired by the mosquito. Such low-power sensing systems have major potential for future use in safer rotorcraft control systems.","['1 Structure and Motion Laboratory, Royal Veterinary College, Hatfield AL9 7TA, UK.', '2 Graduate School of Engineering, Chiba University, Chiba 263-8522, Japan.', '3 Pharmacy and Biomolecular Sciences, University of Brighton, Moulsecoomb, Brighton BN2 4GJ, UK.', '4 Faculty of Biological Sciences, University of Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, UK.', '5 Structure and Motion Laboratory, Royal Veterinary College, Hatfield AL9 7TA, UK. rbomphrey@rvc.ac.uk.']","Toshiyuki Nakata, Nathan Phillips, Patrício Simões, Ian J Russell, Jorn A Cheney, Simon M Walker, Richard J Bomphrey, ","Science (New York, N.Y.)",2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32381721

498,Simulation of dose distribution in bone medium of 125 I photon emitting source with Monte Carlo method,"Objective:
      
    

    
      To present a theoretical analysis of how the presence of bone in interstitial brachytherapy affects dose rate distributions with MCNP4C Monte Carlo code and to prepare for the next clinical study on the dose distribution of interstitial brachytherapy in head and neck neoplasm. Methods:
      
    

    
      Type 6711,125I brachytherapy source was simulated with MCNP4C Monte Carlo code whose cross section library was DLC-200. The dose distribution along the transverse axis in water and dose constant were compared with the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) TG43UI update dosimetry formalism and current literature. The validated computer code was then applied to simple homogeneous bone tissue model to determine the affected different bone tissue had on dose distribution from 125I interstitial implant. Results:
      
125I brachytherapy source simulated with MCNP4C Monte Carlo code met the requirements of TG43UI report. Dose rate constant, 0.977 78 cGy/(h×U), was in agreement within 1.32% compared with the recommended value of TG43UI. There was a good agreement between TG43UI about the dosimetric parameters at distances of 1 to 10 cm along the transverse axis of the 125I source established by MCNP4C and current published data. And the dose distribution of 125I photon emitting source in different bone tissue was calculated. Dose-deposition capacity of photons was in decreasing order: cortical bone, spongy bone, cartilage, yellow bone marrow, red bone marrow in the same medium depth. Photons deposited significantly in traversal axis among the phantom material of cortical bone and sponge bone relevant to the dose to water. In the medium depth of 0.01 cm, 0.1 cm, and 1 cm, the dose in the cortical bone was 12.90 times, 9.72 times, and 0.30 times of water respectively. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      This study build a 125I source model with MCNP4C Monte Carlo code, which is validated, and could be used in subsequent study. Dose distribution of photons in different bone medium is not the same as water, and its main energy deposits in bone medium surface, so we should consider the effect of bone medium when we design the target area adjacent to the bone tissue in 125I sources implantation plan.","['1 Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology & National Engineering Laboratory for Digital and Material Technology of Stomatology & Beijing Key Laboratory of Digital Stomatology, Beijing 100081, China.', '2 Department of Engineering Physics, Tsinghua University, Key Laboratory of Particle and Radiation Imaging, Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of High Energy Radiation Imaging Fundamental Science,Beijing 100084, China.']","K Q Ye, M W Huang, J L Li, J T Tang, J G Zhang, ",Beijing da xue xue bao.

We present an optical approach, distance-encoding photoinduced electron transfer (DEPET), capable of the simultaneous study of protein structure and function. An alternative to FRET-based methods, DEPET is based on the quenching of small conjugated fluorophores by photoinduced electron transfer: a reaction that requires contact of the excited fluorophore with a suitable electron donor. This property allows DEPET to exhibit exceptional spatial and temporal resolution capabilities in the range pertinent to protein conformational change. We report the first implementation of DEPET on human large-conductance K+ (BK) channels under voltage clamp. We describe conformational rearrangements underpinning BK channel sensitivity to electrical excitation, in conducting channels expressed in living cells. Finally, we validate DEPET in synthetic peptide length standards, to evaluate its accuracy in measuring sub- and near-nanometer intramolecular distances.","['1 Division of Molecular Medicine, Department of Anesthesiology & Perioperative Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, 90095, USA. antonios.pantazis@liu.se.', '2 Division of Neurobiology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine (IKE), Linköping University, Linköping, 581 83, Sweden. antonios.pantazis@liu.se.', '3 Wallenberg Center for Molecular Medicine, Linköping University, Linköping, 581 83, Sweden. antonios.pantazis@liu.se.', '4 Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA, 91320, USA.', '5 Department of Physiology, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, 90095, USA.', '6 Division of Molecular Medicine, Department of Anesthesiology & Perioperative Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, 90095, USA. rolcese@ucla.edu.', '7 Department of Physiology, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, 90095, USA. rolcese@ucla.edu.']","Antonios Pantazis, Karin Westerberg, Thorsten Althoff, Jeff Abramson, Riccardo Olcese, ",Nature communications,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30413716
501,SparseCT: System concept and design of multislit collimators,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      SparseCT, an undersampling scheme for compressed sensing (CS) computed tomography (CT), has been proposed to reduce radiation dose by acquiring undersampled projection data from clinical CT scanners (Koesters et al. in, SparseCT: Interrupted-Beam Acquisition and Sparse Reconstruction for Radiation Dose Reduction; 2017). SparseCT partially blocks the x-ray beam with a multislit collimator (MSC) to perform a multidimensional undersampling along the view and detector row dimensions. SparseCT undersamples the projection data within each view and moves the MSC along the z-direction during gantry rotation to change the undersampling pattern. It enables reconstruction of images from undersampled data using CS algorithms. The purpose of this work is to design the spacing and width of the MSC slits and the MSC motion patterns based on beam separation, undersampling efficiency, and image quality. The development and testing of a SparseCT prototype with the designed MSC will be described in a following paper. Methods:
      
    

    
      We chose a few initial MSC designs based on the guidance from two metrics: beam separation and undersampling efficiency. Both beam separation and undersampling efficiency were measured from numerically simulated photon distribution with MSC taken into consideration. Beam separation measures the separation between x-ray beams from consecutive slits, taking into account penumbra effects on both sides of each slit. Undersampling efficiency measures the dose-weighted similarity between penumbra undersampling and binary undersampling, in other words, the effective contribution of the incident dose to the signal to noise ratio of the projection data. We then compared the initially chosen MSC designs in terms of their reconstruction image quality. SparseCT projections were simulated from fully sampled patient projection data according to the MSC design and motion pattern, reconstructed iteratively using a sparsity-enforcing penalized weighted least squares cost function with ordered subsets/momentum algorithm, and compared visually and quantitatively. Results:
      
    

    
      Simulated photon distributions indicate that the size of the penumbra is dominated by the size of the focal spot. Therefore, a wider MSC slit and a smaller focal spot lead to increased beam separation and undersampling efficiency. For fourfold undersampling with a 1.2 mm focal spot, a minimum MSC slit width of three detector rows (projected to the detector surface) is needed for beam separation; for threefold undersampling, a minimum slit width of four detector rows is needed. Simulations of SparseCT projection and reconstruction indicate that the motion pattern of the MSC does not have a visible impact on image quality. An MSC slit width of three or four detector rows yields similar image quality. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The MSC is the key component of the SparseCT method. Simulations of MSC designs incorporating x-ray beam penumbra effects showed that for threefold and fourfold dose reductions, an MSC slit width of four detector rows provided reasonable beam separation, undersampling efficiency, and image quality.","['1 Department of Radiology, NYU School of Medicine, New York, NY, 10016, USA.', '2 Institute of Computer Graphics and Vision, Graz University of Technology, Graz, 8010, Austria.', ""3 Department of Radiology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, 02115, USA."", '4 Siemens Healthineers, Malvern, PA, 19355, USA.', '5 Siemens Healthineers, Forchheim, 91301, Germany.', '6 Department of Medical Physics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, 10065, USA.', '7 Department of Radiology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, 10065, USA.']","Baiyu Chen, Erich Kobler, Matthew J Muckley, Aaron D Sodickson, Thomas O'Donnell, Thomas Flohr, Bernhard Schmidt, Daniel K Sodickson, Ricardo Otazo, ",Medical physics,2019 Jun,CT; SparseCT; Undersampling; compressed sensing; multislit collimator (MSC); penumbra.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30980728

      A range of endophenotypes characterise psychosis, however there has been limited work understanding if and how they are inter-related. Methods:
      
    

    
      This multi-centre study includes 8754 participants: 2212 people with a psychotic disorder, 1487 unaffected relatives of probands, and 5055 healthy controls. We investigated cognition [digit span (N = 3127), block design (N = 5491), and the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (N = 3543)], electrophysiology [P300 amplitude and latency (N = 1102)], and neuroanatomy [lateral ventricular volume (N = 1721)]. We used linear regression to assess the interrelationships between endophenotypes. Results:
      
    

    
      The P300 amplitude and latency were not associated (regression coef. -0.06, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.01, p = 0.060), and P300 amplitude was positively associated with block design (coef. 0.19, 95% CI 0.10-0.28, p 0.38). All the cognitive endophenotypes were associated with each other in the expected directions (all p < 0.001). Lastly, the relationships between pairs of endophenotypes were consistent in all three participant groups, differing for some of the cognitive pairings only in the strengths of the relationships. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The P300 amplitude and latency are independent endophenotypes; the former indexing spatial visualisation and working memory, and the latter is hypothesised to index basic processing speed. Individuals with psychotic illnesses, their unaffected relatives, and healthy controls all show similar patterns of associations between endophenotypes, endorsing the theory of a continuum of psychosis liability across the population.","['1 Division of Psychiatry,University College London,London,UK.', '2 Department of Psychiatry,Brain Centre Rudolf Magnus,University Medical Center Utrecht,Utrecht,The Netherlands.', ""3 Institute of Psychiatry Psychology and Neuroscience at King's College London and South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust,London,UK."", '4 CIBERSAM,Centro Investigación Biomédica en Red Salud Mental,Madrid,Spain.', '5 Centre for Clinical Research in Neuropsychiatry,The University of Western Australia,Perth,Western Australia,Australia.', '6 Psychology Research Laboratory,Harvard Medical School,McLean Hospital,Belmont, MA,USA.', '7 Harry Perkins Institute of Medical Research and Centre for Medical Research,The University of Western Australia,Perth,Australia.', '8 Department of Psychiatry,Clinical Science Institute,National University of Ireland Galway,Ireland.', '9 Division of Psychiatry,University of Edinburgh,Royal Edinburgh Hospital,Edinburgh,UK.', '10 Department of Psychiatry,Ludwig-Maximilians University of Munich,Munich,Germany.', '11 North East London Foundation Trust,London,UK.', '12 Department of Psychiatry and Psychology,Maastricht University Medical Centre,EURON,Maastricht,The Netherlands.']","R Blakey, S Ranlund, E Zartaloudi, W Cahn, S Calafato, M Colizzi, B Crespo-Facorro, C Daniel, Á Díez-Revuelta, M Di Forti, GROUP, C Iyegbe, A Jablensky, R Jones, M-H Hall, R Kahn, L Kalaydjieva, E Kravariti, K Lin, C McDonald, A M McIntosh, M Picchioni, J Powell, A Presman, D Rujescu, K Schulze, M Shaikh, J H Thygesen, T Toulopoulou, N Van Haren, J Van Os, M Walshe, R M Murray, E Bramon, ",Psychological medicine,2018 Jun,Lateral ventricular volume; P300; schizophrenia; unaffected relatives; verbal memory; working memory.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29094675
503,Updates in medical professional liability: a primer for electrophysiologists,"Medical professional liability (MPL), traditionally known as medical malpractice, affects most electrophysiologists some point during their career, either directly through personal experience or indirectly by the experiences of colleagues. Despite this, most physicians struggle to accurately describe MPL in the context of clinical practice. Providers know little about the outcomes of malpractice claims as reporting of settled or litigated MPL cases is sparse in the medical literature. In the USA, individual patients can file a malpractice claim in a tort-based system, whereas in other parts of the world, no-fault malpractice systems are increasingly prevalent. Tort reform remains a topic of much debate as the economic costs of malpractice contribute to the ever-expanding costs of health care in the USA. This review provides a framework to define MPL, describes the tort and no-fault systems of malpractice, and details the economic impacts of MPL on health care and the practice of cardiology in the USA. Current policy trends towards MPL including tort reform are reviewed, and MPL as it relates to the practice of cardiac electrophysiology is detailed.","['1 Department of Cardiology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32607, USA. christopher.austin@medicine.ufl.edu.', '2 Division of Cardiovascular Disease, Mayo Clinic Florida, Jacksonville, FL, USA.']","Christopher Austin, Fred Kusumoto, ",Journal of interventional cardiac electrophysiology : an international journal of arrhythmias and pacing,2019 Nov,Cardiology; Electrophysiology; MPL; Malpractice; Medical malpractice; Medical professional liability; Tort.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30276591
504,Electrophysiological Multimodal Assessments Improve Outcome Prediction in Traumatic Cervical Spinal Cord Injury,"Outcome prediction after spinal cord injury (SCI) is essential for early counseling and orientation of the rehabilitative intervention. Moreover, prognostication of outcome is crucial to achieving meaningful stratification when conceiving clinical trials. Neurophysiological examinations are commonly employed for prognostication after SCI, but whether neurophysiology could improve the functional prognosis based on clinical predictors remains an open question. Data of 224 patients included in the European Multicenter Study about Spinal Cord Injury were analyzed with bootstrapping analysis and multivariate logistical regression to derive prediction models of complete functional recovery in the chronic stage after traumatic cervical SCI. Within 40 days after SCI, we evaluated age, gender, the motor and sensory cumulative scores of the International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI), and neurophysiological variables (motor evoked potentials, sensory evoked potentials, nerve conduction study) as possible predictors. Positive outcome was defined by a Spinal Cord Independence Measure total score of 100. Analyzing clinical variables, we derived a prediction model based on the ISNCSCI total motor score and age: the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) was 0.936 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.904-0.968).

505,Two-Photon Absorption Properties of Gold Fluorescent Protein: A Combined Molecular Dynamics and Quantum Chemistry Study,"Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out to obtain the conformational changes of the chromophore in the gold fluorescent protein (PDB ID: 1OXF ). To obtain two-photon absorption (TPA) cross-sections, time dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) computations were performed for chromophore geometries sampled along the trajectory. The TD-DFT computations used the CAM-B3LYP functional and 6-31+G(d) basis set. Results showed that two dihedral angles change remarkably over the simulation time. TPA cross-sections were found to average 13.82 GM for the excitation to S1 computed from the equilibrium geometries; however, extending the structures with a water molecule and GLU residue, which make H bonds with the chromophore molecule, increased excitation energies and TPA cross-sections significantly. Besides the effects of the surrounding residues and the dihedrals on the spectroscopic properties, some bond lengths affected the excitation energies and the TPA cross-sections significantly (up to ±25-30%), while the effects of the bond angles were smaller (±5%). Overall the present results provide insight into the effects of the conformational flexibility on TPA (with gold fluorescent protein as a specific example) and suggest that further experimental measurements of TPA for the gold fluorescent protein should be undertaken.","['1 Vocational School of Health Services , Gazi University , 06560 Ankara , Turkey.', '2 Department of Chemistry , University of Alberta , Edmonton , AB T6G 2G2 , Canada.']","Yusuf Şimşek, Alex Brown, ",The journal of physical chemistry.

506,Tissue-adhesive wirelessly powered optoelectronic device for metronomic photodynamic cancer therapy,"Metronomic (that is, low-dose and long-term) photodynamic therapy (mPDT) for treating internal lesions requires the stable fixation of optical devices to internal tissue surfaces to enable continuous, local light delivery. Surgical suturing-the standard choice for device fixation-can be unsuitable in the presence of surrounding major nerves and blood vessels, as well as for organs or tissues that are fragile, change their shape or actively move. Here, we show that an implantable and wirelessly powered mPDT device consisting of near-field-communication-based light-emitting-diode chips and bioadhesive and stretchable polydopamine-modified poly(dimethylsiloxane) nanosheets can be stably fixed onto the inner surface of animal tissue. When implanted subcutaneously in mice with intradermally transplanted tumours, the device led to significant antitumour effects by irradiating for 10 d at approximately 1,000-fold lower intensity than conventional PDT approaches. The mPDT device might facilitate treatment strategies for hard-to-detect microtumours and deeply located lesions that are hard to reach with standard phototherapy.","['1 Graduate School of Advanced Science and Engineering, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan.', '2 Division of Hepato-Biliary-Pancreatic Surgery and Transplantation, Department of Surgery, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', '3 Institute of Advanced Active Aging Research, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan.', '4 Department of Pediatric Surgery, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', '5 Waseda Research Institute for Science and Engineering, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan.', '6 Department of Physiology, National Defense Medical College, Saitama, Japan. moyan@ndmc.ac.jp.', '7 Waseda Institute for Advanced Study, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan. t.fujie@aoni.waseda.jp.', '8 Japan Science and Technology Agency, PRESTO, Saitama, Japan. t.fujie@aoni.waseda.jp.']","Kento Yamagishi, Izumi Kirino, Isao Takahashi, Hizuru Amano, Shinji Takeoka, Yuji Morimoto, Toshinori Fujie, ",Nature biomedical engineering,2019 Jan,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30932063

      To compare different K readings in pseudophakic patients post-Descemet's stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) and evaluate corresponding prediction errors in intraocular lens (IOL) power calculations. Methods:
      
    

    
      Subjects that underwent cataract surgery and DSAEK surgery at least 3 and 6 months prior, respectively, and IOL implantation in the capsular bag were included in this study. Manifest refraction and IOL information were recorded. A Scheimpflug keratometer (Pentacam) was used for corneal measurements, including the mean anterior and posterior radii of curvature, simulated keratometer (SimK), true net power (TNP), and equivalent K reading (EKR) at the 4.0-mm zone. Conventional keratometry was acquired using the IOLMaster (KMaster). The four K measurements were evaluated for calculating the predicted refraction. Results:
      
    

    
      The study included 20 eyes from 19 subjects. The ratio of the posterior to the anterior corneal radius was 74.1 ± 3.24%. Comparison of the four keratometric methods (KMaster, SimK, EKR, and TNP) revealed statistically significant differences among all the methods besides KMaster and SimK. Of the four IOL calculation methods(KMaster, SimK, EKR and TNP method),the arithmetic prediction error of the KMaster, SimK, and EKR methods featured nonsignificant differences from zero(p = 0.07, 0.19 and 0.84 respectively); the EKR method calculated the highest percentage of eyes with IOLs within the prediction error. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      IOL calculations in post-DSAEK eyes using KMaster, SimK, and EKR can yield small refractive errors after surgery. The EKR (4.0-mm diameter) method was found to be the most accurate.","[""1 Department of Ophthalmology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Restoration of Damaged Ocular Nerve, Peking University Third Hospital, 49 North Garden Road, Haidian District, Beijing, 100191, People's Republic of China."", ""2 Department of Ophthalmology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Restoration of Damaged Ocular Nerve, Peking University Third Hospital, 49 North Garden Road, Haidian District, Beijing, 100191, People's Republic of China. docqihong@163.com.""]","Ke Xu, Hong Qi, Rongmei Peng, Gege Xiao, Jing Hong, Yansheng Hao, Boping Ma, ",BMC ophthalmology,2018,Descemet’s stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty; IOL; Keratometry; Pentacam.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30332995

Cardiac electrophysiology is one of the most advanced areas, with cardiac modelling and simulation being considered for virtual testing of pharmacological therapies and medical devices. Current models present inconsistencies with experimental data, which limit further progress. In this study, we present the design, development, calibration and independent validation of a human-based ventricular model (ToR-ORd) for simulations of electrophysiology and excitation-contraction coupling, from ionic to whole-organ dynamics, including the electrocardiogram. Validation based on substantial multiscale simulations supports the credibility of the ToR-ORd model under healthy and key disease conditions, as well as drug blockade. In addition, the process uncovers new theoretical insights into the biophysical properties of the L-type calcium current, which are critical for sodium and calcium dynamics. These insights enable the reformulation of L-type calcium current, as well as replacement of the hERG current model.","['1 Department of Computer Science, British Heart Foundation Centre of Research Excellence, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', '2 Department of Electrical, Electronic, and Information Engineering ""Guglielmo Marconi"", University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', '3 Department of Physiology, McGill University, Montreal, Canada.', '4 Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacotherapy, Faculty of Medicine, University of Szeged, Szeged, Hungary.']","Jakub Tomek, Alfonso Bueno-Orovio, Elisa Passini, Xin Zhou, Ana Minchole, Oliver Britton, Chiara Bartolucci, Stefano Severi, Alvin Shrier, Laszlo Virag, Andras Varro, Blanca Rodriguez, ",eLife,2019,calibration validation; cell biology; computational biology; computer simulations; heart; human; systems biology; ventricular myocyte.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31868580

      To analyse the predictability of diverse intraocular lens (IOL) power calculation formulae in paediatric patients with congenital cataract. Methods:
      
    

    
      The medical records of patients who underwent cataract surgery and posterior chamber IOL implantation (in-the-bag) for congenital cataract before 17 years of age were reviewed retrospectively. Target refractions calculated by Sanders-Retzlaff-Kraff (SRK)/II, SRK/T and Hoffer-Q formulae were compared with the actual refraction. Patients were subgroup according to the age at IOL implantation (age group 0-24 months, 25-60 months, 61-120 months, 121-203 months), and we compared mean prediction error (PE) and mean absolute error (AE) for each formula. Corrected AE was obtained by linear regression analysis. Results:
      
    

    
      Totally 481 eyes were included in the final analysis. Both SRK/II and SRK/T yielded the lowest mean AE in the age group 0-24 months and SRK/II yielded the lowest mean AE in the age group 25-60 months. For every formula, the mean PE was positive during the first five years of age, which converged to zero according to age as IOL implantation increases. The tendency for immediate postoperative overcorrection in younger patients (<6 years) could be improved by corrected formulae based on the linear regression equation. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Patients with congenital cataract who underwent IOL implantation within 5 years of age showed higher AE than the older ones did. Among the three formulae evaluated, SRK/II consistently provided the best predictive result in these patients. For patients aged >10 years, all three formulae showed favourable predictive abilities.","['1 Department of Biomedical Sciences, College of Medicine, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea.', '2 HanGil Eye Hospital, Catholic Kwandong University College of Medicine, Incheon, South Korea.', '3 Department of Ophthalmology, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, South Korea.', '4 Department of Ophthalmology, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, South Korea ysyu@snu.ac.kr.']","Byung Joo Lee, Sang-Mok Lee, Jeong Hun Kim, Young Suk Yu, ",The British journal of ophthalmology,2019 Jan,child health (paediatrics); lens and zonules; treatment surgery.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29605815
510,"Comparative study of extracellular recording methods for analysis of afferent sensory information: Empirical modeling, data analysis and interpretation","Background:
      
    

    
      Physiological studies of sensorial systems often require the acquisition and processing of data extracted from their multiple components to evaluate how the neural information changes in relation to the environment changes. In this work, a comparative study about methodological aspects of two electrophysiological approaches is described. New method:
      
    

    
      Extracellular recordings from deep vibrissal nerves were obtained by using a customized microelectrode Utah array during passive mechanical stimulation of rat´s whiskers. These recordings were compared with those obtained with bipolar electrodes. We also propose here a simplified empirical model of the electrophysiological activity obtained from a bundle of myelinated nerve fibers. Results:
      
    

    
      The peripheral activity of the vibrissal system was characterized through the temporal and spectral features obtained with both recording methods. The empirical model not only allows the correlation between anatomical structures and functional features, but also allows to predict changes in the CAPs morphology when the arrangement and the geometry of the electrodes changes. Comparison with existing method(s):
      
    

    
      This study compares two extracellular recording methods based on analysis techniques, empirical modeling and data processing of vibrissal sensory information. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      This comparative study reveals a close relationship between the electrophysiological techniques and the processing methods necessary to extract sensory information. This relationship is the result of maximizing the extraction of information from recordings of sensory activity.","['1 Laboratorio de Medios e Interfases (LAMEIN), Departamento de Bioingeniería, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Tecnología, Universidad Nacional de Tucumán, Tucumán, Argentina; Instituto Superior de Investigaciones Biológicas (INSIBIO), Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET), Tucumán, Argentina.

Epilepsy-on-a-chip model was validated by chronic electrical recording, neuronal survival quantification, and anticonvulsant test. To demonstrate the application of μflow-MEA in drug discovery, we utilized a two-stage screening platform to identify potential targets for antiepileptic drugs.

Such studies are often performed over multiple MS runs, potentially resulting in introduction of MS run bias that could affect downstream analysis. Such MS data have therefore commonly been normalized using a reference sample which is included in each MS run. We show, however, that reference normalization does not effectively remove systematic MS run bias. A linear model approach was previously proposed to improve on the reference normalization approach but does not computationally scale to larger data sets. Here we describe the NOMAD (normalization of mass spectrometry data) R package which implements a computationally efficient ANOVA normalization approach with protein assembly functionality. NOMAD provides the same advantages as the linear regression solution but is more computationally efficient which allows superior scaling to larger sample sizes. Moreover, NOMAD effectively removes bias which improves valid across MS run comparisons.","['1 Department of Oncology-Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.', '2 Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine and VAMC, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', '3 Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Biophysics, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis, MN, USA; Center for Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', '4 Department of Oncology-Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.

519,Estimation of energy absorption buildup factors of some human tissues at energies relevant to brachytherapy and external beam radiotherapy,"Purpose: Estimation of energy absorption buildup factors (EABFs) of some human tissues for photon energies commonly used in brachytherapy (BT) and external beam radiotherapy (EBRT).Methods: A five parameter geometric progression (G-P) fitting approximation was used to estimate EABF at different energies and penetration depths (up to 20 mfp). MCNP6.1 was used to obtain EABF for comparison.Results: For radiation sources with lower mean energies (MEs), adipose tissue, which has lowest Zeq, has highest EABF values while bone, which has highest Zeq, has lowest EABF values. EABF reaches to a maximum value (EABFmax∼550) for Ir-192 BT source, which has a mean energy of 0.35 MeV. The radiation sources (MEs from 300 keV to a few MeV) were found to have higher values of EABF. At higher energies, e.g. 5 MeV, the annihilation photons contribute EABF at higher penetration depths, e.g. 20 mfp. In general, both MCNP and GP fitted EABF values along with available experimental data were found to agree well.Conclusions: EABFs of various human tissues have been investigated at radiation source energies relevant to BT and EBRT extensively.

522,A multi-omic analysis reveals the role of fumarate in regulating the virulence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli,"The enteric pathogen enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is responsible for outbreaks of bloody diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) worldwide. Several molecular mechanisms have been described for the pathogenicity of EHEC; however, the role of bacterial metabolism in the virulence of EHEC during infection in vivo remains unclear. Here we show that aerobic metabolism plays an important role in the regulation of EHEC virulence in Caenorhabditis elegans. Our functional genomic analyses showed that disruption of the genes encoding the succinate dehydrogenase complex (Sdh) of EHEC, including the sdhA gene, attenuated its toxicity toward C. elegans animals. Sdh converts succinate to fumarate and links the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the electron transport chain (ETC) simultaneously. Succinate accumulation and fumarate depletion in the EHEC sdhA mutant cells were also demonstrated to be concomitant by metabolomic analyses. Moreover, fumarate replenishment to the sdhA mutant significantly increased its virulence toward C. elegans. These results suggest that the TCA cycle, ETC, and alteration in metabolome all account for the attenuated toxicity of the sdhA mutant, and Sdh catabolite fumarate in particular plays a critical role in the regulation of EHEC virulence. In addition, we identified the tryptophanase (TnaA) as a downstream virulence determinant of SdhA using a label-free proteomic method. We demonstrated that expression of tnaA is regulated by fumarate in EHEC. Taken together, our multi-omic analyses demonstrate that sdhA is required for the virulence of EHEC, and aerobic metabolism plays important roles in the pathogenicity of EHEC infection in C. elegans.

527,Optical dispersion control in surfactant-free DNA thin films by vitamin B 2 doping,"A new route to systematically control the optical dispersion properties of surfactant-free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) thin solid films was developed by doping them with vitamin B2, also known as riboflavin. Surfactant-free DNA solid films of high optical quality were successfully deposited on various types of substrates by spin coating of aqueous solutions without additional chemical processes, with thicknesses ranging from 18 to 100 nm. Optical properties of the DNA films were investigated by measuring UV-visible-NIR transmission, and their refractive indices were measured using variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry. By doping DNA solid films with riboflavin, the refractive index was consistently increased with an index difference Δn ≥ 0.015 in the spectral range from 500 to 900 nm, which is sufficiently large to make an all-DNA optical waveguide. Detailed correlation between the optical dispersion and riboflavin concentration was experimentally investigated and thermo-optic coefficients of the DNA-riboflavin thin solid films were also experimentally measured in the temperature range from 20 to 85 °C, opening the potential to new bio-thermal sensing applications.","['1 Photonic Device Physics Laboratory, Institute of Physics and Applied Physics, Yonsei University, Seoul, 120-749, South Korea.', '2 Samsung Electronics, Hwasong, Gyeonggi-do, 18448, South Korea.', '3 Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, 02115, USA.', '4 Wellman Center for Photomedicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, 02114, USA.', '5 Sungkyunkwan Advanced Institute of Nanotechnology (SAINT) and Department of Physics, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, 440-746, South Korea.', '6 Space Optics Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science, Daejeon, 34113, South Korea.', '7 Photonic Device Physics Laboratory, Institute of Physics and Applied Physics, Yonsei University, Seoul, 120-749, South Korea. koh@yonsei.ac.kr.']","Bjorn Paulson, Inchul Shin, Hayoung Jeong, Byungjoo Kong, Reza Khazaeinezhad, Sreekantha Reddy Dugasani, Woohyun Jung, Boram Joo, Hoi-Youn Lee, Sungha Park, Kyunghwan Oh, ",Scientific reports,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29921918

530,Effects of fixation on electrophysiology and structure of human jejunal villi,"The villi of human jejunum vary in size and shape during different functional conditions. In the base the lamina propria is isotonic with blood, in the tip hyperosmotic. Here we study electrophysiological and morphological effects of incubation in hypotonic, isotonic, or hypertonic solutions, and to test various isotonic fixatives for microscopy. Samples of jejunal mucosae, obtained during surgery in obese patients, were studied in Ussing chambers where electrical parameters were registered during incubation in Krebs solution at various osmolarities, and during fixation in formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, or osmium tetroxide (OsO4 ). The same fixatives were used for other jejunal specimens that were fixed directly for light microscopy. Morphometry was carried out to determine size and height of villi, proportion of lamina propria, and surface enlargement due to villi. Ussing chamber incubation in fluids with low osmolarity resulted in increased electrical resistance and epithelial swelling. Opposite results were obtained at high osmolality. Fixation was faster in formaldehyde than in glutaraldehyde or OsO4 . In biopsies processed directly for light microscopy the proportions of lamina propria of the mucosa, and of lamina propria of villi, were significantly larger in biopsies fixed in formaldehyde than after fixation in glutaraldehyde or OsO4 . The villus tips sometimes ended with a bleb with prominent spaces between the epithelial cells. In summary, jejunal villi swell in vitro when exposed to hypotonic solutions, and shrink in hypertonic solutions. Much of the morphological changes occurring during fixation can be related to the physiological hyperosmolar milieu in villus tips.","['1 Department of Gastrosurgical Research and Education, Institute of Clinical Sciences, Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.']","Anna Casselbrant, Herbert F Helander, ",Microscopy research and technique,2018 Apr,Ussing chamber; fixation; human; jejunum; microscopy; morphometry; osmolarity; villus structure.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29322584
531,Variation in opsin transcript expression explains intraretinal differences in spectral sensitivity of the northern anchovy,"Vertebrate retinal photoreceptors house visual pigments that absorb light to begin the process of vision. The light absorbed by a visual pigment depends on its two molecular components: protein (opsin) and chromophore (a vitamin A derivative). Although an increasing number of studies show intraretinal variability in visual pigment content, it is only for two mammals (human and mouse) and two birds (chicken and pigeon) that such variability has been demonstrated to underlie differences in spectral sensitivity of the animal. Here, we show that the spectral sensitivity of the northern anchovy varies with retinal quadrant and that this variability can be explained by differences in the expression of opsin transcripts. Retinal (vitamin A1) was the only chromophore detected in the retina, ruling out this molecular component as a source of variation in spectral sensitivity. Chromatic adaptation experiments further showed that the dorsal retina had the capacity to mediate color vision. Together with published results for the ventral retina, this study is the first to demonstrate that intraretinal opsin variability in a fish drives corresponding variation in the animal's spectral sensitivity.","['1 Department of Biological Sciences,Simon Fraser University,Burnaby,British Columbia V5A 1S6,Canada.']","Ilaria Savelli, Iñigo Novales Flamarique, ",Visual neuroscience,2018 Jan,Anchovy; Chromophore; Color vision; Cone photoreceptor; Optic nerve.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29905129

A hybrid focusing system in combination with a Kirkpatrick-Baez mirror was applied for compensation of a small spatial acceptance of the ellipsoidal mirror. With this system, the soft X-ray FEL pulses were focused down to 480 nm × 680 nm with an extremely high intensity of 8.8×1016 W cm-2 at a photon energy of 120 eV, which yielded saturable absorption at the L-edge of Si (99.8 eV) with a drastic increase of transmittance from 8% to 48%.","['1 Department of Chemistry, School of Science, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo, Tokyo 113-8656, Japan.', '2 RIKEN SPring-8 Center, 1-1-1 Koto, Sayo-cho, Sayo-gun, Hyogo 679-5148, Japan.', '3 Department of Precision Engineering, School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo, Tokyo 113-8656, Japan.']","Hiroto Motoyama, Shigeki Owada, Gota Yamaguchi, Takehiro Kume, Satoru Egawa, Kensuke Tono, Yuichi Inubushi, Takahisa Koyama, Makina Yabashi, Haruhiko Ohashi, Hidekazu Mimura, ",Journal of synchrotron radiation,2019,ellipsoidal mirror; optical design; saturable absorption; soft X-ray free-electron laser.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31490128
533,Measuring the effective area and charge density of platinum electrodes for bionic devices,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Neural stimulation is usually performed with fairly large platinum electrodes. Smaller electrodes increase the applied charge density, potentially damaging the electrode. Greater understanding of the charge injection mechanism is required for safe neural stimulation. Approach:
      
    

    
      The charge injection mechanism and charge injection capacity were measured by cyclic voltammetry. Electrodes were cleaned mechanically or by potential cycling in acidic solutions. The effective electrode area was measured by hydrogen adsorption or reduction of [Formula: see text]. Main results:
      
    

    
      The water window and safe potential window were affected by changes to electrolyte, electrode size, polishing method and oxygen concentration. Capacitance and Faradaic current contribute to the charge injection capacity. Varying voltammetric scan rate (measurement time), electrode size, polishing method, potential window, electrolyte and oxygen concentration affected the charge injection capacity and ratio of oxidation to reduction charge. Hydrogen adsorption in acidic solutions provided an inaccurate effective electrode area. Reduction of a solution phase redox species with a linear or radial diffusion profile could provide an effective electrode area. The charge density (charge injection capacity divided by electrode area) of a platinum electrode is dependent on the charge injection capacity and electrode area measurement technique. By varying cyclic voltammetric conditions, the charge density of platinum ranged from 0.15 to 5.57 mC cm-2. Significance:
      
    

    
      The safe potential window, charge injection mechanism, charge injection capacity and charge density of platinum depends on electrolyte, size of the electrode, oxygen concentration and differences in electrode polishing method. The oxidation and reduction charge injection capacities are not equal. Careful control of a platinum electrodes surface may allow larger charge densities and safe use of smaller electrodes. New electrode materials and geometries should be tested in a consistent manner to allow comparison of potential suitability for neural stimulation.","['1 ARC Centre of Excellence for Electromaterials Science, Intelligent Polymer Research Institute, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.

534,Puncture-and-Pull Biomechanics in the Teeth of Predatory Coelurosaurian Dinosaurs,"The teeth of putatively carnivorous dinosaurs are often blade-shaped with well-defined serrated cutting edges (Figure 1). These ziphodont teeth are often easily differentiated based on the morphology and density of the denticles [1, 2]. A tearing function has been proposed for theropod denticles in general [3], but the functional significance of denticle phenotypic variation has received less attention. In particular, the unusual hooked denticles found in troodontids suggest a different feeding strategy or diet compared to other small theropods. We used a two-pronged approach to investigate the function of denticle shape variation across theropods with both congruent body shapes and sizes (e.g., dromaeosaurids versus troodontids) and highly disparate body shapes and sizes (e.g., troodontids versus tyrannosaurids), using microwear and finite element analyses (Figure 1). We found that many toothed coelurosaurian theropods employed a puncture-and-pull feeding movement, in which parallel scratches form while biting down into prey and oblique scratches form as the head is pulled backward with the jaws closed. In finite element simulations, theropod teeth had the lowest stresses when bite forces were aligned with the oblique family of microwear scratches. Different denticle morphologies performed differently under a variety of simulated biting angles: Dromaeosaurus and Saurornitholestes were well-adapted for handling struggling prey, whereas troodontid teeth were more likely to fail at non-optimal bite angles. Troodontids may have favored softer, smaller, or immobile prey.","['1 Departamento de Ciencias Humanas, Universidad de La Rioja, 26004, Logroño, La Rioja, Spain.

536,Benchmarking of Monte Carlo model of Siemens Oncor® linear accelerator for 18MV photon beam: Determination of initial electron beam parameters,"Objective:
      
    

    
      This study aims to benchmark a Monte Carlo (MC) model of the 18 MV photon beam produced by the Siemens Oncor® linac using the BEAMnrc and DOSXYZnrc codes. Methods:
      
    

    
      By matching the percentage depth doses and beam profiles calculated by MC simulations with measurements, the initial electron beam parameters including electron energy, full width at half maximum (spatial FWHM), and mean angular spread were derived for the 10×10 cm2 and 20×20 cm2 field sizes. The MC model of the 18 MV photon beam was then validated against the measurements for different field sizes (5×5, 30×30 and 40×40 cm2) by gamma index analysis. Results:
      
    

    
      The optimum values for electron energy, spatial FWHM and mean angular spread were 14.2 MeV, 0.08 cm and 0.8 degree, respectively. The MC simulations yielded the comparable measurement results of these optimum parameters. The gamma passing rates (with acceptance criteria of 1% /1 mm) for percentage depth doses were found to be 100% for all field sizes. For cross-line profiles, the gamma passing rates were 100%, 97%, 95%, 96% and 95% for 5×5, 10×10, 20×20, 30×30 and 40×40 cm2 field sizes, respectively. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      By validation of the MC model of Siemens Oncor® linac using various field sizes, it was found that both dose profiles of small and large field sizes were very sensitive to the changes in spatial FWHM and mean angular spread of the primary electron beam from the bending magnet. Hence, it is recommended that both small and large field sizes of the 18 MV photon beams should be considered in the Monte Carlo linac modeling.","['1 Department of Radiology, Faculty of Para-Medicine, Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences, Bandare-Abbas, Iran.', '2 Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, School of Para Medical Science, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran.', '3 Department of Energy Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran.', '4 Department of Medical Physics, Faculty of Medicine, Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Semnan, Iran.', '5 Department of Medical Physics, Faculty of Medicine, Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences, Yazd, Iran.', '6 Department of Medical Physics and Radiology, Faculty of Paramedical Sciences, Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, Iran.', '7 Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', '8 Radiation Medicine Program, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.']","Milad Najafzadeh, Mojtaba Hoseini-Ghafarokhi, Rezgar Shahi Mayn Bolagh, Mohammad Haghparast, Shiva Zarifi, Abolfazl Nickfarjam, Bagher Farhood, James C L Chow, ",Journal of X-ray science and technology,2019,Monte Carlo simulation; Radiotherapy; Siemens Oncor; benchmarking; gamma analysis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31498147

Compared to traditional sensor arrays composed of a series of sensor elements, single-system based discriminative sensors using an array of optical changes at different wavelengths to provide input signals have drawn intensive attention recently. On the one hand, they can provide discrimination ability that is lack in using selective sensors; on the other hand, they can simplify the complex data acquisition process accompanied by multiple-element-based sensor arrays and reduce consumption of sensor samples. This tutorial review gives an overview of the development of single-system based discriminative optical sensors. Different strategies for the construction of single-system based discriminative sensors including dynamic combinatorial libraries, cross-reactive conjugated polymers, DNA G-quadruplex ensembles, combinatorial fluorescent molecular sensors, and fluorophore/surfactant aggregate ensembles are particularly introduced.","[""1 Key Laboratory of Applied Surface and Colloid Chemistry of Ministry of Education, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an, 710062, PR China. dinglp33@snnu.edu.cn.""]","Junmei Fan, Liping Ding, ",The Analyst,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29974083
538,t-SNE Visualization of Large-Scale Neural Recordings,"Electrophysiology is entering the era of big data. Multiple probes, each with hundreds to thousands of individual electrodes, are now capable of simultaneously recording from many brain regions. The major challenge confronting these new technologies is transforming the raw data into physiologically meaningful signals, that is, single unit spikes. Sorting the spike events of individual neurons from a spatiotemporally dense sampling of the extracellular electric field is a problem that has attracted much attention (Rey, Pedreira, & Quian Quiroga, 2015 ; Rossant et al., 2016 ) but is still far from solved. Current methods still rely on human input and thus become unfeasible as the size of the data sets grows exponentially. Here we introduce the [Formula: see text]-student stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) dimensionality reduction method (Van der Maaten & Hinton, 2008 ) as a visualization tool in the spike sorting process. t-SNE embeds the [Formula: see text]-dimensional extracellular spikes ([Formula: see text] = number of features by which each spike is decomposed) into a low- (usually two-) dimensional space. We show that such embeddings, even starting from different feature spaces, form obvious clusters of spikes that can be easily visualized and manually delineated with a high degree of precision. We propose that these clusters represent single units and test this assertion by applying our algorithm on labeled data sets from both hybrid (Rossant et al., 2016 ) and paired juxtacellular/extracellular recordings (Neto et al., 2016 ). We have released a graphical user interface (GUI) written in Python as a tool for the manual clustering of the t-SNE embedded spikes and as a tool for an informed overview and fast manual curation of results from different clustering algorithms. Furthermore, the generated visualizations offer evidence in favor of the use of probes with higher density and smaller electrodes. They also graphically demonstrate the diverse nature of the sorting problem when spikes are recorded with different methods and arise from regions with different background spiking statistics.","['1 Sainsbury Wellcome Centre, UCL, London W1T 4JG, U.K. g.dimitriadis@ucl.ac.uk.', '2 Sainsbury Wellcome Centre, UCL, London W1T 4JG, U.K. j.neto@ucl.ac.uk.', '3 Sainsbury Wellcome Centre, UCL, London W1T 4JG, U.K. a.kampff@ucl.ac.uk.']","George Dimitriadis, Joana P Neto, Adam R Kampff, ",Neural computation,2018 Jul,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29894653

      To quantify the impact of tumor-associated resistance factors on local tumor control after split doses of carbon (12C-) ions or photons in an experimental prostate tumor model. Material and methods:
      
    

    
      Three sublines (AT1, H, HI) of syngeneic rat prostate tumors (R3327) differing in growth rate, differentiation and hypoxic status were irradiated with split doses of either 12C-ions or 6MV photons. Dose-response curves were determined for the endpoint local tumor control within 300 days. The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of 12C-ions was calculated from the TCD50-values (dose at 50% control probability) of photons and 12C-ions. Results:
      
    

    
      Experimental findings demonstrated: (i) The RBE was highest for the least differentiated AT1-tumor (2.39 ± 0.16 (AT1) vs 2.06 ± 0.11 (H) and 2.03 ± 0.17 (HI)). (ii) TCD50-values between the three tumor sublines differed much less for 12C-ions (26.0-37.9 Gy) than for photons (53.7-90.6 Gy). (iii) While the slope of the dose-response curves for photons and 12C-ions were very similar for the AT1- and H-tumors, the histologically heterogeneous HI-tumor showed a shallow dose-response curve for photons, which is transformed into a steep dose-response curve after 12C-ion irradiation. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The response to carbon ion irradiations is much less dependent on biological differences between and within the tumor-sublines. Tumors showing a high resistance against photon treatments, also exhibit the largest RBE for carbon ions. Carbon ions could therefore be of clinical advantage for the treatment of tumors with known resistance factors against photons.","['1 Department of Radiation Oncology and Radiotherapy, University Hospital Heidelberg, Germany; Department of Medical Physics in Radiation Oncology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany; Heidelberg Institute for Radiation Oncology (HIRO), National Center for Radiation Research in Oncology (NCRO), Heidelberg, Germany.

542,Highly Efficient Transfer of 7TM Membrane Protein from Native Membrane to Covalently Circularized Nanodisc,"Incorporating membrane proteins into membrane mimicking systems is an essential process for biophysical studies and structure determination. Monodisperse lipid nanodiscs have been found to be a suitable tool, as they provide a near-native lipid bilayer environment. Recently, a covalently circularized nanodisc (cND) assembled with a membrane scaffold protein (MSP) in circular form, instead of conventional linear form, has emerged. Covalently circularized nanodiscs have been shown to have improved stability, however the optimal strategies for the incorporation of membrane proteins, as well as the physicochemical properties of the membrane protein embedded in the cND, have not been studied. Bacteriorhodopsin (bR) is a seven-transmembrane helix (7TM) membrane protein, and it forms a two dimensional crystal consisting of trimeric bR on the purple membrane of halophilic archea. Here it is reported that the bR trimer in its active form can be directly incorporated into a cND from its native purple membrane. Furthermore, the assembly conditions of the native purple membrane nanodisc (PMND) were optimized to achieve homogeneity and high yield using a high sodium chloride concentration. Additionally, the native PMND was demonstrated to have the ability to assemble over a range of different pHs, suggesting flexibility in the preparation conditions. The native PMND was then found to not only preserve the trimeric structure of bR and most of the native lipids in the PM, but also maintained the photocycle function of bR. This suggests a promising potential for assembling a cND with a 7TM membrane protein, extracted directly from its native membrane environment, while preserving the protein conformation and lipid composition.","['1 Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences, Academia Sinica, 1, Sec. 4, Roosevelt Rd., Taipei, 10617, Taiwan.', '2 Department of Chemistry, National Taiwan University, 1, Sec. 4, Roosevelt Rd., Taipei, 10617, Taiwan.', '3 Department of Chemistry, National Tsing Hua University, 101, Sec. 2, Kuang-Fu Rd., Hsinchu, 30013, Taiwan.', '4 Institute of Physics, Academia Sinica, No.128, Sec. 2, Academia Rd., Taipei, 11529, Taiwan.', '5 Department of Chemistry, National Tsing Hua University, 101, Sec. 2, Kuang-Fu Rd., Hsinchu, 30013, Taiwan. lkchu@mx.nthu.edu.tw.', '6 Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences, Academia Sinica, 1, Sec. 4, Roosevelt Rd., Taipei, 10617, Taiwan. dharmanmr@gate.sinica.edu.tw.']","Vivien Yeh, Tsung-Yen Lee, Chung-Wen Chen, Pai-Chia Kuo, Jessie Shiue, Li-Kang Chu, Tsyr-Yan Yu, ",Scientific reports,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30201976

Among them, it is metabolomics that most accurately reflects the minor changes in body functioning, as it focuses on metabolome - the group of the metabolism products, both intermediate and end. Therefore, metabolomics is actively engaged in fundamental and clinical studies and search for potential biomarkers. The biomarker could be used in diagnostics, management and stratification of the patients, as well as in prognosing the outcomes. The good example is gynecology, since many gynecological diseases lack effective biomarkers. In the current review, we aimed to summarize the results of the studies, devoted to the search of potential metabolomic biomarkers for the most common gynecological diseases.","['1 Institute of Perinatology and Pediatric, Almazov National Medical Research Centre, Saint-Petersburg 197341, Russian Federation.', '2 International Research Centre ""Biotechnologies of the Third Millennium"", ITMO University, Saint-Petersburg 197341, Russian Federation.', '3 North-Western State Medical University named after I.I.

545,Protein Biomarkers in Major Depressive Disorder: An Update,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is common. Despite numerous available treatments, many individuals fail to improve clinically. Diagnosis of MDD continues to be commonly accomplished via behavioral rather than biological methods. Biomarkers may provide objective diagnosis of MDD, and could include measurements of genes, proteins, and patterns of brain activity. Proteomic analysis and validation of biomarkers is less explored than other areas of biomarker research in MDD. Mass spectrometry (MS) is a comprehensive, unbiased means of proteomic analysis, which can be complemented by directed protein measurements, such as Western Blotting. Prior studies have focused on MS analysis of several human biomaterials in MDD, including human post-mortem brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood components, and urine. Further studies utilizing MS and proteomic analysis in MDD may help solidify and establish biomarkers for use in diagnosis, identification of new treatment targets, and understanding of the disorder. A biomarker or a biomarker signature that facilitates a convenient and inexpensive predictive test for depression treatment response is highly desirable.","['1 Biochemistry & Proteomics Group, Department of Chemistry and Biomolecular Science, Clarkson University, Potsdam, NY, USA. awoods@clarkson.edu.', '2 Biochemistry & Proteomics Group, Department of Chemistry and Biomolecular Science, Clarkson University, Potsdam, NY, USA.', '3 Mood and Anxiety Disorders Program, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA.', '4 Nathan S.

546,Systematic Assessment of Burst Impurity in Confocal-Based Single-Molecule Fluorescence Detection Using Brownian Motion Simulations,"Single-molecule fluorescence detection (SMFD) experiments are useful in distinguishing sub-populations of molecular species when measuring heterogeneous samples. One experimental platform for SMFD is based on a confocal microscope, where molecules randomly traverse an effective detection volume. The non-uniformity of the excitation profile and the random nature of Brownian motion, produce fluctuating fluorescence signals. For these signals to be distinguished from the background, burst analysis is frequently used. Yet, the relation between the results of burst analyses and the underlying information of the diffusing molecules is still obscure and requires systematic assessment. In this work we performed three-dimensional Brownian motion simulations of SMFD, and tested the positions at which molecules emitted photons that passed the burst analysis criteria for different values of burst analysis parameters. The results of this work verify which of the burst analysis parameters and experimental conditions influence both the position of molecules in space when fluorescence is detected and taken into account, and whether these bursts of photons arise purely from single molecules, or not entirely. Finally, we show, as an example, the effect of bursts that are not purely from a single molecule on the accuracy in single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer measurements.","['1 Department of Biological Chemistry, The Alexander Silberman Institute of Life Sciences, Faculty of Mathematics & Science, The Edmond J.

Of the various materials that have been used to realize artificial synapses, renewable natural materials have the advantages of being abundant, inexpensive, biodegradable, and ecologically benign. In this study, we report a biocompatible artificial synapse based on a matrix of the biopolymer ι-carrageenan (ι-car), which exploits Ag dynamics. This artificial synapse emulates the short-term plasticity (STP), paired-pulse facilitation (PPF), and transition from STP to long-term potentiation (LTP) of a biological synapse. The above-mentioned characteristics are realized by exploiting the similarities between the Ag dynamics in the ι-car matrix and the Ca2+ dynamics in a biological synapse. By demonstrating a method that uses biomaterials and Ag dynamics to emulate synaptic functions, this study confirms that ι-car has the potential for constructing neuromorphic systems that use biocompatible artificial synapses.","['1 Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH) , Pohang 37673, Korea.', '2 Department of Materials Science and Engineering, The University of Texas at Dallas , Richardson, Texas 75080, United States.']","Min-Kyu Kim, Jang-Sik Lee, ",ACS nano,2018,artificial biosynapses; biocompatibility; ion dynamics; natural materials; solution processes.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29357225

551,Human Milk Lipidomics: Current Techniques and Methodologies,"Human milk contains a complex combination of lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, and minerals, which are essential for infant growth and development. While the lipid portion constitutes only 5% of the total human milk composition, it accounts for over 50% of the infant's daily energy intake. Human milk lipids vary throughout a feed, day, and through different stages of lactation, resulting in difficulties in sampling standardization and, like blood, human milk is bioactive containing endogenous lipases, therefore appropriate storage is critical in order to prevent lipolysis. Suitable sample preparation, often not described in studies, must also be chosen to achieve the aims of the study. Gas chromatography methods have classically been carried out to investigate the fatty acid composition of human milk lipids, but with the advancement of other chromatographic techniques, such as liquid and supercritical fluid chromatography, as well as mass spectrometry, intact lipids can also be characterized. Despite the known importance, concise and comprehensive analysis of the human milk lipidome is limited, with gaps existing in all areas of human milk lipidomics, discussed in this review. With appropriate methodology and instrumentation, further understanding of the human milk lipidome and the influence it has on infant outcomes can be achieved.","['1 School of Molecular Sciences, The University of Western Australia, Crawley, Perth, WA 6009, Australia. alexandra.george@research.uwa.edu.au.', '2 School of Molecular Sciences, The University of Western Australia, Crawley, Perth, WA 6009, Australia. melvin.gay@uwa.edu.au.', '3 Separation Science and Metabolomics Laboratory, Murdoch University, Murdoch, Perth, WA 6150, Australia.

Also, is possible to proclaim direct influence on the work by the European folklore surrounding the theologian, alchemist Johann Konrad Dippel and physician who habited the Frankenstein’s Castle from his birth, and further developing the “life elixir.” The similarities between the novel and the life of the three historical figures suggests that Mary Shelley, belonging to a socially graceful and educated class, was aware of the scientific dispute over the understanding of electricity.

553,Quantum-Limited Loss Sensing: Multiparameter Estimation and Bures Distance between Loss Channels,"The problem of estimating multiple loss parameters of an optical system using the most general ancilla-assisted parallel strategy is solved under energy constraints. An upper bound on the quantum Fisher information matrix is derived assuming that the environment modes involved in the loss interaction can be accessed. Any pure-state probe that is number diagonal in the modes interacting with the loss elements is shown to exactly achieve this upper bound even if the environment modes are inaccessible, as is usually the case in practice. We explain this surprising phenomenon, and show that measuring the Schmidt bases of the probe is a parameter-independent optimal measurement. Our results imply that multiple copies of two-mode squeezed vacuum probes with an arbitrarily small nonzero degree of squeezing, or probes prepared using single-photon states and linear optics, can achieve quantum-optimal performance in conjunction with on-off detection. We also calculate explicitly the energy-constrained Bures distance between any two product loss channels. Our results are relevant to standoff image sensing, biological imaging, absorption spectroscopy, and photodetector calibration.","['1 Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, 4 Engineering Drive 3, 117583 Singapore.']","Ranjith Nair, ",Physical review letters,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30576187
554,Computer-aided neurophysiology and imaging with open-source PhysImage,"Improved integration between imaging and electrophysiological data has become increasingly critical for rapid interpretation and intervention as approaches have advanced in recent years. Here, we present PhysImage, a fork of the popular public-domain ImageJ that provides a platform for working with these disparate sources of data, and we illustrate its utility using in vitro preparations from murine embryonic and neonatal tissue. PhysImage expands ImageJ's core features beyond an imaging program by facilitating integration, analyses, and display of 2D waveform data, among other new features. Together, with the Micro-Manager plugin for image acquisition, PhysImage substantially improves on closed-source or blended approaches to analyses and interpretation, and it furthermore aids post hoc automated analysis of physiological data when needed as we demonstrate here. Developing a high-throughput approach to neurophysiological analyses has been a major challenge for neurophysiology as a whole despite data analytics methods advancing rapidly in other areas of neuroscience, biology, and especially genomics. NEW & NOTEWORTHY High-throughput analyses of both concurrent electrophysiological and imaging recordings has been a major challenge in neurophysiology. We submit an open-source solution that may be able to alleviate, or at least reduce, many of these concerns by providing an institutionally proven mechanism (i.e., ImageJ) with the added benefits of open-source Python scripting of PhysImage data that eases the workmanship of 2D trace data, which includes electrophysiological data.

555,A novel approach to probabilistic characterisation of neural firing patterns,"Background:
      
    

    
      The advances in extracellular neural recording techniques result in big data volumes that necessitate fast, reliable, and automatic identification of statistically similar units. This study proposes a single framework yielding a compact set of probabilistic descriptors that characterise the firing patterns of a single unit. New method:
      
    

    
      Probabilistic features are estimated from an inter-spike-interval time series, without assumptions about the firing distribution or the stationarity. The first level of proposed firing patterns decomposition divides the inter-spike intervals into bursting, moderate and idle firing modes, yielding a coarse feature set. The second level identifies the successive bursting spikes, or the spiking acceleration/deceleration in the moderate firing mode, yielding a refined feature set. The features are estimated from simulated data and from experimental recordings from the lateral prefrontal cortex in awake, behaving rhesus monkeys. Results:
      
    

    
      An efficient and stable partitioning of neural units is provided by the ensemble evidence accumulation clustering. The possibility of selecting the number of clusters and choosing among coarse and refined feature sets provides an opportunity to explore and compare different data partitions. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The estimation of features, if applied to a single unit, can serve as a tool for the firing analysis, observing either overall spiking activity or the periods of interest in trial-to-trial recordings. If applied to massively parallel recordings, it additionally serves as an input to the clustering procedure, with the potential to compare the functional properties of various brain structures and to link the types of neural cells to the particular behavioural states.","['1 Faculty of Technical Sciences, University of Novi Sad, Trg Dositeja Obradovica, 21000 Novi Sad, Serbia.

Proteogenomics, a way to integrate genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics, have emerged as a way to understand molecular causes in cancer tumorigenesis. This understanding will help identify therapeutic targets that are urgently needed to improve individual patient outcomes. Areas covered: To explore underlying molecular mechanisms of lung cancer subtypes, several efforts have used proteogenomic approaches that integrate next generation sequencing (NGS) and mass spectrometry (MS)-based technologies. Expert opinion: A large-scale, MS-based, proteomic analysis, together with both NGS-based genomic data and clinicopathological information, will facilitate establishing extensive databases for lung cancer subtypes that can be used for further proteogenomic analyzes. Proteogenomic strategies will further be understanding of how major driver mutations affect downstream molecular networks, resulting in lung cancer progression and malignancy, and how therapy-resistant cancers resistant are molecularly structured. These strategies require advanced bioinformatics based on a dynamic theory of network systems, rather than statistics, to accurately identify mutant proteins and their affected key networks.","['1 Department of Translational Medicine Informatics, St. Marianna University School of Medicine , Kawasaki, Kanagawa , Japan.', '2 Department of Chest Surgery, St. Marianna University School of Medicine , Kawasaki, Kanagawa , Japan.', '3 Proteomics Biomedicum, Division of Physiological Chemistry I, Department of Medical Biochemistry & Biophysics (MBB), Karolinska Institutet , Solna , Sweden.', '4 Clinical Protein Science & Imaging, Biomedical Centre, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Lund University , Lund , Sweden.', '5 Section for Clinical Chemistry, Department of Translational Medicine, Lund University, Skåne University Hospital Malmö , Malmö , Sweden.', '6 Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Respiratory Medicine, St. Marianna University School of Medicine , Kawasaki , Kanagawa , Japan.']","Toshihide Nishimura, Haruhiko Nakamura, Ákos Végvári, György Marko-Varga, Naoki Furuya, Hisashi Saji, ",Expert review of proteomics,2019 Sep,Lung cancer; clinical proteogenomics; mutant identification; network-based bioinformatics; next generation sequencing; proteomics⋅mass; spectrometry.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31402712
557,Hollow-Core-Photonic-Crystal-Fiber-Based Miniaturized Sensor for the Detection of Aggregation-Induced-Emission Molecules,"A miniature sensor for detection of aggregation-induced-emission (AIE) molecules is proposed in this work. The sensing head is fabricated by use of hollow-core photonic crystal fiber with a core diameter of about 4.8 μm. The cladding holes are sealed with a fusion splicing technique, and the central hole remains open to allow the filtration of solution with AIE molecules. When the solution is excited by an ultraviolet lamp, the fluorescence is received by a fiber-optic spectrometer. The fluorescence intensity is associated with the concentration of AIE molecules and the infiltrated-core length. In the whole process of the experiments, the output-peak wavelength is stable, which indicates that the existing forms of AIE particles are stable, and the fluorescence reabsorption can be neglected. The experimental results obtained are in accordance with traditional microplate-spectrophotometer methods. The most exciting result is that the amount of sample measured can be as low as 0.36 nL, which allows the detection of AIE molecules at only 0.02 pmol. In addition, the miniature sensor was successfully applied to the detection of an AIE-based bioprobe for evaluating the activity of the dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor sitagliptin with an IC50 of 59.80 ± 3.06 nM. The advantages of small device size and nanoliter-scale sample volumes suggest that the proposed sensor is promising for many biosensing applications.","['1 College of Optical and Electronic Technology , China Jiliang University , Hangzhou , Zhejiang 310018 , China.', '2 State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks , Shanghai Jiaotong University , Shanghai 200000 , China.', '3 College of Pharmaceutical Sciences , Zhejiang University , Hangzhou , Zhejiang 310058 , China.']","H F Chen, Q J Jiang, Y Q Qiu, X C Chen, B Fan, Y Wang, D N Wang, ",Analytical chemistry,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30475594

Among these, the clear majority have been performed on dissociated primary cells. To improve our understanding of how teleost pituitary cells, behave in a more biologically relevant environment, this protocol shows how to prepare viable brain-pituitary slices using the small freshwater fish medaka (Oryzias latipes). Making the brain-pituitary slices, pH and osmolality of all solutions were adjusted to values found in body fluids of freshwater fish living at 25 to 28 °C. Following slice preparation, the protocol demonstrates how to conduct electrophysiological recordings using the perforated whole-cell patch-clamp technique. The patch-clamp technique is a powerful tool with unprecedented temporal resolution and sensitivity, allowing investigation of electrical properties from intact whole cells down to single ion channels. Perforated patch is unique in that it keeps the intracellular environment intact preventing regulatory elements in the cytosol from being diluted by the patch pipette electrode solution. In contrast, when performing traditional whole-cell recordings, it was observed that medaka pituitary cells quickly lose their ability to fire action potentials. Among the various perforation techniques available, this protocol demonstrates how to achieve perforation of the patched membrane using the fungicide Amphotericin B.","['1 Department of Basic Sciences and Aquatic Medicine, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Norwegian University of Life Sciences.', '2 Department of Basic Sciences and Aquatic Medicine, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Norwegian University of Life Sciences; finn-arne.weltzien@nmbu.no.']","Romain Fontaine, Kjetil Hodne, Finn-Arne Weltzien, ",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30176004
559,Dose to water versus dose to medium from cavity theory applied to small animal irradiation with kilovolt x-rays,"Dose reporting is a matter of concern in the preclinical field as the different dose descriptors dose-to-water-in-medium [Formula: see text] and dose-to-medium-in-medium [Formula: see text] coexist. For kV photons differences between both quantities are expected to be amplified due to photon energy absorption coefficients differences for different media, and could represent a limiting factor for accurate translation of pre-clinical research into clinical trials. The main goal of this study was to analyse the relationship between [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] for kV irradiation of small animals, using different flavours of the intermediate cavity theory (ICT). Irradiations of mathematical phantoms and a mouse CT scan, both with different voxel sizes and materials, were investigated. A modified version of the Monte Carlo code DOSXYZnrc was used to derive [Formula: see text] and convert to [Formula: see text] using ICT. Local photon spectra were generated in different regions of the mouse. Depending on energy and cavity size, which we equate to the voxel size, [Formula: see text] ranged from 0.68 to 4.37 times [Formula: see text]. Higher kV energy combined with very small cavity sizes yielded decreased [Formula: see text] in comparison to [Formula: see text]; this behaviour was reversed for larger cavities combined with lower kV energies. Hence, the impact of the cavity dimensions on estimated [Formula: see text] is significant on pre-clinical kV beams. [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] in the ex vivo male mouse were found to differ by -29% to 286%. Caution is advised when using the ICT due to a lack of consensus on weighting factor (d-parameter) deriving methods; for the same irradiation conditions, different d-values affected [Formula: see text] up to 20%. Pre-clinically, such divergence between dose descriptors could enable biological damage. The abiding debate over which quantity to favour is foreseen to linger while it is unclear which quantity correlates better with the biological effects of ionizing irradiation: preclinical radiotherapy might represent an ideal platform for measurement-based studies to settle this fundamental question. Finally, dose distribution comparisons require caution and should use the same reporting quantity.","['1 Department of Radiation Oncology (MAASTRO), GROW-School for Oncology and Developmental Biology, Maastricht University Medical Centre, Maastricht, The Netherlands.']","Ana Vaniqui, Blake R Walters, Gabriel P Fonseca, Frank Verhaegen, ",Physics in medicine and biology,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31252419

561,A Canonical Biophysical Model of the CsrA Global Regulator Suggests Flexible Regulator-Target Interactions,"Bacterial global post-transcriptional regulators execute hundreds of interactions with targets that display varying molecular features while retaining specificity. Herein, we develop, validate, and apply a biophysical, statistical thermodynamic model of canonical target mRNA interactions with the CsrA global post-transcriptional regulator to understand the molecular features that contribute to target regulation. Altogether, we model interactions of CsrA with a pool of 236 mRNA: 107 are experimentally regulated by CsrA and 129 are suspected interaction partners. Guided by current understanding of CsrA-mRNA interactions, we incorporate (i) mRNA nucleotide sequence, (ii) cooperativity of CsrA-mRNA binding, and (iii) minimization of mRNA structural changes to identify an ensemble of likely binding sites and their free energies. The regulatory impact of bound CsrA on mRNA translation is determined with the RBS calculator. Predicted regulation of 66 experimentally regulated mRNAs adheres to the principles of canonical CsrA-mRNA interactions; the remainder implies that other, diverse mechanisms may underlie CsrA-mRNA interaction and regulation. Importantly, results suggest that this global regulator may bind targets in multiple conformations, via flexible stretches of overlapping predicted binding sites. This novel observation expands the notion that CsrA always binds to its targets at specific consensus sequences.","['1 McKetta Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Texas at Austin, 200 E.

562,An adaptive hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin approach for cardiac electrophysiology,"Cardiac electrophysiology simulations are numerically challenging because of the propagation of a steep electrochemical wave front and thus require discretizations with small mesh sizes to obtain accurate results. In this work, we present an approach based on the hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin method (HDG), which allows an efficient implementation of high-order discretizations into a computational framework. In particular, using the advantage of the discontinuous function space, we present an efficient p-adaptive strategy for accurately tracking the wave front. The HDG allows to reduce the overall degrees of freedom in the final linear system to those only on the element interfaces. Additionally, we propose a rule for a suitable integration accuracy for the ionic current term depending on the polynomial order and the cell model to handle high-order polynomials. Our results show that for the same number of degrees of freedom, coarse high-order elements provide more accurate results than fine low-order elements. Introducing p-adaptivity further reduces computational costs while maintaining accuracy by restricting the use of high-order elements to resolve the wave front. For a patient-specific simulation of a cardiac cycle, p-adaptivity reduces the average number of degrees of freedom by 95% compared to the nonadaptive model. In addition to reducing computational costs, using coarse meshes with our p-adaptive high-order HDG method also simplifies practical aspects of mesh generation and postprocessing.","['1 Institute for Computational Mechanics, Technical University Munich, Boltzmannstr 15, Garching b.

563,A guide to ancient protein studies,"Palaeoproteomics is an emerging neologism used to describe the application of mass spectrometry-based approaches to the study of ancient proteomes. As with palaeogenomics (the study of ancient DNA), it intersects evolutionary biology, archaeology and anthropology, with applications ranging from the phylogenetic reconstruction of extinct species to the investigation of past human diets and ancient diseases. However, there is no explicit consensus at present regarding standards for data reporting, data validation measures or the use of suitable contamination controls in ancient protein studies. Additionally, in contrast to the ancient DNA community, no consolidated guidelines have been proposed by which researchers, reviewers and editors can evaluate palaeoproteomics data, in part due to the novelty of the field. Here we present a series of precautions and standards for ancient protein research that can be implemented at each stage of analysis, from sample selection to data interpretation. These guidelines are not intended to impose a narrow or rigid list of authentication criteria, but rather to support good practices in the field and to ensure the generation of robust, reproducible results. As the field grows and methodologies change, so too will best practices. It is therefore essential that researchers continue to provide necessary details on how data were generated and authenticated so that the results can be independently and effectively evaluated. We hope that these proposed standards of practice will help to provide a firm foundation for the establishment of palaeoproteomics as a viable and powerful tool for archaeologists, anthropologists and evolutionary biologists.","['1 Department of Archaeology, Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, Jena, Germany. hendy@shh.mpg.de.', '2 Department of Human Evolution, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig, Germany. frido_welker@eva.mpg.de.', '3 Natural History Museum of Denmark, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark. frido_welker@eva.mpg.de.', '4 Department of Life Science and Systems Biology, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', '5 BioArCh, Department of Archaeology, University of York, York, UK.', '6 Department of Archaeogenetics, Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, Jena, Germany.', '7 Department of Anthropology, University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK, USA.', '8 Institute for Evolutionary Medicine, University of Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland.', '9 Natural History Museum of Denmark, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.']","Jessica Hendy, Frido Welker, Beatrice Demarchi, Camilla Speller, Christina Warinner, Matthew J Collins, ",Nature ecology & evolution,2018 May,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29581591
564,Rapid Diagnosis of Tick-Borne Illnesses by Use of One-Step Isothermal Nucleic Acid Amplification and Bio-Optical Sensor Detection,"Background:
      
    

    
      Scrub typhus and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) are the most common tick-borne illnesses in South Korea. Early differentiation of SFTS from scrub typhus in emergency departments is essential but difficult because of their overlapping epidemiology, shared risk factors, and similar clinical manifestations. Methods:
      
    

    
      We compared the diagnostic performance of one-step isothermal nucleic acid amplification with bio-optical sensor detection (iNAD) under isothermal conditions, which is rapid (20-30 min), with that of real-time PCR, in patients with a confirmed tick-borne illness. Fifteen patients with confirmed SFTS who provided a total of 15 initial blood samples and 5 follow-up blood samples, and 21 patients with confirmed scrub typhus, were evaluated. Results:
      
    

    
      The clinical sensitivity of iNAD (100%; 95% CI, 83-100) for SFTS was significantly higher than that of real-time PCR (75%; 95% CI, 51-91; P = 0.047), while its clinical specificity (86%; 95% CI, 65-97) was similar to that of real-time PCR (95%; 95% CI, 77-99; P = 0.61). The clinical sensitivity of iNAD for scrub typhus (100%; 95% CI, 81-100) was significantly higher than that of real-time PCR for scrub typhus (67%; 95% CI, 43-85; P = 0.009), while its clinical specificity (90%; 95% CI, 67-98) was similar to that of real-time PCR (95%; 95% CI, 73-100; P > 0.99). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      iNAD is a valuable, rapid method of detecting SFTS virus and Orientia tsutsugamushi with high clinical sensitivity and specificity.","['1 Departments of Infectious Diseases, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', '2 Convergence Medicine, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', '3 Convergence Medicine, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea. kimsunghanmd@hotmail.com shinyongno1@gmail.com.', '4 Departments of Infectious Diseases, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea; kimsunghanmd@hotmail.com shinyongno1@gmail.com.']","Ji Yeun Kim, Bonhan Koo, Choong Eun Jin, Min Chul Kim, Yong Pil Chong, Sang-Oh Lee, Sang-Ho Choi, Yang Soo Kim, Jun Hee Woo, Yong Shin, Sung-Han Kim, ",Clinical chemistry,2018 Mar,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29208659

566,The Experimental Study of Bacterial Evolution and Its Implications for the Modern Synthesis of Evolutionary Biology,"Since the 1940s, microbiologists, biochemists and population geneticists have experimented with the genetic mechanisms of microorganisms in order to investigate evolutionary processes. These evolutionary studies of bacteria and other microorganisms gained some recognition from the standard-bearers of the modern synthesis of evolutionary biology, especially Theodosius Dobzhansky and Ledyard Stebbins. A further period of post-synthesis bacterial evolutionary research occurred between the 1950s and 1980s. These experimental analyses focused on the evolution of population and genetic structure, the adaptive gain of new functions, and the evolutionary consequences of competition dynamics. This large body of research aimed to make evolutionary theory testable and predictive, by giving it mechanistic underpinnings. Although evolutionary microbiologists promoted bacterial experiments as methodologically advantageous and a source of general insight into evolution, they also acknowledged the biological differences of bacteria. My historical overview concludes with reflections on what bacterial evolutionary research achieved in this period, and its implications for the still-developing modern synthesis.","['1 UMR 5164, University of Bordeaux, 33076, Bordeaux, France. maureen.omalley@u-bordeaux.fr.']","Maureen A O'Malley, ",Journal of the history of biology,2018 Jun,Bacterial population biology; Evolutionary biology; Microbial experimental evolution; Modern synthesis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28980196

568,Rational Design of Semiconductor Nanostructures for Functional Subcellular Interfaces,"One of the fundamental questions guiding research in the biological sciences is how cellular systems process complex physical and environmental cues and communicate with each other across multiple length scales. Importantly, aberrant signal processing in these systems can lead to diseases that can have devastating impacts on human lives. Biophysical studies in the past several decades have demonstrated that cells can respond to not only biochemical cues but also mechanical and electrical ones. Thus, the development of new materials that can both sense and modulate all of these pathways is necessary. Semiconducting nanostructures are an emerging class of discovery platforms and tools that can push the limits of our ability to modulate and sense biological behaviors for both fundamental research and clinical applications. These materials are of particular interest for interfacing with cellular systems due to their matched dimension with subcellular components (e.g., cytoskeletal filaments), and easily tunable properties in the electrical, optical and mechanical regimes. Rational design via traditional or new approaches, such as nanocasting and mesoscale chemical lithography, can allow us to control micro- and nanoscale features in nanowires to achieve new biointerfaces. Both processes endogenous to the target cell and properties of the material surface dictate the character of these interfaces. In this Account, we focus on (1) approaches for the rational design of semiconducting nanowires that exhibit unique structures for biointerfaces, (2) recent fundamental discoveries that yield robust biointerfaces at the subcellular level, (3) intracellular electrical and mechanical sensing, and (4) modulation of cellular behaviors through material topography and remote physical stimuli. In the first section, we discuss new approaches for the synthetic control of micro- and nanoscale features of these materials. In the second section, we focus on achieving biointerfaces with these rationally designed materials either intra- or extracellularly. We last delve into the use of these materials in sensing mechanical forces and electrical signals in various cellular systems as well as in instructing cellular behaviors. Future research in this area may shift the paradigm in fundamental biophysical research and biomedical applications through (1) the design and synthesis of new semiconductor-based materials and devices that interact specifically with targeted cells, (2) the clarification of many developmental, physiological, and anatomical aspects of cellular communications, (3) an understanding of how signaling between cells regulates synaptic development (e.g., information like this would offer new insight into how the nervous system works and provide new targets for the treatment of neurological diseases), (4) and the creation of new cellular materials that have the potential to open up completely new areas of application, such as in hybrid information processing systems.","['1 The Graduate Program in Biophysical Sciences , The University of Chicago , Chicago , Illinois 60637 , United States.', '2 Medical Scientist Training Program , The University of Chicago , Chicago , Illinois 60637 , United States.', '3 Department of Chemistry , The University of Chicago , Chicago , Illinois 60637 , United States.', '4 The James Franck Institute , The University of Chicago , Chicago , Illinois 60637 , United States.', '5 The Institute for Biophysical Dynamics , The University of Chicago , Chicago , Illinois 60637 , United States.']","Ramya Parameswaran, Bozhi Tian, ",Accounts of chemical research,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29668260
569,Quantification of global lung inflammation using volumetric 18F-FDG PET/CT parameters in locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer patients treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy: a comparison of photon and proton radiation therapy,"Introduction:
      
    

    
      Radiation pneumonitis is a major dose-limiting complication in thoracic radiation therapy (RT) and presents clinically in the first few months after RT. We evaluated the feasibility of quantifying pulmonary parenchymal glycolysis (PG) as a surrogate of global lung inflammation and radiation-induced pulmonary toxicity using a novel semiautomatic lung segmentation technique in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and compared PG in patients treated with photon or proton RT. Patients and methods:
      
    

    
      We evaluated 18 consecutive locally advanced NSCLC patients who underwent pretreatment and post-treatment F-FDG PET/CT treated with definitive (median: 66.6 Gy; 1.8 Gy fractions) photon or proton RT between 2010 and 2014. Lung volume segmentation was conducted using 3D Slicer by performing simple thresholding. Pulmonary PG was calculated by summing F-FDG uptake in the whole lung. Results:
      
    

    
      In nine patients treated with photon RT, significant increases in PG in both ipsilateral (mean difference: 1400±510; P=0.02) and contralateral (mean difference: 1200±450; P=0.03) lungs were noted. In nine patients treated with proton therapy, no increase in pulmonary PG was observed in either the ipsilateral (P=0.30) or contralateral lung (P=0.98). Conclusion:
      
    

    
      We observed a significant increase in global lung inflammation bilaterally as measured by quantification of PG. However, no significant change in global lung inflammation was noted after proton therapy. Future larger studies are needed to determine whether this difference correlates with lower risks of radiation pneumonitis in NSCLC patients treated with proton therapy.","['1 Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Maryland Medical Center.', '2 Department of Radiology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', '3 Department of Radiation Oncology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California.', '4 Department of Radiation Oncology, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', '5 Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.']","Stephanie R Rice, Babak Saboury, Sina Houshmand, Ali Salavati, Anusha Kalbasi, Chelain R Goodman, Thomas J Werner, Zeljko Vujaskovic, Charles B Simone 2nd, Abass Alavi, ",Nuclear medicine communications,2019 Jun,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31095527
570,Multimodal Characterization of Neural Networks Using Highly Transparent Electrode Arrays,"Transparent and flexible materials are attractive for a wide range of emerging bioelectronic applications. These include neural interfacing devices for both recording and stimulation, where low electrochemical electrode impedance is valuable. Here the conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is used to fabricate electrodes that are small enough to allow unencumbered optical access for imaging a large cell population with two-photon (2P) microscopy, yet provide low impedance for simultaneous high quality recordings of neural activity in vivo. To demonstrate this, pathophysiological activity was induced in the mouse cortex using 4-aminopyridine (4AP), and the resulting electrical activity was detected with the PEDOT:PSS-based probe while imaging calcium activity directly below the probe area. The induced calcium activity of the neuronal network as measured by the fluorescence change in the cells correlated well with the electrophysiological recordings from the cortical grid of PEDOT:PSS microelectrodes. Our approach provides a valuable vehicle for complementing classical high temporal resolution electrophysiological analysis with optical imaging.","['1 Department of Bioelectronics, Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Mines, Centre of Microelectronics in Provence, Gardanne 13541, France.', '2 Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, INT, Inst Neurosci Timone, Marseille, France.', '3 Department of Psychiatry, Division of Systems Neuroscience, Columbia University and Research Foundation for Mental Hygiene, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY 10032.', '4 Laboratory of 3D Functional Network and Dendritic Imaging, Institute of Experimental Medicine, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Budapest H-1083, Hungary.', '5 Aix Marseille Univ, INSERM, INS, Inst Neurosci Syst, Marseille, France.', '6 Neuroengineering Research Group, Interdisciplinary Excellence Center, Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunobiology, University of Szeged, Szeged 6720, Hungary.', '7 Two-Photon Measurement Technology Research Group, Pázmány Péter Catholic University, Budapest H-1083, Hungary.', '8 Electrical Engineering Division, Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB3 0FA, United Kingdom.']","Mary J Donahue, Attila Kaszas, Gergely F Turi, Balázs Rózsa, Andrea Slézia, Ivo Vanzetta, Gergely Katona, Christophe Bernard, George G Malliaras, Adam Williamson, ",eNeuro,2018,PEDOT:PSS; electrophysiology; neuroengineering; organic electronics; transparent electronics; two-photon imaging.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30783610

573,Anticipated learning outcomes for a biochemistry course-based undergraduate research experience aimed at predicting protein function from structure: Implications for assessment design,"Several course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) have been published in the literature. However, only limited attempts have been made to rigorously identify the discovery-type research abilities that students actually develop during such experiences. Instead, there has been a greater focus on technical or procedural-type knowledge or general CURE skills that are too comprehensive to effectively assess. Before the extent of discovery-type learning outcomes can be established in students (termed verified learning outcomes or VLOs), it is important to rigorously identify the anticipated learning outcomes (ALOs) and to then develop student assessments that target each ALO to reveal the nature of such student learning. In this article we present a matrix of 43 ALOs, or course-based undergraduate research abilities (CURAs), that instructors anticipate students will develop during a recently-developed biochemistry CURE focusing on the prediction of protein function from structure. The CURAs were identified using the process for identifying course-based undergraduate research abilities (PICURA) and classified into seven distinct themes that enabled the characterization of the CURE and a comparison to other published inventories of research competencies and CURE aspects. These themes and the CURE protocols aligning to the CURAs were used to form the ALO matrix that was, in turn, used to inform the design of an assessment that revealed evidence that a student had developed some of the targeted CURAs. Future research will focus on further assessment development that targets other identified CURAs. This approach has potential applications to other CUREs both in biochemistry and other science disciplines. © 2018 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 46(5):478-492, 2018.","['1 Department of Chemistry, Purdue University, West Lafayette.', '2 Department of Biological Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette.']","Stefan M Irby, Nancy J Pelaez, Trevor R Anderson, ",Biochemistry and molecular biology education : a bimonthly publication of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,2018 Sep,Course-based undergraduate research experience; anticipated learning outcomes; assessment and the design of probes for student understanding and learning; biochemistry laboratory; bioinformatics; enzymes and catalysis; genomics proteomics; inquiry based teaching; integration of research into undergraduate teaching; predicting protein function from structure; student learning.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30369040
574,"On calculating kerma, collision kerma and radiative yields","Purpose:
      
    

    
      To study the relationships between dose (D), kerma (K), and collision kerma ( K col  ) in photon beams and to investigate total radiative yields for electrons and positrons as a function of energy. To do this accurately required calculating collision kerma directly as a function of position in a phantom and making changes to the EGSnrc package (including DOSRZnrc and g applications). Methods:
      
    

    
      Changes were made to the EGSnrc system to allow the user to distinguish events according to their initiating process, most importantly relaxation particles initiated by electron impact ionization as opposed to initiated by photons, especially those events depositing energy below energy cutoffs after relaxation events. Appropriate changes were made to the applications DOSRZnrc and g and a new application, DOSRZnrcKcol, was written. Results:
      
    

    
      The modified codes are much more robust against changes in simulation parameters such as ECUT and AE and whether or not electron impact ionization is included in the simulation. The radiative yields for electrons generally differ from values in ICRU Report 371 (1984) which only account for radiative losses due to bremsstrahlung. The Monte Carlo calculated g(brems) values are generally greater than the ICRU 37 values due to energy-loss straggling. Plots of D, K and K col  vs depth in megavoltage photon beams show that some ""conventional wisdom"" does not hold in general (e.g., D is not always greater than K past D max  ) and in general at 10 cm depth it is found that D≈K and D > K col   . The beam radius at which D / K col   reaches its saturation value depends strongly on the threshold used to define reaching saturation and is generally greater than the radius for lateral charged particle equilibrium used in the TRS-483 Code of Practice for small beam dosimetry2 (Palmans et al, Med Phys. 2018;45:e1123-e1145). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The changes to EGSnrc make kerma calculations more accurate but previous calculations with electron impact ionization turned off gave close to correct results. The application DOSRZnrcKcol makes calculating collision kerma more efficient and avoids various approximations used in the past although those approximations are shown to be justified. Including energy-loss straggling when calculating bremsstrahlung radiation yield increases the value. Fluorescence losses and annihilation in flight further increase the radiation yield of electrons and positrons. Results demonstrate the effects of EGSnrc using electron bremsstrahlung production cross sections for positrons and failing to model positron impact ionization.","['1 Carleton Laboratory for Radiotherapy Physics, Physics Department, Carleton University, Ottawa, K1S 5B6, Canada.', '2 Metrology Research Centre, National Research Council Canada, Ottawa, K1A OR6, Canada.']","D W O Rogers, Reid W Townson, ",Medical physics,2019 Nov,EGSnrc; Monte Carlo; collision kerma; electron impact ionization; kerma; radiative yield.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31361030

In vivo reconstitution and biosynthetic studies of natural product gene clusters encoding these enzymes are often severely limited by ineffective heterologous expression hosts, including the otherwise versatile Escherichia coli. In this chapter, we describe the use of rhizobia bacteria as effective expression hosts for cobalamin-dependent rSAM C-methyltransferases. We chose the natural product pathway encoding the heavily modified cytotoxic peptides, the polytheonamides, as our model pathway due to the presence of two methyltransferases responsible for a total of 17 C-methylations. Detailed protocols are given for vector construction, transformation, and heterologous expression in Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae 3841. Additional methods pertaining to analytical separation and mass spectrometric analysis of modified peptides are also entailed. As genomics continues to uncover new enzymes and pathways from unknown and uncultivated microbes, use of metabolically distinct heterologous expression hosts like rhizobia will be a necessary tool to unravel the catalytic and metabolic diversity of marine microbial life.","['1 Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, and Biophysics & BioTechnology Institute, University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, St. Paul, MN, United States.

579,Evaluation of Food Fineness by the Bionic Tongue Distributed Mechanical Testing Device,"In this study, to obtain a texture perception that is closer to the human sense, we designed eight bionic tongue indenters based on the law of the physiology of mandibular movements and tongue movements features, set up a bionic tongue distributed mechanical testing device, performed in vitro simulations to obtain the distributed mechanical information over the tongue surface, and preliminarily constructed a food fineness perception evaluation model. By capturing a large number of tongue movements during chewing, we analyzed and simulated four representative tongue movement states including the tiled state, sunken state, raised state, and overturned state of the tongue. By analyzing curvature parameters and the Gauss curvature of the tongue surface, we selected the regional circle of interest. With that, eight bionic tongue indenters with different curvatures over the tongue surface were designed. Together with an arrayed film pressure sensor, we set up a bionic tongue distributed mechanical testing device, which was used to do contact pressure experiments on three kinds of cookies-WZ Cookie, ZL Cookie and JSL Cookie-with different fineness texture characteristics. Based on the distributed mechanical information perceived by the surface of the bionic tongue indenter, we established a food fineness perception evaluation model by defining three indicators, including gradient, stress change rate and areal density. The correlation between the sensory assessment and model result was analyzed. The results showed that the average values of correlation coefficients among the three kinds of food with the eight bionic tongue indenters reached 0.887, 0.865, and 0.870, respectively, that is, a significant correlation was achieved. The results illustrate that the food fineness perception evaluation model is effective, and the bionic tongue distributed mechanical testing device has a good practical significance for obtaining food texture mouthfeel information.","['1 College of Automation Engineering, Northeast Electric Power University, Jilin 132012, China. jingjing_liu@neepu.edu.cn.', '2 Department of Computer Science and Bioimaging Research Center, University of Georgia, Athens, GA 30602, USA. jingjing_liu@neepu.edu.cn.', '3 College of Automation Engineering, Northeast Electric Power University, Jilin 132012, China. 2201600406@neepu.edu.cn.', '4 Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697, USA. yizhouc1@uci.edu.', '5 College of Automation Engineering, Northeast Electric Power University, Jilin 132012, China. w_wei110@163.com.', '6 College of Automation Engineering, Northeast Electric Power University, Jilin 132012, China. tyying1213@sina.com.', '7 College of Automation Engineering, Northeast Electric Power University, Jilin 132012, China. menhong@neepu.edu.cn.']","Jingjing Liu, Ying Cui, Yizhou Chen, Wei Wang, Yuanyuan Tang, Hong Men, ","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2018,arrayed film pressure sensor; bionic tongue indenter; curvature difference; fineness perception evaluation model; sensory assessment; texture perception.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30513979

Diffusion in B is described by the subdiffusion-absorption equation with a fractional time derivative. Solutions to equations are obtained for a specific boundary condition at the border between media.

582,Neuromodulation of Axon Terminals,"Understanding which cellular compartments are influenced during neuromodulation underpins any rational effort to explain and optimize outcomes. Axon terminals have long been speculated to be sensitive to polarization, but experimentally informed models for CNS stimulation are lacking. We conducted simultaneous intracellular recording from the neuron soma and axon terminal (blebs) during extracellular stimulation with weak sustained (DC) uniform electric fields in mouse cortical slices. Use of weak direct current stimulation (DCS) allowed isolation and quantification of changes in axon terminal biophysics, relevant to both suprathreshold (e.g., deep brain stimulation, spinal cord stimulation, and transcranial magnetic stimulation) and subthreshold (e.g., transcranial DCS and transcranial alternating current stimulation) neuromodulation approaches. Axon terminals polarized with sensitivity (mV of membrane polarization per V/m electric field) 4 times than somas. Even weak polarization (<2 mV) of axon terminals significantly changes action potential dynamics (including amplitude, duration, conduction velocity) in response to an intracellular pulse. Regarding a cellular theory of neuromodulation, we explain how suprathreshold CNS stimulation activates the action potential at terminals while subthreshold approaches modulate synaptic efficacy through axon terminal polarization. We demonstrate that by virtue of axon polarization and resulting changes in action potential dynamics, neuromodulation can influence analog-digital information processing.","['1 Sagol Department of Neurobiology, University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel.', '2 Department of Biomedical Engineering, The City College of New York of CUNY, New York, NY, USA.']","Darpan Chakraborty, Dennis Q Truong, Marom Bikson, Hanoch Kaphzan, ","Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)",2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28655149
583,Biophysically realistic neuron models for simulation of cortical stimulation,"Objective:
      
    

    
      We implemented computational models of human and rat cortical neurons for simulating the neural response to cortical stimulation with electromagnetic fields. Approach:
      
    

    
      We adapted model neurons from the library of Blue Brain models to reflect biophysical and geometric properties of both adult rat and human cortical neurons and coupled the model neurons to exogenous electric fields (E-fields). The models included 3D reconstructed axonal and dendritic arbors, experimentally-validated electrophysiological behaviors, and multiple, morphological variants within cell types. Using these models, we characterized the single-cell responses to intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) and uniform E-field with dc as well as pulsed currents. Main results:
      
    

    
      The strength-duration and current-distance characteristics of the model neurons to ICMS agreed with published experimental results, as did the subthreshold polarization of cell bodies and axon terminals by uniform dc E-fields. For all forms of stimulation, the lowest threshold elements were terminals of the axon collaterals, and the dependence of threshold and polarization on spatial and temporal stimulation parameters was strongly affected by morphological features of the axonal arbor, including myelination, diameter, and branching. Significance:
      
    

    
      These results provide key insights into the mechanisms of cortical stimulation. The presented models can be used to study various cortical stimulation modalities while incorporating detailed spatial and temporal features of the applied E-field.","['1 Department of Biomedical Engineering, School of Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, United States of America.']","Aman S Aberra, Angel V Peterchev, Warren M Grill, ",Journal of neural engineering,2018 Dec,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30127100

585,Promoting mastery of complex biological mechanisms,"This article describes efforts aimed at improving comprehension and retention of complex molecular mechanisms commonly studied in undergraduate biology and biochemistry courses. The focus is on the design of appropriate assessments, an active classroom emphasizing formative practice, and more effective out-of-class study habits. Assessments that require students to articulate their understanding through writing are the most effective. Frequent formative practice improves performance on problems that require intellectual transfer, the ability to apply conceptual principles in novel settings. We show that success with such problems is a function of mastery of the intrinsic logic of the biology in play, not variations in the way they are written. Survey data demonstrate that many students would prefer a learning style not dominated by memorization of factual details, but how to develop a more effective strategy is rarely intuitive. Matching individual students with specific learning styles has not proven useful. Instead, teachers can strongly promote individual metacognitive appraisal during both classroom activities and other study environments. © 2017 by The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 46(1):7-21, 2018.","['1 Department of Microbiology and Molecular Biology, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, 84602.', '2 Department of Biology, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, 84602.', '3 Department of Physiology and Developmental Biology, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, 84602.']","William S Bradshaw, Kathryn J Groneman, Jennifer Nelson, John D Bell, ",Biochemistry and molecular biology education : a bimonthly publication of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,2018 Jan,cell biology; complex concepts; learning styles; metacognition; transfer; undergraduate.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28902439
586,Biophysical basis of the linear electrical receptive fields of retinal ganglion cells,"Responses of retinal ganglion cells to direct electrical stimulation have been shown experimentally to be well described by linear-nonlinear models. These models rely on the simplifying assumption that retinal ganglion cell responses to stimulation with an array of electrodes are driven by a simple linear weighted sum of stimulus current amplitudes from each electrode, known as the 'electrical receptive field'. Objective:
      
    

    
      This paper aims to demonstrate the biophysical basis of the linear-nonlinear model and the electrical receptive field to facilitate the development of improved stimulation strategies for retinal implants. Approach:
      
    

    
      We compare the linear-nonlinear model of subretinal electrical stimulation with a multi-layered, biophysical, volume conductor model of retinal stimulation. Main results:
      
    

    
      Our results show that the linear electrical receptive field of the linear-nonlinear model matches the transmembrane currents induced by electrodes (the activating function) at the site of the high-density sodium channel band with only minor discrepancies. The discrepancies are mostly eliminated by including axial current flow originating from adjacent cell compartments. Furthermore, for cells where a single linear electrical receptive field is insufficient, we show that cell responses are likely driven by multiple sites of action potential initiation with multiple distinct receptive fields, each of which can be accurately described by the activating function. Significance:
      
    

    
      This result establishes that the biophysical basis of the electrical receptive field of the linear-nonlinear model is the superposition of transmembrane currents induced by different electrodes at and near the site of action potential initiation. Together with existing experimental support for linear-nonlinear models of electrical stimulation, this provides a firm basis for using this much simplified model to generate more optimal stimulation patterns for retinal implants.","['1 NeuroEngineering Laboratory, Department of Biomedical Engineering, The University of Melbourne, Australia.']","Timothy B Esler, Matias I Maturana, Robert R Kerr, David B Grayden, Anthony N Burkitt, Hamish Meffin, ",Journal of neural engineering,2018 Oct,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29889051
587,A split-range acquisition method for the non-targeted metabolomic profiling of human plasma with hydrophilic interaction chromatography - high-resolution mass spectrometry,"Untargeted metabolomics of human plasma with mass spectrometry is of particular interest in medical research to explore pathophysiology, find disease biomarkers or for the understanding of the response to pharmacotherapy. Since analytical performances may be impacted by the laboratory environment and the acquisition method settings, the objectives of this study were to assess the role of interfering compounds and to propose an acquisition method to maximize the metabolome coverage for human plasma metabolomic analysis. Human plasma samples were processed with liquid/liquid extraction then analysed with HILIC-high resolution mass spectrometry. A method with a single m/z range was compared to four methods with different split acquisition ranges and four sets of ionization source parameters were compared. The data were analysed with the R software and on the Worklow4Metabolomics online platform. The major interfering compounds were identified in blank samples where they accounted for up to 86% of the signal intensity. Splitting the acquisition range into 3 m/z ranges improved the number of detected features, the number of features with proposed annotation in the Human Metabolome Database, as well as signal intensity throughout the whole m/z range. The method performing best was the one using three m/z ranges of approximatively the same extent. Ionization source parameters also strongly affected the number of detected features. Splitting the acquisition range into 3 m/z ranges with optimized ionization source parameters allows a comprehensive analysis of the human plasma metabolome with perspectives for applications to pathophysiological studies.","['1 INSERM U1173, Plateforme de Spectrométrie de Masse, UFR Simone Veil - Santé, Université Versailles - Saint Quentin en Yvelines, Université Paris Saclay, Montigny le Bretonneux, France.', '2 CEA, LIST, Laboratory for Data Sciences and Decision, MetaboHUB-Paris, Gif-sur-Yvette, France.', '3 UPRES EA220, Université Versailles - Saint Quentin en Yvelines, Université Paris Saclay, Suresnes, France.', '4 UPRES EA220, Université Versailles - Saint Quentin en Yvelines, Université Paris Saclay, Suresnes, France; Département des Maladies des Voies Respiratoires, Hôpital Foch, Suresnes, France.', '5 INSERM U1173, Plateforme de Spectrométrie de Masse, UFR Simone Veil - Santé, Université Versailles - Saint Quentin en Yvelines, Université Paris Saclay, Montigny le Bretonneux, France; Département des Maladies des Voies Respiratoires, Hôpital Foch, Suresnes, France.

589,MS1 ion current-based quantitative proteomics: A promising solution for reliable analysis of large biological cohorts,"The rapidly-advancing field of pharmaceutical and clinical research calls for systematic, molecular-level characterization of complex biological systems. To this end, quantitative proteomics represents a powerful tool but an optimal solution for reliable large-cohort proteomics analysis, as frequently involved in pharmaceutical/clinical investigations, is urgently needed. Large-cohort analysis remains challenging owing to the deteriorating quantitative quality and snowballing missing data and false-positive discovery of altered proteins when sample size increases. MS1 ion current-based methods, which have become an important class of label-free quantification techniques during the past decade, show considerable potential to achieve reproducible protein measurements in large cohorts with high quantitative accuracy/precision. Nonetheless, in order to fully unleash this potential, several critical prerequisites should be met. Here we provide an overview of the rationale of MS1-based strategies and then important considerations for experimental and data processing techniques, with the emphasis on (i) efficient and reproducible sample preparation and LC separation; (ii) sensitive, selective and high-resolution MS detection; iii)accurate chromatographic alignment; (iv) sensitive and selective generation of quantitative features; and (v) optimal post-feature-generation data quality control. Prominent technical developments in these aspects are discussed.

Due to these and other improvements, top-down MS has become of broader interest and has started to be applied in more disciplines, such as the quality control of recombinant proteins, analysis and characterization of biopharmaceuticals, and clinical biochemistry to probe protein forms as potential disease biomarkers.

The structure and nanoscopic organization of its proteins are the basis of these qualities. In this study, the emission maxima of the autofluorescence from the protein core of major and minor ampullate silk fibers from the orb-web-weaving spider Nephila madagascariensis are determined and found to be 534 ± 11 and 547 ± 19 nm, respectively. Molecular conformational changes during applied strain are observed in both fiber types using two-photon excitation polarization measurements. Our findings showed that within the fibers the autofluorescent dipoles are separated into two distinct populations, one randomly orientated (amorphous regions) and one with aligned dipoles as found in crystalline structures. The crystalline-amorphous ratio was determined, and it was found that the crystalline dipoles made up around 30 and 20% of the autofluorescent dipoles in major and minor ampullate silk fibers, respectively. Using two-photon polarization measurements, it is possible to directly observe that the major and minor ampullate silk fibers structurally adapt to the applied stress, as well as discern different molecular conformational changes between major and minor ampullates. It was seen that the crystalline-amorphous ratio increased, with up to 9% for major fibers and 6% for minor fibers, as strain was applied, suggesting a conformational adaptation of the fiber, interpreted as noncrystalline 310-helices transforming into crystalline β-sheets.","['1 Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology , University of Southern Denmark , 5230 Odense , Denmark.']","Irina Iachina, Jonathan R Brewer, ",Biomacromolecules,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31074979

      To investigate the effect of directional current steering and short pulse stimulation in the ventral intermediate thalamic nucleus (VIM) on stimulation-induced side effects in patients with essential tremor. Methods:
      
    

    
      We recruited 8 patients with essential tremor in a stable postoperative condition (>3 months after electrode implantation of deep brain stimulation [DBS] electrodes) with segmented contacts implanted in the VIM. Tremor severity on acute stimulation was assessed by the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating Scale. Cerebellar impairment was evaluated with the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale. Patients rated paresthesia intensity with a visual analog scale. Results:
      
    

    
      In all patients, tremor was reduced to the same extent by VIM stimulation regardless of pulse width using energy dose-equivalent amplitudes. Short pulse stimulation diminished stimulation-induced ataxia of the upper extremities and paresthesia compared with conventional parameters. Directional steering with monopolar stimulation of single segments successfully suppressed tremor but also induced ataxia. No differences in adverse effects were found between single-segment stimulation conditions. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      These proof-of-principle findings provide evidence that acute short pulse stimulation is superior to directional steering in the subthalamic area to decrease stimulation-induced side effects while preserving tremor suppression effects in patients with tremor. Classification of evidence:
      
    

    
      This study provides Class IV evidence that for patients with tremor with thalamic DBS, acute short pulse stimulation reduces adverse effects, while directional steering does not provide a generalizable benefit regarding adverse effects.","['1 From the Departments of Neurology (C.-u.C., U.H., A.G., C.B., C.G., M.P.-N.), Neurosurgery (M.S., J.K., W.H.), and Neurophysiology and Pathophysiology (A.G., C.K.E.M.), University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany. cchoe@uke.de.', '2 From the Departments of Neurology (C.-u.C., U.H., A.G., C.B., C.G., M.P.-N.), Neurosurgery (M.S., J.K., W.H.), and Neurophysiology and Pathophysiology (A.G., C.K.E.M.), University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.']","Chi-Un Choe, Ute Hidding, Miriam Schaper, Alessandro Gulberti, Johannes Köppen, Carsten Buhmann, Christian Gerloff, Christian K E Moll, Wolfgang Hamel, Monika Pötter-Nerger, ",Neurology,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30045955

We find that single-photon ionization produces very similar results as two-photon ionization, showing that the probe process does not have a strong influence on the measured dynamics. The good agreement between the single-photon ionization experiments and the simulations shows that the norms of Dyson orbitals allow for qualitatively describing the ionization probabilities of 2TU. This reasonable performance of Dyson norms is attributed to the particular electronic structure of 2TU, where all important neutral and ionic states involve similar orbital transitions and thus the shape of the Dyson orbitals do not strongly depend on the initial neutral and final ionic state. We argue that similar situations should also occur in other biologically relevant thio-nucleobases, and that the time-resolved photoelectron spectra of these bases could therefore be adequately modeled with the techniques employed here.","['1 Institute of Theoretical Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, University of Vienna, Währinger Straße 17, 1090 Vienna, Austria. sebastian.mai@univie.ac.at.', '2 Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Georgia, Athens, GA 30602, USA.

597,Tolerance levels of mass density for CT number calibration in photon radiation therapy,"Computed tomography (CT) data are required to calculate the dose distribution in a patient's body. Generally, there are two CT number calibration methods for commercial radiotherapy treatment planning system (RTPS), namely CT number-relative electron density calibration (CT-RED calibration) and CT number-mass density calibration (CT-MD calibration). In a previous study, the tolerance levels of CT-RED calibration were established for each tissue type. The tolerance levels were established when the relative dose error to local dose reached 2%. However, the tolerance levels of CT-MD calibration are not established yet. We established the tolerance levels of CT-MD calibration based on the tolerance levels of CT-RED calibration. In order to convert mass density (MD) to relative electron density (RED), the conversion factors were determined with adult reference computational phantom data available in the International Commission on Radiological Protection publication 110 (ICRP-110). In order to validate the practicability of the conversion factor, the relative dose error and the dose linearity were validated with multiple RTPSes and dose calculation algorithms for two groups, namely, CT-RED calibration and CT-MD calibration. The tolerance levels of CT-MD calibration were determined from the tolerance levels of CT-RED calibration with conversion factors. The converted RED from MD was compared with actual RED calculated from ICRP-110. The conversion error was within ±0.01 for most standard organs. It was assumed that the conversion error was sufficiently small. The relative dose error difference for two groups was less than 0.3% for each tissue type. Therefore, the tolerance levels for CT-MD calibration were determined from the tolerance levels of CT-RED calibration with the conversion factors. The MD tolerance levels for lung, adipose/muscle, and cartilage/spongy-bone corresponded to ±0.044, ±0.022, and ±0.045 g/cm3 , respectively. The tolerance levels were useful in terms of approving the CT-MD calibration table for clinical use.","['1 Hiroshima High-Precision Radiotherapy Cancer Center, Hiroshima, Japan.', '2 Department of Radiation Oncology, Institute of Biomedical & Health Science, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', '3 Department of Radiology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', '4 Radiation Therapy Section, Department of Clinical Support, Hiroshima University Hospital, Hiroshima, Japan.', '5 Department of Radiology, Hiroshima Prefectural Hospital, Hiroshima, Japan.', '6 Radiation Therapy Department, Hiroshima City Hiroshima Citizens Hospital, Hiroshima, Japan.', '7 Division of Radiology, Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital & Atomic-bomb Survivors Hospital, Hiroshima, Japan.']","Minoru Nakao, Shuichi Ozawa, Katsunori Yogo, Hideharu Miura, Kiyoshi Yamada, Fumika Hosono, Masahiro Hayata, Kentaro Miki, Takeo Nakashima, Yusuke Ochi, Daisuke Kawahara, Yoshiharu Morimoto, Toru Yoshizaki, Hiroshige Nozaki, Kosaku Habara, Yasushi Nagata, ",Journal of applied clinical medical physics,2019 Jun,CT number calibration; mass density; photon radiation therapy; radiation treatment planning; tolerance level.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31081175
598,"MR-based CT metal artifact reduction for head-and-neck photon, electron, and proton radiotherapy","Purpose:
      
    

    
      We investigated the impact on computed tomography (CT) image quality and photon, electron, and proton head-and-neck (H&N) radiotherapy (RT) dose calculations of three CT metal artifact reduction (MAR) approaches: A CT-based algorithm (oMAR Philips Healthcare), manual water override, and our recently presented, Magnetic Resonance (MR)-based kerMAR algorithm. We considered the following three hypotheses: I: Manual water override improves MAR over the CT- and MR-based alternatives; II: The automatic algorithms (oMAR and kerMAR) improve MAR over the uncorrected CT; III: kerMAR improves MAR over oMAR. Methods:
      
    

    
      We included a veal shank phantom with/without six metal inserts and nine H&N RT patients with dental implants. We quantified the MAR capabilities by the reduction of outliers in the CT value distribution in regions of interest, and the change in particle range and photon depth at maximum dose. Results:
      
    

    
      Water override provided apparent image improvements in the soft tissue region but insignificantly or negatively influenced the dose calculations. We however found significant improvements in image quality and particle range impact, compared to the uncorrected CT, when using oMAR and kerMAR. kerMAR in turn provided superior improvements in terms of high intensity streak suppression compared to oMAR, again with associated impacts on the particle range estimates. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      We found no benefits of the water override compared to the rest, and tentatively reject hypothesis I. We however found improvements in the automatic algorithms, and thus support for hypothesis II, and found the MR-based kerMAR to improve upon oMAR, supporting hypothesis III.","['1 Department of Health Technology, Technical University of Denmark, 2800 Kgs., Lyngby, Denmark.', '2 Radiotherapy Research Unit, Department of Oncology, Gentofte and Herlev Hospital, University of Copenhagen, 2730, Herlev, Denmark.', '3 Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02114, USA.', '4 Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, 2100, Copenhagen, Denmark.']","Jonathan Scharff Nielsen, Koen Van Leemput, Jens Morgenthaler Edmund, ",Medical physics,2019 Oct,Bayesian modelling; CT metal artifact reduction; computed tomography; proton therapy; radiotherapy.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31332792

The fabricated microrings were designed for operation in the C-band (λ = 1565 nm) and exhibited a high-quality factor in air of 3.2 × 105. The bulk refractive index sensitivity of the devices was ~100 nm/RIU (for TM polarization) with a limit of detection of ~10-6 RIU. A surface functionalization protocol was developed to allow for the selective binding of the monoclonal antibodies designed to capture the target biomarker to the surface of the Al2O3 microrings. The detection of rhS100A4 proteins at clinically relevant concentrations in urine is a big milestone towards the use of biosensors for the screening and early diagnosis of different cancers.

601,Optothermal Manipulations of Colloidal Particles and Living Cells,"Optical manipulation techniques are important in many fields. For instance, they enable bottom-up assembly of nanomaterials and high-resolution and in situ analysis of biological cells and molecules, providing opportunities for discovery of new materials, medical diagnostics, and nanomedicines. Traditional optical tweezers have their applications limited due to the use of rigorous optics and high optical power. New strategies have been established for low-power optical manipulation techniques. Optothermal manipulation, which exploits photon-phonon conversion and matter migration under a light-controlled temperature gradient, is one such emerging technique. Elucidation of the underlying physics of optothermo-matter interaction and rational engineering of optical environments are required to realize diverse optothermal manipulation functionalities. This Account covers the working principles, design concepts, and applications of a series of newly developed optothermal manipulation techniques, including bubble-pen lithography, opto-thermophoretic tweezers, opto-thermoelectric tweezers, optothermal assembly, and opto-thermoelectric printing. In bubble-pen lithography, optical heating of a plasmonic substrate generates microbubbles at the solid-liquid interface to print diverse colloidal particles on the substrates. Programmable bubble printing of semiconductor quantum dots on different substrates and haptic control of printing have also been achieved. The key to optothermal tweezers is the ability to deliver colloidal particles from cold to hot regions of a temperature gradient or a negative Soret effect. We explore different driving forces for the two types of optothermal tweezers. Opto-thermophoretic tweezers rely on an abnormal permittivity gradient built by structured solvent molecules in the electric double layer of colloidal particles and living cells in response to heat-induced entropy, and opto-thermoelectric tweezers exploit a thermophoresis-induced thermoelectric field for the low-power manipulation of small nanoparticles with minimum diameter around 20 nm. Furthermore, by incorporating depletion attraction into the optothermal tweezers system as particle-particle or particle-substrate binding force, we have achieved bottom-up assembly and reconfigurable optical printing of artificial colloidal matter. Beyond optothermal manipulation techniques in liquid environments, we also review recent progress of gas-phase optothermal manipulation based on photophoresis. Photophoretic trapping and transport of light-absorbing materials have been achieved through optical engineering to tune particle-molecule interactions during optical heating, and a novel optical trap display has been demonstrated. An improved understanding of the colloidal response to temperature gradients will surely facilitate further innovations in optothermal manipulation. With their low-power operation, simple optics, and diverse functionalities, optothermal manipulation techniques will find a wide range of applications in life sciences, colloidal science, materials science, and nanoscience, as well as in the developments of colloidal functional devices and nanomedicine.","['1 Department of Mechanical Engineering and Texas Materials Institute , The University of Texas at Austin , Austin , Texas 78712 , United States.']","Linhan Lin, Eric H Hill, Xiaolei Peng, Yuebing Zheng, ",Accounts of chemical research,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29799720
602,Translational mechanobiology: Designing synthetic hydrogel matrices for improved in vitro models and cell-based therapies,"Synthetic hydrogels have ideal physiochemical properties to serve as reductionist mimics of the extracellular matrix (ECM) for studies on cellular mechanosensing. These studies range from basic observation of correlations between ECM mechanics and cell fate changes to molecular dissection of the underlying mechanisms. Despite intensive work on hydrogels to study mechanobiology, many fundamental questions regarding mechanosensing remain unanswered. In this review, I first discuss historical motivation for studying cellular mechanobiology, and challenges impeding this effort. I next overview recent efforts to engineer hydrogel properties to study cellular mechanosensing. Finally, I focus on in vitro modeling and cell-based therapies as applications of hydrogels that will exploit our ability to create micro-environments with physiologically relevant elasticity and viscoelasticity to control cell biology. These translational applications will not only use our current understanding of mechanobiology but will also bring new tools to study the fundamental problem of how cells sense their mechanical environment. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Hydrogels are an important tool for understanding how our cells can sense their mechanical environment, and to exploit that understanding in regenerative medicine. In the current review, I discuss historical work linking mechanics to cell behavior in vitro, and highlight the role hydrogels played in allowing us to understand how cells monitor mechanical cues. I then highlight potential translational applications of hydrogels with mechanical properties similar to those of the tissues where cells normally reside in our bodies, and discuss how these types of studies can provide clues to help us enhance our understanding of mechanosensing.","['1 Department of Biomedical Engineering, Washington University in Saint Louis, United States.

603,"Ultrasound-guided, open-source microneurography: Approaches to improve recordings from peripheral nerves in man","Objective:
      
    

    
      Microneurography is the only method for recording from single neurons in intact human nerves. It is challenging - requiring technical expertise, investment in specialised equipment and has sparse data yields. Methods:
      
    

    
      We assessed whether ultrasound guidance in combination with an 'open access' amplifier and data capture system (Open-Ephys) would simplify and expand the scope of microneurographic recordings in humans. Results:
      
    

    
      In 32 healthy consenting volunteers, ultrasound-guidance improved success rates for obtaining cutaneous C-fibres and reduced ""Skin to Nerve"" times from 28.5 min to 4.5 min for recordings of the peroneal nerve (P < 0.0001). We illustrate the potential utility of ultrasound-guided microneurography for difficult to access nerves with phrenic nerve recording during a Valsalva manoeuvre. We show that Open Ephys is a viable alternative to commercially available recording systems and offers advantages in terms of cost and software customisability. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Ultrasound guidance for microneurography with Open Ephys facilitates cutaneous C nociceptor recordings and allows recordings to be made from nerves previously considered inaccessible. Significance:
      
    

    
      We anticipate that the adoption of these techniques will improve microneurography experimental efficiency, adds an important visual learning aid and increases the generalisability of the approach.","['1 School of Physiology, Pharmacology & Neuroscience, University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom; Anaesthesia, Pain & Critical Care Sciences, Translational Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, BS2 8HW, United Kingdom.

604,Targeting cancer stem cells: protons versus photons,"Recent studies on cancer stem cells revealed they are tumorigenic and able to recapitulate the characteristics of the tumour from which they derive, so that it was suggested that elimination of this population is essential to prevent recurrences after any treatment. However, there is evidence that cancer stem cells are inherently resistant to conventional (photon) radiotherapy. Since the use of proton beam therapy in cancer treatment is growing rapidly worldwide, mainly because of their excellent dosimetric properties, the possibility could be considered that they also have biological advantages through preferential elimination of cancer stem cells.Indeed, a review of preclinical data suggest that protons and photons differ in their biological effects on cancer stem cells, with protons offering potential advantages, although the heterogeneity of cancer stem cells and the different proton irradiation modalities make the comparison of the results not so easy. Further research to understand the mechanisms underlying such effects is important for their possible exploitation in clinics and to perform proton beam therapy optimization.","['1 National Center for Innovative Technologies in Public Health, Istituto Superiore di Sanità (ISS) and Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare (INFN)-Roma 1, Rome, Italy.', '2 Independent researcher, Italy (formerly Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Rome, Italy).']","Valentina Dini, Mauro Belli, Maria Antonella Tabocchini, ",The British journal of radiology,2020 Mar,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31432694
605,Biophysical clocks face a trade-off between internal and external noise resistance,"Many organisms use free running circadian clocks to anticipate the day night cycle. However, others organisms use simple stimulus-response strategies ('hourglass clocks') and it is not clear when such strategies are sufficient or even preferable to free running clocks. Here, we find that free running clocks, such as those found in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus and humans, can efficiently project out light intensity fluctuations due to weather patterns ('external noise') by exploiting their limit cycle attractor. However, such limit cycles are necessarily vulnerable to 'internal noise'. Hence, at sufficiently high internal noise, point attractor-based 'hourglass' clocks, such as those found in a smaller cyanobacterium with low protein copy number, Prochlorococcus marinus, can outperform free running clocks. By interpolating between these two regimes in a diverse range of oscillators drawn from across biology, we demonstrate biochemical clock architectures that are best suited to different relative strengths of external and internal noise.","['1 Department of Physics, University of Chicago, Chicago, United States.', '2 The James Franck Institute, University of Chicago, Chicago, United States.', '3 Medical Scientist Training Program, Pritzker School of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, United States.', '4 Department of Molecular Genetics and Cell Biology, University of Chicago, Chicago, United States.']","Weerapat Pittayakanchit, Zhiyue Lu, Justin Chew, Michael J Rust, Arvind Murugan, ",eLife,2018,circadian clocks; computational biology; cyanobacteria; noise; oscillators; physics of living systems; systems biology.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29988019
606,Von Helmholtz's ophthalmometer: historical review and experience with one of the last surviving original devices,"Hermann von Helmholtz (1821-1894) was one of the most important scientists of the nineteenth century in optics and ophthalmology. One of his significant contributions in the field of vision sciences was the invention of the ophthalmometer in 1850, which was the precursor of the keratometers still used in clinical practice today. However, this development tends to be little recognized, and to be overshadowed by others of the achievements of this singular scientist. This review describes the historical setting behind the von Helmholtz's ophthalmometer and its mechanism. We also describe the modifications that were later made to the design. We report on our experience measuring a living human cornea with one of the last surviving devices in the world. The ophthalmometer by von Helmholtz marked the beginning of an era in the ophthalmology of the late nineteenth century, and although its original design was not broadly used in the clinical practice, and later abandoned, it opened the way for the development of practical systems very similar to the ones that we use even today.","['1 Utrecht Cornea Research Group, Department of Ophthalmology, University Medical Center, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', '2 Centro Oftalmológico Virgilio Galvis, Floridablanca, Colombia.', '3 Ophthalmology Department, Universidad Autónoma de Bucaramanga, Bucaramanga, Colombia.']","Daniel A Godefrooij, Virgilio Galvis, Alejandro Tello, ",Acta ophthalmologica,2018 May,Hermann von Helmholtz; cornea; history of ophthalmology; keratometer; keratometry; ophthalmometer.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28772001
607,Human Transcriptomic Response to Mixed Neutron-Photon Exposures Relevant to an Improvised Nuclear Device,"In the possible event of a detonation of an improvised nuclear device (IND), the immediate radiation would consist of both photons (gamma rays) and neutrons. Since neutrons generally have a high relative biological effectiveness (RBE) for most physiological end points, it is important to understand the effect that neutrons would have on the biodosimetry methods that are being developed for medical triage purposes. We previously compared the transcriptomic response in human blood after neutron and photon irradiation. In this study, we analyzed the effect of mixed-field-neutron-photon radiation on gene expression responses in human peripheral blood, to elucidate the neutron contribution in the setting of a radiation exposure from an IND detonation. We used four combinations of mixed neutron-photon exposures, with increasing percentages of neutrons, to a cumulative dose of 3 Gy. The mixed-field exposures consisted of 0%, 5%, 15% and 25% of neutrons, where 0% corresponds to 3 Gy of pure X rays. A maximum neutron exposure, corresponding to 83% neutrons (0.75 Gy) was also used in the study. Increases were observed in both the number and expression level of genes, with increasing percentages of neutrons from 0% to 25% in the mixed-field exposures. Gene ontology analysis showed an overall predominance of TP53 signaling among upregulated genes across all exposures. Some TP53 regulated genes, such as EDA2R, GDF15 and VWCE, demonstrated increased expression with increasing neutron percentages in mixed-field exposures. Immune response, specifically natural-killer-cell mediated signaling, was the most significant biological process associated with downregulated genes. We observed significant suppression of T-cell-mediated signaling in mixed-field exposures, which was absent in the response to pure photons. In this first study investigating gene expression in human blood cells exposed to mixed neutron-photon fields similar to an actual IND explosion, we have identified a number of genes responding to the 3 Gy dose that showed increasing expression as the neutron percentage increased. Such genes may serve as better indicators of the expected biological damage than a report of total physical dose, and thus provide more relevant information for treating physicians.","['1 a Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York 10032.', '2 b Radiological Research Accelerator Facility, Columbia University, Irvington, New York 10533.']","Sanjay Mukherjee, Veljko Grilj, Constantinos G Broustas, Shanaz A Ghandhi, Andrew D Harken, Guy Garty, Sally A Amundson, ",Radiation research,2019 Aug,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31237816

Here, we present a meta-analysis assessing and comparing the sub-cellular resolution of 29 such mass spectrometry-based spatial proteomics experiments using a newly developed tool termed QSep.

610,The role of the head in configural body processing: Behavioural and electrophysiological evidence from the inversion and scrambling effect,"The present study aimed to further explore the role of the head for configural body processing by comparing complete bodies with headless bodies and faceless heads (Experiment 1). A second aim was to further explore the role of the eye region in configural face processing (Experiment 2). Due to that, we conducted a second experiment with complete faces, eyeless faces, and eyes. In addition, we used two effects to manipulate configural processing: the effect of stimulus inversion and scrambling. The current data clearly show an inversion effect for intact bodies presented with head and faces including the eye region. Thus, the head and the eye region seem to be central for configural processes that are manipulated by the effect of stimulus inversion. Furthermore, the behavioural and electrophysiological body inversion effect depends on the intact configuration of bodies and is associated with the N170 as the face inversion effect depends on the intact face configuration. Hence, configural body processing depends not only on the presence of the head but rather on a complete representation of human bodies that includes the body and the head. Furthermore, configural face processing relies on intact and complete face representations that include faces and eyes.","['1 Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, Department of Neuropsychology, Ruhr University Bochum, Germany.']","Denise Soria Bauser, Boris Suchan, ","British journal of psychology (London, England : 1953)",2018 Aug,N170; body inversion effect; face inversion effect; first-order relational information.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29336028

Top hat-shaped holders for the marble electrodes were developed with an electrode cap to acquire the signals. In 12 healthy volunteers, we compared the VEPs obtained with conventional gold-cup electrodes to those obtained with marble electrodes. Checkerboards of two check sizes-0.8° and 0.25°-were presented. Despite the higher impedance of the marble electrodes, the line noise could be completely removed by averaging 64 single traces, and VEPs could be recorded. Linear mixed-effect models using electrode type, stimulus, and recording duration revealed a statistically significant effect of the electrode type on only VEP N75 peak latency (mean ± SEM: 1.0 ± 1.2 ms) and amplitude (mean ± SEM: 0.8 ± 0.9 µV) The mean amplitudes of the delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma frequency bands of marble electrodes were statistically significantly different and, on average, 25% higher than those of gold-cup electrodes. However, the mean amplitudes showed a statistically significant strong correlation (Pearson's r = 0.8). We therefore demonstrate the potential of the inexpensive and efficient hydrogel electrode to replace conventional gold-cup electrodes for the recording of VEPs and possibly other recordings from the human cortex.","['1 Institute for Ophthalmic Research, Centre for Ophthalmology, University of Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.', '2 University Eye Hospital, Centre for Ophthalmology, University of Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.', '3 STC Eyetrial at the Centre for Ophthalmology, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.', '4 Werner Reichardt Centre for Integrative Neuroscience (CIN), University of Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.']","Torsten Straßer, Susanne Kramer, Melanie Kempf, Tobias Peters, Anne Kurtenbach, Eberhart Zrenner, ","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019,biomedical electrodes; brain–computer interfaces; superabsorbent polymer gel; visual electrophysiology.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31717510

ElectroMap analysis options cover a wide variety of key electrophysiological parameters, and the graphical user interface allows straightforward modification of pre-processing and parameter definitions, making ElectroMap applicable to a wide range of experimental models. We show how built-in pacing frequency detection and signal segmentation allows high-throughput analysis of entire experimental recordings, acute responses, and single beat-to-beat variability. Additionally, ElectroMap incorporates automated multi-beat averaging to improve signal quality of noisy datasets, and here we demonstrate how this feature can help elucidate electrophysiological changes that might otherwise go undetected when using single beat analysis. Custom modules are included within the software for detailed investigation of conduction, single file analysis, and alternans, as demonstrated here.

However, it is a multiscale problem requiring the solution of billions of differential equations describing the complex electrophysiology of interconnected cells. Therefore, large-scale cardiac modeling has been limited to groups with access to supercomputers and clusters.

616,Exploring the Dual Interaction of Natural Rhamnolipids with Plant and Fungal Biomimetic Plasma Membranes through Biophysical Studies,"Rhamnolipids (RLs) are potential biocontrol agents for crop culture protection. Their mode of action has been proposed as dual, combining plant protection activation and antifungal activities. The present work focuses on the interaction of natural RLs with plant and fungi membrane models at the molecular scale. Representative models were constructed and the interaction with RLs was studied by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance (²H NMR) spectroscopic measurements. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were performed to investigate RL insertion in lipid bilayers. Our results showed that the RLs fit into the membrane models and were located near the lipid phosphate group of the phospholipid bilayers, nearby phospholipid glycerol backbones. The results obtained with plant plasma membrane models suggest that the insertion of RLs inside the lipid bilayer did not significantly affect lipid dynamics. Oppositely, a clear fluidity increase of fungi membrane models was observed. This effect was related to the presence and the specific structure of ergosterol. The nature of the phytosterols could also influence the RL effect on plant plasma membrane destabilization. Subtle changes in lipid dynamics could then be linked with plant defense induction and the more drastic effects associated with fungal membrane destabilization.","['1 Unité de Génie Enzymatique et Cellulaire, CNRS UMR 7025, Université de Picardie Jules Verne (UPJV), 80039 Amiens, France. noadya@gmail.com.', '2 Unité de Génie Enzymatique et Cellulaire, CNRS UMR 7025, Sorbonne Universités, Université de Technologie de Compiègne, 60200 Compiègne, France. noadya@gmail.com.', '3 Unité de Génie Enzymatique et Cellulaire, CNRS UMR 7025, Université de Picardie Jules Verne (UPJV), 80039 Amiens, France. furlanaurelien@gmail.com.', '4 Unité de Génie Enzymatique et Cellulaire, CNRS UMR 7025, Université de Picardie Jules Verne (UPJV), 80039 Amiens, France. sebastien.buchoux@u-picardie.fr.', '5 Laboratoire de Biophysique Moléculaire aux Interfaces, Gembloux Agro-Bio Tech, B5030 Gembloux, Belgium. magali.deleu@uliege.be.', '6 Matrice Extracellulaire et Dynamique Cellulaire, UMR CNRS 7369, Chaire MAgICS, Université de Reims Champagne-Ardenne (URCA), 51687 Reims, France. manuel.dauchez@univ-reims.fr.', '7 Unité de Génie Enzymatique et Cellulaire, CNRS UMR 7025, Sorbonne Universités, Université de Technologie de Compiègne, 60200 Compiègne, France. sonia.rippa@utc.fr.', '8 Unité de Génie Enzymatique et Cellulaire, CNRS UMR 7025, Université de Picardie Jules Verne (UPJV), 80039 Amiens, France. catherine.sarazin@u-picardie.fr.']","Noadya Monnier, Aurélien L Furlan, Sébastien Buchoux, Magali Deleu, Manuel Dauchez, Sonia Rippa, Catherine Sarazin, ",International journal of molecular sciences,2019,biomimetic lipid membrane; ergosterol; fungi plasma membrane; membrane insertion and dynamic; membrane sterol; phytosterols; plant plasma membrane; rhamnolipid.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30813553
617,Surface Electromyographic Biofeedback as a Rehabilitation Tool for Patients with Global Brachial Plexus Injury Receiving Bionic Reconstruction,"In patients with global brachial plexus injury and lack of biological treatment alternatives, bionic reconstruction, including the elective amputation of the functionless hand and its replacement with a prosthesis, has recently been described. Optimal prosthetic function depends on a structured rehabilitation protocol, as residual muscle activity in a patient's arm is later translated into prosthetic function. Surface electromyographic (sEMG) biofeedback has been used during rehabilitation after stroke, but has so far not been used in patients with complex peripheral nerve injuries. Here, we present our rehabilitation protocol implemented in patients with global brachial plexus injuries suitable for bionic reconstruction, starting from identification of sEMG signals to final prosthetic training. This structured rehabilitation program facilitates motor relearning, which may be a cognitively debilitating process after complex nerve root avulsion injuries, aberrant re-innervation and extra-anatomical reconstruction (as is the case with nerve transfer surgery). The rehabilitation protocol using sEMG biofeedback aids in the establishment of new motor patterns as patients are being made aware of the advancing re-innervation process of target muscles. Additionally, faint signals may also be trained and improved using sEMG biofeedback, rendering a clinically ""useless"" muscle (exhibiting muscle strength M1 on the British Medical Research Council [BMRC] scale) eligible for dexterous prosthetic hand control. Furthermore, functional outcome scores after successful bionic reconstruction are presented in this article.","['1 Clinical Laboratory for Bionic Extremity Reconstruction, Medical University of Vienna; Department of Orthopaedics and Trauma Surgery, Medical University of Vienna.', '2 Clinical Laboratory for Bionic Extremity Reconstruction, Medical University of Vienna; Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London; agnes.sturma@meduniwien.ac.at.', '3 Clinical Laboratory for Bionic Extremity Reconstruction, Medical University of Vienna; Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Department of Surgery, Medical University of Vienna.']","Laura A Hruby, Agnes Sturma, Oskar C Aszmann, ",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31609322

A guide for cardiac electrophysiologists,"The key to a successful catheterization of the left heart chambers is the safe transseptal puncture. Intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) is an attractive tool used in cardiac catheterization and electrophysiology labs to provide detailed images thatcan facilitate transseptal puncture. ICE permits a direct visualization of the endocardium and precisely locates the needle and the sheath against the interatrial septum. Two different ICE catheters are available: a phased array and a mechanical transducer, both being currently used in clinical practice. This paper describes the technique used for guiding transseptal puncture with ICE. Due to its advantages, ICE has currently become an important tool used to maximize the safety of the transseptal puncture and increase efficacy of interventional cardiology procedures.","['1 ""Iuliu Hatieganu"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 5th Department of Internal Medicine, Cardiology-Rehabilitation, Cluj-Napoca, Romania. rosu.radu1053@gmail.com.', '2 ""Iuliu Hatieganu"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 5th Department of Internal Medicine, Cardiology-Rehabilitation, Cluj-Napoca, Romania. gabi_cismaru@yahoo.com.', '3 ""Emile Muller"" Hospital, Cardiology Department, 68100 Mulhouse, France.. lmure_san@yahoo.com.', '4 ""Iuliu Hatieganu"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 5th Department of Internal Medicine, Cardiology-Rehabilitation, Cluj-Napoca Romania. puiu.mihai@yahoo.com.', '5 ""Iuliu Hatieganu"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 5th Department of Internal Medicine, Cardiology-Rehabilitation, Cluj-Napoca, Romania. gusetu@gmail.com.', '6 ""Iuliu Hatieganu"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 5th Department of Internal Medicine, Cardiology-Rehabilitation, Cluj-Napoca, Romania. sabina.istratoaie@gmail.com.', '7 ""Iuliu Hatieganu"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 5th Department of Internal Medicine, Cardiology-Rehabilitation, Cluj-Napoca, Romania. pop67dana@gmail.com.', '8 ""Iuliu Hatieganu"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 5th Department of Internal Medicine, Cardiology-Rehabilitation, Cluj-Napoca, Romania. dzdrenghea@yahoo.com.']","Radu Rosu, Gabriel Cismaru, Lucian Muresan, Mihai Puiu, Gabriel Gusetu, Sabina Istratoaie, Dana Pop, Dumitru Zdrenghea, ",Medical ultrasonography,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31063523

621,A flexible geometry for panoramic visual and optogenetic stimulation during behavior and physiology,"Background:
      
    

    
      To study visual processing, it is necessary to precisely control visual stimuli while recording neural and behavioral responses. It can be important to present stimuli over a broad area of the visual field, which can be technically difficult. New method:
      
    

    
      We present a simple geometry that can be used to display panoramic stimuli. A single digital light projector generates images that are reflected by mirrors onto flat screens that surround an animal. It can be used for behavioral and neurophysiological measurements, so virtually identical stimuli can be presented. Moreover, this geometry permits light from the projector to be used to activate optogenetic tools. Results:
      
    

    
      Using this geometry, we presented panoramic visual stimulation to Drosophila in three paradigms. We presented drifting contrast gratings while recording walking and turning speed. We used the same projector to activate optogenetic channels during visual stimulation. Finally, we used two-photon microscopy to record responses in direction-selective cells to drifting gratings. Comparison with existing method(s):
      
    

    
      Existing methods have typically required custom hardware or curved screens, while this method requires only flat back projection screens and a digital light projector. The projector generates images in real time and does not require pre-generated images. Finally, while many setups are large, this geometry occupies a 30 × 20 cm footprint with a 25 cm height. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      This flexible geometry enables measurements of behavioral and neural responses to panoramic stimuli. This allows moderate throughput behavioral experiments with simultaneous optogenetic manipulation, with easy comparisons between behavior and neural activity using virtually identical stimuli.","['1 Interdepartmental Neuroscience Program, Yale University, New Haven, CT, United States.', '2 Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, Yale University, New Haven, CT, United States.', '3 Interdepartmental Neuroscience Program, Yale University, New Haven, CT, United States; Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, Yale University, New Haven, CT, United States; Department of Physics, Yale University, New Haven, CT, United States; Department of Neuroscience, Yale University, New Haven, CT, United States.

622,What is the most appropriate method for coronary sinus cannulation? The telescopic method or the electrophysiologic method?,"Objectives:
      
    

    
      The most challenging stage of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is coronary sinus cannulation (CS). The aim of this study was to compare coronary sinus cannulation techniques using electrophysiology catheters and coronary angiography catheters. Methods:
      
    

    
      In this observational, retrospective and non-randomized study, 87 patients who were eligible for CRT device implantation were screened at Kahramanmaras Sutcu Imam University Hospital between March 2014 and March 2018. Seventy-two patients who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in the study. The study population was divided into 2 groups: the first group consisted of 36 patients whose coronary sinuses were cannulated via electrophysiology (EP) catheters and the second group included 36 patients who received coronary angiography catheters for coronary sinus cannulation. Results:
      
    

    
      The two groups were similar in terms of the baseline characteristics of the patients. The total fluoroscopy time was less with cannulation using coronary angiography catheters. There were no differences between the two groups in terms of the amount of contrast material and the success of the operations. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Coronary sinus catheterization using coronary angiography catheters significantly reduces fluoroscopy time in patients undergoing CRT.","['1 Department of Cardiology, Sutcu Imam University, Kahramanmaras, Turkey.', '2 Department of Cardiology, Adıyaman University, Adıyaman, Turkey.', '3 Department of Physiology, Cumhuriyet University, Sivas, Turkey.']","Hakan Gunes, Ekrem Aksu, Huseyin Nacar, Murat Kerkutluoglu, Handan Gunes, Sami Ozgul, ",PloS one,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30216349
623,Intraspinal microstimulation for respiratory muscle activation,"A complex propriospinal network is synaptically coupled to phrenic and intercostal motoneurons, and this makes it difficult to predict how gray matter intraspinal microstimulation (ISMS) will recruit respiratory motor units. We therefore mapped the cervical and high thoracic gray matter at locations which ISMS activates diaphragm (DIA) and external intercostal (EIC) motor units. Respiratory muscle electromyography (EMG) was recorded in anesthetized female spinally intact adult rats while a stimulating electrode was advanced ventrally into the spinal cord in 600μm increments. At each depth, single biphasic stimuli were delivered at 10-90μA during both the inspiratory and expiratory phase independently. Twenty electrode tracks were made from C2-T1 at medial and lateral gray matter locations. During inspiration, ISMS evoked DIA and EIC activity throughout C2-T1 gray matter locations, with mutual activation occurring at 17±9% of sites. During inspiratory phase ISMS the average latency for DIA activation was 4.40±0.70ms. During the expiratory phase, ISMS-induced DIA activation required electrodes to be in close proximity to the phrenic motoneuron pool, and average activation latency was 3.30±0.50ms. We conclude that appropriately targeted ISMS can co-activate DIA and EIC motor units, and endogenous respiratory drive has a powerful impact on ISMS-induced respiratory motor unit activation. The long latency diaphragm motor unit activation suggests the presence of a complex propriospinal network that can modulate phrenic motor output.","['1 Rehabilitation Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States; Center for Sensorimotor Neural Engineering (CSNE), Seattle, WA, United States; Physical Therapy and McKnight Brain Institute, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, United States.

624,Preparation of Rhythmically-active In Vitro Neonatal Rodent Brainstem-spinal Cord and Thin Slice,"Mammalian inspiratory rhythm is generated from a neuronal network in a region of the medulla called the preBötzinger complex (pBC), which produces a signal driving the rhythmic contraction of inspiratory muscles. Rhythmic neural activity generated in the pBC and carried to other neuronal pools to drive the musculature of breathing may be studied using various approaches, including en bloc nerve recordings and transverse slice recordings. However, previously published methods have not extensively described the brainstem-spinal cord dissection process in a transparent and reproducible manner for future studies. Here, we present a comprehensive overview of a method used to reproducibly cut rhythmically-active brainstem slices containing the necessary and sufficient neuronal circuitry for generating and transmitting inspiratory drive. This work builds upon previous brainstem-spinal cord electrophysiology protocols to enhance the likelihood of reliably obtaining viable and rhythmically-active slices for recording neuronal output from the pBC, hypoglossal premotor neurons (XII pMN), and hypoglossal motor neurons (XII MN).

The presence of distinct populations of corneal leukocytes (CLs) in the normal cornea has been firmly established. However, their precise function and kinetics remain, as of yet, unclear. Through intravital multiphoton microscopy (IV-MPM), allowing the means to accumulate critical spatial and temporal cellular information, we provide details for long-term investigation of CL morphology and kinetics under steady state and following inflammation. Significant alterations in size and morphology of corneal CD11c+ dendritic cells (DCs) were noted following acute sterile inflammation, including cell volume (4364.4 ± 489.6 vs. 1787.6 ± 111.0 μm3, P < 0.001) and sphericity (0.82 ± 0.01 vs. 0.42 ± 0.02, P < 0.001) compared with steady state. Furthermore, IV-MPM analyses revealed alterations in both the CD11c+ DC and major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC)-II+ mature antigen-presenting cell population kinetics during inflammation, including track displacement length (CD11c: 16.57 ± 1.41 vs. 4.64 ± 0.56 μm, P < 0.001; MHC-II: 9.03 ± 0.37 vs. 4.09 ± 0.39, P < 0.001) and velocity (CD11c: 1.91 ± 0.07 μm/min vs. 1.73 ± 0.1302 μm/min; MHC-II: 2.97 ± 0.07 vs. 1.62 ± 0.08, P < 0.001) compared with steady state.

629,A Copula-Based Granger Causality Measure for the Analysis of Neural Spike Train Data,"In systems neuroscience, it is becoming increasingly common to record the activity of hundreds of neurons simultaneously via electrode arrays. The ability to accurately measure the causal interactions among multiple neurons in the brain is crucial to understanding how neurons work in concert to generate specific brain functions. The development of new statistical methods for assessing causal influence between spike trains is still an active field of neuroscience research. Here, we suggest a copula-based Granger causality measure for the analysis of neural spike train data. This method is built upon our recent work on copula Granger causality for the analysis of continuous-valued time series by extending it to point-process neural spike train data. The proposed method is therefore able to reveal nonlinear and high-order causality in the spike trains while retaining all the computational advantages such as model-free, efficient estimation, and variability assessment of Granger causality. The performance of our algorithm can be further boosted with time-reversed data.

630,"Proteomics, Glycomics, and Glycoproteomics of Matrisome Molecules","The most straightforward applications of proteomics database searching involve intracellular proteins. Although intracellular gene products number in the thousands, their well-defined post-translational modifications (PTMs) makes database searching practical. By contrast, cell surface and extracellular matrisome proteins pass through the secretory pathway where many become glycosylated, modulating their physicochemical properties, adhesive interactions, and diversifying their functions. Although matrisome proteins number only a few hundred, their high degree of complex glycosylation multiplies the number of theoretical proteoforms by orders of magnitude. Given that extracellular networks that mediate cell-cell and cell-pathogen interactions in physiology depend on glycosylation, it is important to characterize the proteomes, glycomes, and glycoproteomes of matrisome molecules that exist in a given biological context. In this review, we summarize proteomics approaches for characterizing matrisome molecules, with an emphasis on applications to brain diseases.

631,Phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility testing of pathogenic bacteria using photonic readout methods: recent achievements and impact,"The development of antibiotic resistances in common pathogens is an increasing challenge for therapy of infections and especially severe complications like sepsis. To prevent administration of broad-spectrum and potentially non-effective antibiotics, the susceptibility spectrum of the pathogens underlying the infection has to be determined. Current phenotypic standard methods for antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) require the isolation of pathogens from the patient and the subsequent culturing in the presence of antibiotics leading to results only after 24-72 h. Since the early initialization of an effective antibiotic therapy is crucial for positive treatment result in severe infections, faster methods of AST are urgently needed. A large number of different assay systems are currently tested for their practicability for fast detection of antibiotic resistance profiles. They can be divided into genotypic ones which detect the presence of certain genes or gene products associated with resistances and phenotypic assays which determine the effect of antibiotics on the pathogens. In this mini-review, we summarize current developments in fast phenotypic tests that use photonic approaches and critically discuss their status. We further outline steps that are required to bring these assays into clinical practice.","['1 Leibniz Institute of Photonic Technology, Albert-Einstein-Str. 9, 07745, Jena, Germany.', '2 Jena Biophotonics and Imaging Laboratory, 07745, Jena, Germany.', '3 Center for Sepsis Control and Care, Jena University Hospital, Am Klinikum 1, 07747, Jena, Germany.', '4 Institute of Physical Chemistry, Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Helmholtzweg 4, 07743, Jena, Germany.', '5 InfectoGnostics Research Campus Jena, Philosophenweg 7, Jena, Germany.', '6 Leibniz Institute of Photonic Technology, Albert-Einstein-Str. 9, 07745, Jena, Germany. ute.neugebauer@med.uni-jena.de.', '7 Jena Biophotonics and Imaging Laboratory, 07745, Jena, Germany. ute.neugebauer@med.uni-jena.de.', '8 Center for Sepsis Control and Care, Jena University Hospital, Am Klinikum 1, 07747, Jena, Germany. ute.neugebauer@med.uni-jena.de.', '9 Institute of Physical Chemistry, Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Helmholtzweg 4, 07743, Jena, Germany. ute.neugebauer@med.uni-jena.de.', '10 InfectoGnostics Research Campus Jena, Philosophenweg 7, Jena, Germany. ute.neugebauer@med.uni-jena.de.']","Astrid Tannert, Richard Grohs, Jürgen Popp, Ute Neugebauer, ",Applied microbiology and biotechnology,2019 Jan,Fluorescence; IR; Microscopy; Raman; Rapid susceptibility test; Scattering; Spectroscopy.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30443798
632,"Olfactory sensitivity to major, intermediate and trace components of sex pheromone in Ceratitis capitata is related to mating and circadian rhythm","The Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata Wied., is a worldwide pest of several fruits given its extremely wide host range which includes more than 250 different species of fruits and vegetables. Its high biological potential is mainly due both to its ability to readily adapt to new environments and its high reproductive capacity as it completes multiple generations each year. Since sexually mature males emit a sex pheromone to call both other males for ""lekking"" and receptive females for mating, many studies have been directed to characterize the chemical composition of the sex pheromone. Besides, the release of sex pheromone appears to be modulated both by mating and time of day. Based on these considerations, we measured the olfactory sensitivity of antennae and palps of C. capitata to six volatiles of the male sex-pheromone: α-farnesene and geranyl acetate (major components), linalool and β-myrcene (intermediate components), β-farnesene and 2,3-butanediol (minor/trace components). The electroantennogram (EAG) and electropalpogram (EPG) responses were evaluated in both sexes, at different physiological states (virgin and mated), and at different times of the day (morning and afternoon). The results show that the EAG amplitude values in response to all stimuli are higher in the morning than in the afternoon for both sexes and in both virgin and mated insects. Furthermore, in both sexes, the olfactory sensitivity of virgin insects is higher than in mated ones. The EPG amplitude in response to all stimuli is higher in the morning in mated females than in virgin females and higher in the morning than in the afternoon in both mated sexes. By gaining knowledge on the effects of sex, physiological state and time of day on the olfactory sensitivity of C. capitata, one could better understand the medfly reproductive behavior.","['1 Department of Biomedical Sciences, Section of Physiology, University of Cagliari, 09042 Monserrato, CA, Italy.

634,A Formal Approach for Scalable Simulation of Gastric ICC Electrophysiology,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Efficient and accurate organ models are crucial for closed-loop validation of implantable medical devices. This paper investigates bio-electric slow wave modeling of the stomach, so that gastric electrical stimulator (GES) can be validated and verified prior to implantation. In particular, we consider high-fidelity, scalable, and efficient modeling of the pacemaker, Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), based on the formal hybrid input output automata (HIOA) framework. Methods:
      
    

    
      Our work is founded in formal methods, a collection of mathematically sound techniques originating in computer science for the design and validation of safety-critical systems. We modeled each ICC cell using an HIOA. We also introduce an HIOA path model to capture the electrical propagation delay between cells in a network. The resultant network of ICC cells can simulate normal and diseased action potential propagation patterns, making it useful for device validation. Results:
      
    

    
      The simulated slow wave of a single ICC cell had high correlation ( ≈ 0.9) with the corresponding biophysical models. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The proposed model is able to simulate the slow wave activity of a network of ICC cells with high-fidelity for device validation. Significance:
      
    

    
      The proposed HIOA model is significantly more efficient than the corresponding biophysical models, scales to larger networks of ICC cells, and is capable of simulating varying propagation patterns. This has the potential to enable verification and validation of implantable GESs in closed-loop with gastrointestinal models in the future.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Luman Wang, Avinash Malik, Partha S Roop, Leo K Cheng, Niranchan Paskaranandavadivel, ",IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,2019 Dec,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30869606
635,From biophysics to 'omics and systems biology,"Recent decades brought a revolution to biology, driven mainly by exponentially increasing amounts of data coming from ""'omics"" sciences. To handle these data, bioinformatics often has to combine biologically heterogeneous signals, for which methods from statistics and engineering (e.g. machine learning) are often used. While such an approach is sometimes necessary, it effectively treats the underlying biological processes as a black box. Similarly, systems biology deals with inherently complex systems, characterized by a large number of degrees of freedom, and interactions that are highly non-linear. To deal with this complexity, the underlying physical interactions are often (over)simplified, such as in Boolean modelling of network dynamics. In this review, we argue for the utility of applying a biophysical approach in bioinformatics and systems biology, including discussion of two examples from our research which address sequence analysis and understanding intracellular gene expression dynamics.","['1 Faculty of Biology, Institute of Physiology and Biochemistry, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia. dmarko@bio.bg.ac.rs.', '2 Faculty of Biology, Institute of Physiology and Biochemistry, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.', '3 Interdisciplinary PhD Program in Biophysics, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.']","Marko Djordjevic, Andjela Rodic, Stefan Graovac, ",European biophysics journal : EBJ,2019 Jul,Biophysical modelling; Gene expression regulation; Intracellular dynamics; Sequence analysis; Systems biology.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30972433
636,Proof of Concept for a Universal Identification System for Medical Devices,"Medical devices need a unified way of accessing information that uniquely identifies them. This can provide traceability to specifications, lot numbers, recalls, and the like. Such a system would have applications for devices both in and out of the body. Common barcodes, such as a UPC code, can only be read in plain sight, when nothing comes between the scanner and the code. UPC coding is not suitable for all medical devices because some are implanted in the body or are otherwise inaccessible without invasive techniques. This article demonstrates a proof of concept for XRF coding on devices. Material codes were made and read externally by an XRF reader. The reading showed trace amounts of the chemicals that compose the medical device in the background signal. The energy levels of the chemicals were assigned values to build a readable code correlated with information about the medical device it is attached to. Attachment can be made during material synthesis, part or product manufacture, or even after final assembly. The technique demonstrated here is a promising concept for the future of medical device detection.","['1 School of Biological and Health Systems Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona.', '2 Mayo Clinic Arizona, School of Medicine Scottsdale, Arizona.']","Courtney Mason, Benjamin Erlick, Jeffrey T La Belle, ",Critical reviews in biomedical engineering,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31679243

Difficulty with feedback processing may underlie this impairment. We examined neural correlates of feedback processing using event-related potentials (ERPs) in 49 prenatally cocaine-exposed (PCE) and 34 nondrug exposed (NDE) adolescents. Adolescents performed a reward-feedback task with win/no-win feedback in a chance-based task. We investigated amplitude and latency of the feedback-related negativity (FRN) and P300 ERP components and source-based estimates elicited during feedback processing. PCE adolescents had smaller P300 amplitudes for no-win feedback, and source analysis in the P300 time window revealed differences between groups localized to the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex.","['1 a Department of Psychiatry , Yale University School of Medicine , New Haven , CT , USA.', '2 d Department of Psychiatry, Child Study Center , Yale University School of Medicine , New Haven , CT , USA.', '3 g Haskins Laboratories , New Haven , CT , USA.', '4 b National Center on Addictions and Substance Abuse , Yale University School of Medicine , New Haven , CT , USA.', '5 c Department of Psychology , University of Maryland , College Park , MD , USA.', '6 e Department of Neuroscience , Yale University School of Medicine , New Haven , CT , USA.', '7 f Department of Psychiatry, Connecticut Mental Health Center , New Haven , CT , USA.']","Kristen P Morie, Jia Wu, Nicole Landi, Marc N Potenza, Linda C Mayes, Michael J Crowley, ",Developmental neuropsychology,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29461102
638,Electrophysiology in diagnosis and management of neuropathic pain,"Electrophysiological techniques demonstrate abnormalities in somatosensory transmission, hence providing objective evidence of 'somatosensory lesion or disease' which is crucial to the diagnosis of neuropathic pain (NP). Since most instances of NP result from damage to thermo-nociceptive pathways (thin fibres and spino-thalamo-cortical systems), specific activation of these is critical to ensure diagnostic accuracy. This is currently achieved using laser pulses or contact heat stimuli, and in a near future probably also with contact cold and intra-epidermal low-intensity currents. Standard electrical stimuli, although of lesser diagnostic yield, are useful when large and small fibres are affected together. Nociceptive evoked potentials to laser (LEPs) and contact heat (CHEPs) have shown adequate sensitivity and specificity to be of clinical use in the differential diagnosis of NP, in conditions involving Aδ of C-fibres and spino-thalamo-cortical pathways. LEPs have also a role in the detection of patients at risk of developing central post-stroke pain after brainstem, thalamic or cortical injury. Cognitive cortical responses and autonomic reactions (sympathetic skin responses) reflect pain-related arousal and can document objectively positive symptoms such as allodynia and hyperalgesia. They are of help in the differential diagnosis of somatisation disorders, by discriminating conscious simulation (malingering) from conversive sensory loss. The electrophysiological approach to patients suspected, or at risk, of NP is a cost-effective procedure that should never be absent in the diagnostic armamentarium of pain clinics.","[""1 Inserm U1028, CNRS, UMR5292, central integration of pain (NeuroPain) Lab\xa0-\xa0Lyon neuroscience research center, université Claude Bernard, 69677 Bron, France; Centre d'évaluation et de traitement de la douleur, hôpital neurologique, 69000 Lyon, France.

Linearly and circularly polarized two-photon absorption (TPA) and time-resolved single- and two-photon fluorescence anisotropy measurements are used to determine the structure of the transition tensor in the deprotonated form of enhanced green fluorescent protein. For excitation wavelengths between 800 nm and 900 nm, TPA is best described by a single element, almost completely diagonal, two-dimensional (planar) transition tensor whose principal axis is collinear to that of the single-photon S0 → S1 transition moment. These observations are in accordance with assignments of the near-infrared two-photon absorption band in fluorescent proteins to a vibronically enhanced S0 → S1 transition.","['1 Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London, London WC1E 6BT, United Kingdom.', '2 Cell Biophysics Laboratory, Ikerbasque, Basque Foundation for Science and Unidad de Biofisica (CSIC-UPV/EHU), Bilbao, Spain.']","T A Masters, R J Marsh, T S Blacker, D A Armoogum, B Larijani, A J Bain, ",The Journal of chemical physics,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29626864
640,Anodal tDCS affects neuromodulatory effects of the norepinephrine system on superior frontal theta activity during response inhibition,"Medial and superior frontal theta oscillations are important for response inhibition. The norepinephrine (NE) system has been shown to modulate these oscillations possibly via gain control mechanisms, which depend on the modulation of neuron membrane potentials. Because the latter are also modulated by tDCS, the interrelation of tDCS and NE effects on superior frontal theta band activity needs investigation. We test the hypothesis that anodal tDCS affects modulatory effects of the NE system on theta band activity during inhibitory control in superior frontal regions. Using EEG beamforming, theta band activity in the superior frontal gyrus (SFG) was integrated (correlated) with the pupil diameter data as an indirect index of NE activity. In a within-subject design, healthy participants completed a response inhibition task in two sessions in which they received 2 mA anodal tDCS over the vertex, or sham stimulation. There were no behavioral effects of anodal tDCS. Yet, tDCS affected correlations between SFG theta band activity time course and the pupil diameter time course. Correlations were evident after sham stimulation (r = .701; p < .004), but absent after anodal tDCS. The observed power of this dissociation was above 95%. The data suggest that anodal tDCS may eliminate neuromodulatory effects, likely of the NE system, on theta band activity during response inhibition in a structure of the response inhibition network. The NE system and tDCS seem to target similar mechanisms important for cognitive control in the prefrontal cortex. The results provide a hint why tDCS often fails to induce overt behavioral effects and shows that neurobiological systems, which may exert similar effects as tDCS on neural processes should closely be monitored in tDCS experiments.","['1 Cognitive Neurophysiology, Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine Carl Gustav Carus, TU Dresden, Fetscherstrasse 74, 01307, Dresden, Germany.', '2 Department of Neurology, Faculty of Medicine, MS Centre Dresden, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', '3 Cognitive Neurophysiology, Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine Carl Gustav Carus, TU Dresden, Fetscherstrasse 74, 01307, Dresden, Germany. christian.beste@uniklinikum-dresden.de.']","Nico Adelhöfer, Moritz Mückschel, Benjamin Teufert, Tjalf Ziemssen, Christian Beste, ",Brain structure & function,2019 Apr,Anodal tDCS; Beamforming; EEG; Norepinephrine system; Pupil diameter; Superior frontal gyrus.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30701308

643,Ground truth construction and parameter tuning for the detection of sleep spindle timing in rodents,"Background:
      
    

    
      The precise detection of cortical sleep spindles is critical to basic research on memory consolidation in rodents. Previous research using automatic spindle detection algorithms often lacks systematic parameter variations and validations. New method:
      
    

    
      We present a method to systematically tune and validate algorithm parameters in automatic spindle detection algorithms using a moderate number of human raters. Results:
      
    

    
      Comparing a Hilbert transform-based algorithm to a ground truth constructed by six human raters, this method produced a parameter set yielding an F1 score of 0.82 at 10 ms resolution. The algorithm performance fell within the range of human agreement with the ground truth. Both human and algorithm failures arose largely from disagreement in spindle boundaries rather than spindle occurrence. With no additional tuning, the algorithm performed similarly in recordings from different days or rats. Comparison with existing methods:
      
    

    
      Most spindle detection algorithms do not perform systematic parameter variations and validation using a ground truth. To our knowledge, our study is the first in which rodent spindle data is scored by humans, and in which an automatic spindle detection algorithm is evaluated with respect to this ground truth. The rodent data from this study make it possible to compare our algorithm with others previously tested on human data. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We present a general ground truth based approach for the tuning and validation of spindle extraction algorithms and suggest that algorithms aimed at extracting precise spindle timing in rats should use a systematic approach for parameter tuning.","['1 Psychology Department, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, United States.', '2 Psychology Department, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, United States; Biomedical Engineering Department, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, United States; Program in Applied Mathematics, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, United States.

But for a long time it remained unclear what triggered the heart contractions.The Dutch physiologist Willem Einthoven registered the electrical processes in the contraction of the heart muscle and thus provided the first electrophysiological basis of cardiac muscle activity. Since 1903, Sunao Tawara was assistant to Ludwig Aschoff in Marburg. Both left Marburg in 1906: Tawara went back to Japan and Aschoff to Freiburg. In 1905, Tawara discovered the connections of the His' bundle to the AV node and the Purkinje fibers. At that time, there was no thought of a functional interpretation. Tawara discovered a kind of ""knot"" that linked to the adjacent myocardial cells, as well as the ""Tawara thighs"", which frayed and went into structures known as Purkinje fibers. Tawara detected the tree-like structure he had discovered as a muscle-fiber system that controlled the arousal of the heart's musculature. Thus the old dispute between myogenic and neurogenic arousal of the heart was decided in favor of the myogenic excitation conduction. The atrioventricular node described by Tawara was given the eponym ""Aschoff-Tawara node"".

647,Engineering a uniaxial substrate-stretching device for simultaneous electrophysiological measurements and imaging of strained peripheral neurons,"Peripheral nerves are continuously subjected to mechanical strain during everyday movements, but excessive stretch can lead to damage and neuronal cell functionality can also be impaired. To better understand cellular processes triggered by stretch, it is necessary to develop in vitro experimental methods that allow multiple concurrent measurements and replicate in vivo mechanical conditions. Current commercially available cell stretching devices do not allow flexible experimental design, restricting the range of possible multi-physics measurements. Here, we describe and characterise a custom-built uniaxial substrate-straining device, with which neurons cultured on aligned patterned surfaces (50 µm wide grooves) can be strained up to 70% and simultaneously imaged with widefield and confocal imaging (up to 100x magnification). Furthermore, direct and indirect electrophysiological measurements by patch clamping and calcium imaging can be made during strain application. We characterise the strain applied to cells cultured in deformable wells by using finite element method simulations and experimental data, showing local surface strains of up to 60% with applied strains of up to 25%. We also show how patterned substrates do not alter the mechanical properties of the system compared to unpatterned surfaces whilst still inducing a homogeneous cell response to strain. The characterisation of this device will be useful for research into investigating the effect of whole-cell mechanical stretch on neurons at both single cell and network scales, with applications found in peripheral neuropathy modelling and in platforms for preventive and regenerative studies.","['1 Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Dept. of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7DQ, UK.', '2 Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 3PJ, UK; Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.', '3 Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 3PJ, UK.', '4 Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Dept. of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7DQ, UK.

648,Attention amplifies neural representations of changes in sensory input at the expense of perceptual accuracy,"Attention enhances the neural representations of behaviorally relevant stimuli, typically by a push-pull increase of the neuronal response gain to attended vs. unattended stimuli. This selectively improves perception and consequently behavioral performance. However, to enhance the detectability of stimulus changes, attention might also distort neural representations, compromising accurate stimulus representation. We test this hypothesis by recording neural responses in the visual cortex of rhesus monkeys during a motion direction change detection task. We find that attention indeed amplifies the neural representation of direction changes, beyond a similar effect of adaptation. We further show that humans overestimate such direction changes, providing a perceptual correlate of our neurophysiological observations. Our results demonstrate that attention distorts the neural representations of abrupt sensory changes and consequently perceptual accuracy. This likely represents an evolutionary adaptive mechanism that allows sensory systems to flexibly forgo accurate representation of stimulus features to improve the encoding of stimulus change.","['1 Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory, German Primate Center - Leibniz Institute for Primate Research, Göttingen, 37077, Germany. v.mehrpour@gmail.com.', '2 Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience, Göttingen, Germany. v.mehrpour@gmail.com.', '3 Leibniz ScienceCampus Primate Cognition, Göttingen, Germany. v.mehrpour@gmail.com.', '4 Department of Psychology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA. v.mehrpour@gmail.com.', '5 Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada, N6A 5B7.', '6 Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory, German Primate Center - Leibniz Institute for Primate Research, Göttingen, 37077, Germany. treue@gwdg.de.', '7 Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience, Göttingen, Germany. treue@gwdg.de.', '8 Leibniz ScienceCampus Primate Cognition, Göttingen, Germany. treue@gwdg.de.', '9 Faculty for Biology and Psychology, University of Göttingen, Göttingen, Germany. treue@gwdg.de.']","Vahid Mehrpour, Julio C Martinez-Trujillo, Stefan Treue, ",Nature communications,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32358494

The detailed structure of SorCS2 and its extracellular specificity are unresolved. Here we report crystal structures of the SorCS2-NGF complex and unliganded SorCS2 ectodomain, revealing cross-braced SorCS2 homodimers with two NGF dimers bound in a 2:4 stoichiometry. Five out of six SorCS2 domains directly contribute to dimer formation and a C-terminal membrane proximal unreported domain, with an RNA recognition motif fold, locks the dimer in an intermolecular head-to-tail interaction. The complex structure shows an altered SorCS2 conformation indicating substantial structural plasticity. Both NGF dimer chains interact exclusively with the top face of a SorCS2 β-propeller. Biophysical experiments reveal that NGF, proNGF, and proBDNF bind at this site on SorCS2.

652,Inherent Biophysical Properties Modulate the Toxicity of Soluble Amyloidogenic Light Chains,"In light chain amyloidosis (AL), fibrillar deposition of monoclonal immunoglobulin light chains (LCs) in vital organs, such as heart, is associated with their severe dysfunction. In addition to the cellular damage caused by fibril deposition, direct toxicity of soluble prefibrillar amyloidogenic proteins has been reported, in particular, for cardiotoxicity. However, the molecular bases of proteotoxicity by soluble LCs have not been clarified. Here, to address this issue, we rationally engineered the amino acid sequence of the highly cardiotoxic LC H6 by introducing three residue mutations, designed to reduce the dynamics of its native state. The resulting mutant (mH6) is less toxic than its parent H6 to human cardiac fibroblasts and C. elegans. The high sequence and structural similarity, together with the different toxicity, make H6 and its non-toxic designed variant mH6 a test case to shed light on the molecular properties underlying soluble toxicity. Our comparative structural and biochemical study of H6 and mH6 shows closely matching crystal structures, whereas spectroscopic data and limited proteolysis indicate that H6 displays poorly cooperative fold, higher flexibility, and kinetic instability, and a higher dynamic state in its native fold. Taken together, the results of this study show a strong correlation between the overall conformational properties of the native fold and the proteotoxicity of cardiotropic LCs.","['1 Dipartimento di Bioscienze, Università Degli Studi di Milano, Via Celoria 26, 20133, Milano, Italy.', '2 Dipartimento di Biochimica Molecolare e Farmacologia Molecolare, Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri IRCCS, 20156, Milano, Italy.', '3 Centre for Misfolding Diseases, Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 1EW, United Kingdom.', '4 Amyloidosis Research and Treatment Center, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, and Dipartimento di Medicina Molecolare, Università di Pavia, Piazzale Golgi 19, 27100, Pavia, Italy; Department of Morphological and Physiological Sciences, Graduate School of Health Sciences, Kumamoto University, 4-24-1 Kuhonji, and Department of Neurology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, 1-1-1, Honjo, Kumamoto, Japan.', '5 Dipartimento di Fisiopatologia Medico-Chirurgica e Dei Trapianti, Università Degli Studi di Milano, Italy.', '6 Amyloidosis Research and Treatment Center, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, and Dipartimento di Medicina Molecolare, Università di Pavia, Piazzale Golgi 19, 27100, Pavia, Italy.', ""7 Dipartimento di Scienze per gli Alimenti, La Nutrizione e L'Ambiente, Università Degli Studi di Milano, 20133, Milano, Italy."", '8 Dipartimento di Bioscienze, Università Degli Studi di Milano, Via Celoria 26, 20133, Milano, Italy; Centro di Ricerca Pediatrica Romeo Ed Enrica Invernizzi, Università Degli Studi di Milano, Via Celoria 26, 20133, Milano, Italy.', '9 Amyloidosis Research and Treatment Center, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, and Dipartimento di Medicina Molecolare, Università di Pavia, Piazzale Golgi 19, 27100, Pavia, Italy.

653,Electrophysiology Catheter-Facilitated coronary sinus cannulation and implantation of cardiac resynchronization therapy systems,"Background:
      
    

    
      Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device implantation is hampered by difficult placement of the left ventricular (LV) lead. We have routinely used a steerable electrophysiology catheter to guide coronary sinus (CS) cannulation and facilitate LV lead positioning. The aim of this prospective study is to present our results with this approach in 138 consecutive patients receiving a CRT device over 10 years. Methods:
      
    

    
      The study included 120 men and 18 women, aged 64.8±11.4 years, with coronary disease (n=63), cardiomyopathy (n=72), or other disease (n=3), and mean ejection fraction of 24.5±4.5%. Devices were implanted for refractory heart failure and dyssynchrony, all but 2 in the presence of left bundle branch block. Implanted devices included biventricular pacemakers (CRT-P) (n=33) and cardioverter defibrillators (CRT-D) (n=105). Results:
      
    

    
      Using the electrophysiology catheter, the CS could be engaged in 134 (97.1%) patients. In 4 patients failing CS cannulation, a dual-chamber device was implanted in 2, and bifocal right ventricular pacing was effected in 2. Bifocal (n=2) or conventional (n=1) systems were implanted in another 3 patients, in whom the LV lead got dislodged (n=2) or removed because of local dissection (n=1). Thus, finally, a CRT system was successfully established in 131 (94.9%) patients. There were 3 patients with CS dissection, of whom 1 was complicated by cardiac tamponade managed with pericardiocentesis. There were no perioperative deaths. During follow-up (31.0±21.2 months), clinical improvement was reported by 108 (82.4%) patients. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Routine use of an electrophysiology catheter greatly facilitated CS cannulation and successful LV lead placement in ∼95% of patients undergoing CRT system implantation.","['1 Third Department of Cardiology, Athens University School of Medicine, Athens, Greece.

654,Free choice shapes normalized value signals in medial orbitofrontal cortex,"Normalization is a common cortical computation widely observed in sensory perception, but its importance in perception of reward value and decision making remains largely unknown. We examined (1) whether normalized value signals occur in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and (2) whether changes in behavioral task context influence the normalized representation of value. We record medial OFC (mOFC) single neuron activity in awake-behaving monkeys during a reward-guided lottery task. mOFC neurons signal the relative values of options via a divisive normalization function when animals freely choose between alternatives. The normalization model, however, performed poorly in a variant of the task where only one of the two possible choice options yields a reward and the other was certain not to yield a reward (so called: ""forced choice""). The existence of such context-specific value normalization may suggest that the mOFC contributes valuation signals critical for economic decision making when meaningful alternative options are available.","['1 Center for Neural Science, New York University, 4 Washington Place, Room 809, New York, New York, 10003, USA. h-yamada@md.tsukuba.ac.jp.', '2 Division of Biomedical Science, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tenno-dai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8577, Japan. h-yamada@md.tsukuba.ac.jp.', '3 Graduate School of Comprehensive Human Sciences, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tenno-dai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8577, Japan. h-yamada@md.tsukuba.ac.jp.', '4 Transborder Medical Research Center, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tenno-dai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8577, Japan. h-yamada@md.tsukuba.ac.jp.', '5 Center for Neural Science, New York University, 4 Washington Place, Room 809, New York, New York, 10003, USA.', '6 School of Economics, University of Sydney, Room 370, Merewether Building (H04), Sydney, New South Wales, 2006, Australia.', '7 Institute for the Interdisciplinary Study of Decision Making, New York University, 300 Cadman Plaza West, Suite 702, Brooklyn, New York, 11201, USA.']","Hiroshi Yamada, Kenway Louie, Agnieszka Tymula, Paul W Glimcher, ",Nature communications,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29323110
655,The Vienna psychosocial assessment procedure for bionic reconstruction in patients with global brachial plexus injuries,"Background:
      
    

    
      Global brachial plexopathies cause major sensory and motor deficits in the affected arm and hand. Many patients report of psychosocial consequences including chronic pain, decreased self-sufficiency, and poor body image. Bionic reconstruction, which includes the amputation and prosthetic replacement of the functionless limb, has been shown to restore hand function in patients where classic reconstructions have failed. Patient selection and psychological evaluation before such a life-changing procedure are crucial for optimal functional outcomes. In this paper we describe a psychosocial assessment procedure for bionic reconstruction in patients with complete brachial plexopathies and present psychosocial outcome variables associated with bionic reconstruction. Methods:
      
    

    
      Between 2013 and 2017 psychosocial assessments were performed in eight patients with global brachial plexopathies. We conducted semi-structured interviews exploring the psychosocial adjustment related to the accident, the overall psychosocial status, as well as motivational aspects related to an anticipated amputation and expectations of functional prosthetic outcome. During the interview patients were asked to respond freely. Their answers were transcribed verbatim by the interviewer and analyzed afterwards on the basis of a pre-defined item scoring system. The interview was augmented by quantitative evaluation of self-reported mental health and social functioning (SF-36 Health Survey), body image (FKB-20) and deafferentation pain (VAS). Additionally, psychosocial outcome variables were presented for seven patients before and after bionic reconstruction. Results:
      
    

    
      Qualitative data revealed several psychological stressors with long-term negative effects on patients with complete brachial plexopathies. 88% of patients felt functionally limited to a great extent due to their disability, and all of them reported constant, debilitating pain in the deafferented hand. After bionic reconstruction the physical component summary scale increased from 30.80 ± 5.31 to 37.37 ± 8.41 (p-value = 0.028), the mental component summary scale improved from 43.19 ± 8.32 to 54.76 ± 6.78 (p-value = 0.018). VAS scores indicative of deafferentation pain improved from 7.8 to 5.6 after prosthetic hand replacement (p-value = 0.018). Negative body evaluation improved from 60.71 ± 12.12 to 53.29 ± 11.03 (p-value = 0.075). Vital body dynamics increased from 38.57 ± 13.44 to 44.43 ± 16.15 (p-value = 0.109). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Bionic reconstruction provides hope for patients with complete brachial plexopathies who have lived without hand function for years or even decades. Critical patient selection is crucial and the psychosocial assessment procedure including a semi-structured interview helps identify unresolved psychological issues, which could preclude or delay bionic reconstruction. Bionic reconstruction improves overall quality of life, restores an intact self-image and reduces deafferentation pain.","['1 Christian Doppler Laboratory for Restoration of Extremity Function, Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Department of Surgery, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', '2 General Hospital of Vienna, Department of Clinical Psychology, Vienna, Austria.', '3 Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Department of Surgery, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', '4 Health Assisting Engineering, University of Applied Sciences FH Campus, Vienna, Austria.']","Laura Antonia Hruby, Anna Pittermann, Agnes Sturma, Oskar Christian Aszmann, ",PloS one,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29298304

657,Fabrication and Characterization of Optical Tissue Phantoms Containing Macrostructure,"The rapid development of new optical imaging techniques is dependent on the availability of low-cost, customizable, and easily reproducible standards. By replicating the imaging environment, costly animal experiments to validate a technique may be circumvented. Predicting and optimizing the performance of in vivo and ex vivo imaging techniques requires testing on samples that are optically similar to tissues of interest. Tissue-mimicking optical phantoms provide a standard for evaluation, characterization, or calibration of an optical system. Homogenous polymer optical tissue phantoms are widely used to mimic the optical properties of a specific tissue type within a narrow spectral range. Layered tissues, such as the epidermis and dermis, can be mimicked by simply stacking these homogenous slab phantoms. However, many in vivo imaging techniques are applied to more spatially complex tissue where three dimensional structures, such as blood vessels, airways, or tissue defects, can affect the performance of the imaging system. This protocol describes the fabrication of a tissue-mimicking phantom that incorporates three-dimensional structural complexity using material with optical properties of tissue. Look-up tables provide India ink and titanium dioxide recipes for optical absorption and scattering targets. Methods to characterize and tune the material optical properties are described. The phantom fabrication detailed in this article has an internal branching mock airway void; however, the technique can be broadly applied to other tissue or organ structures.","['1 Department of Biomedical Engineering, Texas A&M University.', '2 Deparment of Molecular Pathogenesis and Immunology, Texas A&M College of Medicine.', '3 Department of Biomedical Engineering, Texas A&M University; kmaitland@tamu.edu.']","Madeleine S Durkee, Landon D Nash, Fatemeh Nooshabadi, Jeffrey D Cirillo, Duncan J Maitland, Kristen C Maitland, ",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29553502
658,Cell Line Classification Using Electric Cell-Substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS),"We present new methods for cell line classification using multivariate time series bioimpedance data obtained from electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) technology. The ECIS technology, which monitors the attachment and spreading of mammalian cells in real time through the collection of electrical impedance data, has historically been used to study one cell line at a time. However, we show that if applied to data from multiple cell lines, ECIS can be used to classify unknown or potentially mislabeled cells, factors which have previously been associated with the reproducibility crisis in the biological literature. We assess a range of approaches to this new problem, testing different classification methods and deriving a dictionary of 29 features to characterize ECIS data. Most notably, our analysis enriches the current field by making use of simultaneous multi-frequency ECIS data, where previous studies have focused on only one frequency; using classification methods to distinguish multiple cell lines, rather than simple statistical tests that compare only two cell lines; and assessing a range of features derived from ECIS data based on their classification performance. In classification tests on fifteen mammalian cell lines, we obtain very high out-of-sample predictive accuracy. These preliminary findings provide a baseline for future large-scale studies in this field.","['1 Department of Statistics and Data Science, Cornell University, NY Ithaca, USA.', '2 Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Williams College, MA Williamstown, USA.']","Megan L Gelsinger, Laura L Tupper, David S Matteson, ",The international journal of biostatistics,2019,biophysics; classification analysis; supervised learning.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31811802

In the inpatient setting, ILRs are routinely implanted in the electrophysiology (EP) lab despite the low complication rate. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety, feasibility, and cost of implanting ILRs at the patient's bedside by both electrophysiologists and advanced practice providers (APPs). This was a single center, retrospective study of consecutive ILR implantations performed from February 2018 to May 2019. We examined 3 groups: implantations in the EP lab by electrophysiologists (EP Lab/MD), implantations at the bedside by electrophysiologists (Floor/MD), and implantations at the bedside by APPs (Floor/APP). Over 15 months, 152 patients underwent ILR implantation: 48 in the EP Lab/MD group, 57 in the Floor/MD group, and 47 in the Floor/APP group. The procedure duration was longer in the Floor/APP group (14.2 ± 5.9 minutes) compared with the EP Lab/MD and Floor/MD groups (6.8 ± 4.3 minutes, 9.1 ± 4.9 minutes, p <0.001). The overall complication rate was low (2.6%) with no differences between the groups (p = 0.83).

Here, we present a case study as a comprehensive short history of this process based on extensive studies conducted at NeuroGroup (University of Tampere) and Computational Biophysics and Imaging Group (Tampere University of Technology), ranging from the differentiation and culturing of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived neuronal networks to their electrophysiological analysis. After an introduction to neuronal differentiation in hPSCs, we review our work on their functionality and approaches for extending cultures from 2D to 3D systems. Thereafter, we discuss our target applications in neuronal developmental modeling, toxicology, drug screening, and disease modeling. The development of signal analysis methods was required due to the unique functional and developmental properties of hPSC-derived neuronal cells and networks, which separate them from their much-used rodent counterparts. Accordingly, a line of microelectrode array (MEA) signal analysis methods was developed. This work included the development of action potential spike detection methods, entropy-based methods and additional methods for burst detection and quantification, joint analysis of spikes and bursts to analyze the spike waveform compositions of bursts, assessment methods for network synchronization, and computational simulations of synapses and neuronal networks.","['1 NeuroGroup, Faculty of Medicine and Health Technology, Tampere University, Tampere, Finland.', '2 Computational Biophysics and Imaging Group, Faculty of Medicine and Health Technology, Tampere University, Tampere, Finland.', '3 Danish Research Institute of Translational Neuroscience - DANDRITE, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.', '4 Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.', '5 NeuroGroup, Faculty of Medicine and Health Technology, Tampere University, Tampere, Finland. susanna.narkilahti@tuni.fi.']","Laura Ylä-Outinen, Jarno M A Tanskanen, Fikret E Kapucu, Anu Hyysalo, Jari A K Hyttinen, Susanna Narkilahti, ",Advances in neurobiology,2019,Human neurons; Human pluripotent stem cells; Microelectrode arrays; Signal analysis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31073942

The FNR produced N170 and P100 components at posterior, and an N100 component at anterior electrodes. Posterior P200, anterior N200 components were recorded during JOL and FOK judgments. Our data showed that ERP correlates of JOL and FOK emerge as rapidly as 200 ms following stimulus presentation, and these two metacognitive judgments are based on both perceptual fluency and conflict processes. However, these ERP components affected by the degree of JOL and FOK judgments. Thus, we concluded that even though JOL and FOK judgments produced similar ERP wave forms temporal dynamics of these two judgments are different. Also, our results support the hypothesis that metacognitive judgments are linked to distributed neural substrates rather than strictly to frontal lobe function.","['1 Department of Psychology, Bahçeşehir University, Istanbul, Turkey.', '2 Institute of Psychology, Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.']","Metehan Irak, Can Soylu, Gözem Turan, ",Cognitive neuropsychology,Oct-Dec 2019,Judgment of learning; event-related potentials; face-name recognition; feeling of knowing; metacognition.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31928316

666,Metabolomics for Animal Models of Rare Human Diseases: An Expert Review and Lessons Learned,"Rare diseases occur with a frequency ≤1:1500-1:2500 depending on the location and applicable definitions across countries. Although individually rare, they collectively affect as much as 4-8% of population imposing a large burden on public health. Rarity in prevalence means prolonged path to accurate diagnosis, lack of treatment options, and also limited chances for preclinical studies of pathogenesis. I discuss in this expert review (1) what metabolomics, as a high throughput systems sciences technology, offers for rare disease studies, (2) why animal models are important for the study of rare human diseases and what should be kept in mind while using animal models, and finally, (3) provide examples of recent research to highlight how metabolomics on animal models of rare diseases perform, and how these results can lead to the knowhow, which raises genome, metabolome, and phenotype integration to a whole new level. In sum, metabolomics has been for years in clinical use for diagnosis of certain types of rare diseases. Determination of pathogenesis of more complex diseases and testing of treatment strategies is where animal models and systems biology analytical approaches are necessary. From gathered data, it is possible to go back to diagnostic and prognostic markers for rare diseases, which so far lack reliable and robust diagnosis and therapeutic options. In the future, a major challenge is to reveal the links between genotype, metabolism, and phenotype. Rare diseases could be the key in that process.","['1 Department of Biochemistry, Institute of Biomedicine and Translational Medicine, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.']","Kalle Kilk, ",Omics : a journal of integrative biology,2019 Jun,animal models; biomarkers; diagnostics; metabolomics; rare diseases; translational medicine.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31120384

Twenty-nine male adults participated in the study, which involved 5 separate experiments. Experiments 1 to 3 assessed the effect of conditioning stimulus (CS) intensity (60, 70, 80 and 90% active motor threshold, AMT), contraction strength (5, 10, 20 and 50% maximum voluntary contraction, MVC), and inter-stimulus interval (ISI, 2-5 ms for short-interval intracortical inhibition, SICI and 10-15 ms for intracortical facilitation, ICF) on SICI and ICF. In Experiment 4, 30 measurements of corticospinal excitability (CSE), SICI and ICF were recorded, with the minimum number of consecutive measurements required as a probability of falling within the 95% CI determined. In Experiment 5, within- and between-day reliability of CSE, SICI and ICF was assessed. The results suggest that for SICI, a CS of 70% AMT, ISI of 2 ms, and contraction strength of 5 or 10% MVC induces the greatest level of inhibition. Negligible differences in ICF were seen across stimulus variables. The minimum number of measurements required to obtain an accurate estimate of CSE, SICI and ICF was 21, 18 and 17, respectively. Using the optimal stimulus variables and number of measurements, CSE, SICI and ICF can be measured reliably both within- and between-days (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC ≥ 0.87, ≥0.74, and ≥0.61, respectively).

669,Dynamic Bioreactors with Integrated Microfabricated Devices for Mechanobiological Screening,"Biomechanical stimulation is a common strategy to improve the growth, maturation, and function of a variety of engineered tissues. However, identifying optimized biomechanical conditioning protocols is challenging, as cell responses to mechanical stimuli are modulated by other multifactorial microenvironmental cues, including soluble factors and biomaterial properties. Traditional bioreactors lack the throughput necessary for combinatorial testing of cell activity in mechanically stimulated engineered tissues. Microfabricated systems can improve experimental throughput, but often do not provide uniform mechanical loading, are challenging to use, lack robustness, and offer limited amounts of cells and tissue for analysis. To address the need for higher-throughput, combinatorial testing of cell activity in a tissue engineering context, we developed a hybrid approach, in which flexible polydimethylsiloxane microfabricated inserts were designed to simultaneously generate multiple tensile strains when stretched cyclically in a standard dynamic bioreactor. In the embodiment presented in this study, each insert contained an array of 35 dog bone-shaped wells in which cell-seeded microscale hydrogels can be polymerized, with up to eight inserts stretched simultaneously in the bioreactor. Uniformity of the applied strains, both along the length of a microtissue and across multiple microtissues at the same strain level, was confirmed experimentally. In proof-of-principle experiments, the combinatorial effects of dynamic strain, biomaterial stiffness, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 stimulation on myofibroblast differentiation were tested, revealing both known and novel interaction effects and suggesting tissue engineering strategies to regulate myofibroblast activation. This platform is expected to have wide applicability in systematically probing combinations of mechanobiological tissue engineering parameters for desired effects on cell fate and tissue function. Impact Statement In this study, we introduce a dynamic bioreactor system incorporating microfabricated inserts to enable systematic probing of the effects of combinations of mechanobiological parameters on engineered tissues. This novel platform offers the ease of use, robustness, and well-defined mechanical strain stimuli inherent in traditional dynamic bioreactors, but significantly improves throughput (up to 280 microtissues can be tested simultaneously in the embodiment presented in this study). This platform has wide applicability to systematically probe combinations of dynamic mechanical strain, biomaterial properties, biochemical stimulation, and other parameters for desired effects on cell fate and engineered tissue development.","['1 Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', '2 Institute of Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', '3 Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', '4 Translational Biology and Engineering Program, Ted Rogers Centre for Heart Research, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', '5 Department of Chemical Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, Canada.']","Bogdan M Beca, Yu Sun, Edwin Wong, Christopher Moraes, Craig A Simmons, ","Tissue engineering.

670,Biaxial biomechanical properties of the nonpregnant murine cervix and uterus,"From a biomechanical perspective, female reproductive health is an understudied area of research. There is an incomplete understanding of the complex function and interaction between the cervix and uterus. This, in part, is due to the limited research into multiaxial biomechanical functions and geometry of these organs. Knowledge of the biomechanical function and interaction between these organs may elucidate etiologies of conditions such as preterm birth. Therefore, the objective of this study was to quantify the multiaxial biomechanical properties of the murine cervix and uterus using a biaxial testing set-up. To accomplish this, an inflation-extension testing protocol (n = 15) was leveraged to quantify biaxial biomechanical properties while preserving native matrix interactions and geometry. Ultrasound imaging and histology (n = 10) were performed to evaluate regional geometry and microstructure, respectively. Histological analysis identified a statistically significant greater collagen content and significantly smaller smooth muscle content in the cervix as compared to the uterus. No statistically significant differences in elastic fibers were identified. Analysis of bilinear fits revealed a significantly stiffer response from the circumferentially orientated ECM fibers compared to axially orientated fibers in both organs. Bilinear fits and a two-fiber family constitutive model showed that the cervix was significantly less distensible than the uterus. We submit that the regional biaxial information reported in this study aids in establishing an appropriate reference configuration for mathematical models of the uterine-cervical complex. Thus, may aid future work to elucidate the biomechanical mechanisms leading to cervical or uterine conditions.","['1 Department of Biomedical Engineering, Tulane University, 6823 St. Charles Ave, New Orleans, LA 70118, USA.

672,Toward Electrophysiology-Based Intelligent Adaptive Deep Brain Stimulation for Movement Disorders,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) represents one of the major clinical breakthroughs in the age of translational neuroscience. In 1987, Benabid and colleagues demonstrated that high-frequency stimulation can mimic the effects of ablative neurosurgery in Parkinson's disease (PD), while offering two key advantages to previous procedures: adjustability and reversibility. Deep brain stimulation is now an established therapeutic approach that robustly alleviates symptoms in patients with movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, and dystonia, who present with inadequate or adverse responses to medication. Currently, stimulation electrodes are implanted in specific target regions of the basal ganglia-thalamic circuit and stimulation pulses are delivered chronically. To achieve optimal therapeutic effect, stimulation frequency, amplitude, and pulse width must be adjusted on a patient-specific basis by a movement disorders specialist. The finding that pathological neural activity can be sampled directly from the target region using the DBS electrode has inspired a novel DBS paradigm: closed-loop adaptive DBS (aDBS). The goal of this strategy is to identify pathological and physiologically normal patterns of neuronal activity that can be used to adapt stimulation parameters to the concurrent therapeutic demand. This review will give detailed insight into potential biomarkers and discuss next-generation strategies, implementing advances in artificial intelligence, to further elevate the therapeutic potential of DBS by capitalizing on its modifiable nature. Development of intelligent aDBS, with an ability to deliver highly personalized treatment regimens and to create symptom-specific therapeutic strategies in real-time, could allow for significant further improvements in the quality of life for movement disorders patients with DBS that ultimately could outperform traditional drug treatment.","['1 Movement Disorder and Neuromodulation Unit, Department of Neurology, Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Campus Charite Mitte, Chariteplatz 1, 10117, Berlin, Germany. julian.neumann@charite.de.', '2 Department of Neurobiology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', '3 Department of Computer Science, Technische Universität Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', '4 Machine Learning Department, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', '5 Movement Disorder and Neuromodulation Unit, Department of Neurology, Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Campus Charite Mitte, Chariteplatz 1, 10117, Berlin, Germany.', '6 Berlin School of Mind and Brain, Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', '7 Neurocure, Centre of Excellence, Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', '8 Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.']","Wolf-Julian Neumann, Robert S Turner, Benjamin Blankertz, Tom Mitchell, Andrea A Kühn, R Mark Richardson, ",Neurotherapeutics : the journal of the American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics,2019 Jan,Basal ganglia; Closed-loop DBS; Deep brain stimulation; Dystonia; Parkinson’s disease; Tourette syndrome.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30607748

674,Towards enhanced metabolomic data analysis of mass spectrometry image: Multivariate Curve Resolution and Machine Learning,"Large amounts of data are generally produced from mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) experiments in obtaining the molecular and spatial information of biological samples. Traditionally, MS images are constructed using manually selected ions, and it is very challenging to comprehensively analyze MSI results due to their large data sizes and highly complex data structures. To overcome these barriers, it is obligatory to develop advanced data analysis approaches to handle the increasingly large MSI data. In the current study, we focused on the method development of using Multivariate Curve Resolution (MCR) and Machine Learning (ML) approaches. We aimed to effectively extract the essential information present in the large and complex MSI data and enhance the metabolomic data analysis of biological tissues. Multivariate Curve Resolution-Alternating Least Squares (MCR-ALS) algorithm was used to obtain major patterns of spatial distribution and grouped metabolites with the same spatial distribution patterns. In addition, both supervised and unsupervised ML methods were established to analyze the MSI data. In the supervised ML approach, Random Forest method was selected, and the model was trained using the selected datasets based on the distribution pattern obtained from MCR-ALS analyses. In the unsupervised ML approach, both DBSCAN (Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) and CLARA (Clustering Large Applications) were applied to cluster the MSI datasets. It is worth noting that similar patterns of spatial distribution were discovered through MSI data analysis using MCR-ALS, supervised ML, and unsupervised ML. Our protocols of data analysis can be applied to process the data acquired using many other types of MSI techniques, and to extract the overall features present in MSI results that are intractable using traditional data analysis approaches.","['1 Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Oklahoma, 101 Stephenson Parkway, Norman, OK, 73019, USA.', '2 Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Oklahoma, 101 Stephenson Parkway, Norman, OK, 73019, USA.

675,The Natural Compound Cinnamaldehyde is a Novel Activator of Calcium-Activated Chloride Channel,"Calcium-activated chloride channels (CaCCs) play important roles in a multitude of physiological processes, and in many cells types, TMEM16A was identified as the molecular basis of CaCC. Abnormal CaCC function has been implicated in variety of diseases, which reinforces the need for modulators of CaCCs/TMEM16A. However, there are few specific, clinical modulators of CaCCs. Here, we identified a potent novel activator of TMEM16A from a bank of traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) and explored its mechanism of activation by laser confocal scanning microscopy and patch clamping. Fluorescence data demonstrated that among the 36 tested TCM medicines, one compound, cinnamaldehyde (CA), can activate the TMEM16A channel in a dose-dependent manner. To determine the mechanism by which CA activates the TMEM16A channel, we performed an excised patch clamp experiment and measured the intracellular calcium concentration in fluorescence experiments. Our data show that CA activates TMEM16A channels by elevating the intracellular concentrations of calcium ions. The results of the whole-cell patch clamping showed that CA dose-dependently activates these channels, with an EC50 of 9.73 ± 5.64 µM at + 80 mV, and prolongs the deactivation of TMEM16A. Finally, we found that CA can strengthen contractions of the ileum in guinea pigs by activating TMEM16A. The results demonstrate that CA is a novel, natural activator of TMEM16A.","['1 Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics, Institute of Biophysics, School of Sciences, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, 300401, China.', '2 State Key Laboratory of Reliability and Intelligence of Electrical Equipment, School of Electrical Engineering, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, 300401, China.', '3 State Key Laboratory of Reliability and Intelligence of Electrical Equipment, School of Electrical Engineering, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, 300401, China. hailong_an@hebut.edu.cn.', '4 Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics, Institute of Biophysics, School of Sciences, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, 300401, China. hailong_an@hebut.edu.cn.']","Yayue Huang, Shuai Guo, Shuxi Ren, Yafei Chen, Yong Zhan, Hailong An, ",The Journal of membrane biology,2018 Dec,Activator of CaCC/TMEM16A; Cinnamaldehyde; Drug discovery; Electrophysiology; Fluorescent imaging.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30382294
676,Co-extraction for Metabolomics and Proteomics from a Single CSF Sample,"In the field of neurodegeneration, it is important to identify biomarkers that enable early disease prediction, since these disorders start decades before clinical symptoms manifest. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is considered an excellent source for biomarker discovery since it is in direct contact with the extracellular space of the brain and directly reflects disease-specific changes.While the liquor drainage is no major risk factor for patients, it is still not as easy and popular as simple blood sampling and less liquid can be collected. Especially when a variety of experiments for one cohort is planned, the volume of CSF can be a limiting factor. Therefore, it is essential that extraction and analytical methods are adapted to low amounts of liquor. If in follow-up studies, additional replicates to increase statistical significance or different extraction approaches are planned, the required amounts have to be minimized.With this extraction method, a combined proteomics and metabolomics approach is possible. This opportunity implies a variety of advantages. First, a classification matrix based on the comprehensive data set has a potentially higher accuracy even without a deeper understanding of the biological meaning of the different omics changes. If the proteome and metabolome differences can be linked to each other, this approach can conceivably open so far unknown doors regarding the cause or progression of different diseases like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease.","['1 Department of Bioinformatics and Biochemistry, Braunschweig Integrated Centre of Systems Biology (BRICS), Technische Universität Braunschweig, Braunschweig, Germany.', '2 Medizinisches Proteom-Center, Medical Faculty, Ruhr-University Bochum, Bochum, Germany.', '3 Medizinisches Proteom-Center, Medical Faculty, Ruhr-Universitðt Bochum, Bochum, Germany.', '4 Department of Bioinformatics and Biochemistry, Braunschweig Integrated Centre of Systems Biology (BRICS), Technische Universität Braunschweig, Braunschweig, Germany. karsten.hiller@tu-bs.de.', '5 Computational Biology of Infection Research, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Braunschweig, Germany. karsten.hiller@tu-bs.de.']","Philipp Hörmann, Katalin Barkovits, Katrin Marcus, Karsten Hiller, ","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2019,Derivatization; Gas chromatography; In-solution digest; Liquid chromatography; Metabolomics; Methanol precipitation.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31432423

679,The Power of LC-MS Based Multiomics: Exploring Adipogenic Differentiation of Human Mesenchymal Stem/Stromal Cells,"The molecular study of fat cell development in the human body is essential for our understanding of obesity and related diseases. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC) are the ideal source to study fat formation as they are the progenitors of adipocytes. In this work, we used human MSCs, received from surgery waste, and differentiated them into fat adipocytes. The combination of several layers of information coming from lipidomics, metabolomics and proteomics enabled network analysis of the biochemical pathways in adipogenesis. Simultaneous analysis of metabolites, lipids, and proteins in cell culture is challenging due to the compound's chemical difference, so most studies involve separate analysis with unimolecular strategies. In this study, we employed a multimolecular approach using a two-phase extraction to monitor the crosstalk between lipid metabolism and protein-based signaling in a single sample (~105 cells). We developed an innovative analytical workflow including standardization with in-house produced 13C isotopically labeled compounds, hyphenated high-end mass spectrometry (high-resolution Orbitrap MS), and chromatography (HILIC, RP) for simultaneous untargeted screening and targeted quantification. Metabolite and lipid concentrations ranged over three to four orders of magnitude and were detected down to the low fmol (absolute on column) level. Biological validation and data interpretation of the multiomics workflow was performed based on proteomics network reconstruction, metabolic modelling (MetaboAnalyst 4.0), and pathway analysis (OmicsNet). Comparing MSCs and adipocytes, we observed significant regulation of different metabolites and lipids such as triglycerides, gangliosides, and carnitine with 113 fully reprogrammed pathways. The observed changes are in accordance with literature findings dealing with adipogenic differentiation of MSC. These results are a proof of principle for the power of multimolecular extraction combined with orthogonal LC-MS assays and network construction. Considering the analytical and biological validation performed in this study, we conclude that the proposed multiomics workflow is ideally suited for comprehensive follow-up studies on adipogenesis and is fit for purpose for different applications with a high potential to understand the complex pathophysiology of diseases.","['1 Institute of Analytical Chemistry, University of Vienna, Währinger Str. 38, 1090 Vienna, Austria. evelyn.rampler@univie.ac.at.', '2 Vienna Metabolomics Center (VIME), University of Vienna, Althanstraße 14, 1090 Vienna, Austria. evelyn.rampler@univie.ac.at.', '3 Chemistry Meets Microbiology, Althanstraße 14, 1090 Vienna, Austria. evelyn.rampler@univie.ac.at.', '4 Institute for Cell and Tissue Culture Technologies, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Muthgasse 18, 1190 Vienna, Austria. dominik.egger@boku.ac.at.', '5 Institute of Analytical Chemistry, University of Vienna, Währinger Str. 38, 1090 Vienna, Austria. harald.schoeny@univie.ac.at.', '6 Institute of Analytical Chemistry, University of Vienna, Währinger Str. 38, 1090 Vienna, Austria. mate.rusz@univie.ac.at.', '7 LMU München, Department Biology I, Großhaderner Str. 2-4, 82152 Planegg-Martinsried, Germany.

680,ON THE CONVERSION COEFFICIENT FROM AIR KERMA TO AMBIENT DOSE EQUIVALENT VALID FOR A CS-137 PHOTON FIELD-A CRITICAL REVIEW,"In radiation protection, the quantity ambient dose equivalent, in short H*(10), is very important in the field of area dosimetry, because this quantity is used to estimate the effective dose to human beings, whose permissible limits are restricted by law. The conversion coefficient from air kerma to H*(10), valid for a 137Cs photon field, is essential as it enters the realization of the quantity H*(10) as well as every (directly or indirectly) related calibration. The basic calibration factor of any dose rate instrument is usually related to a calibration in a 137Cs photon field, which underlines the importance of the conversion coefficient discussed in this article. Because different values of this coefficient are used in different calibration facilities, a harmonized best value will be proposed based on detailed investigations on the origin of the values recommended in the past. The newly recommended value differs by almost 1% from the value used by most institutes, at the moment, which is large in comparison with the typical uncertainties in primary fields. The goal of this article is to interpret known ICRU/ICRP data adequately, not to calculate new data.","['1 Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), Bundesallee 100, Braunschweig, Germany.']","H Dombrowski, ",Radiation protection dosimetry,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29939327

      Electrical methods and open-chamber evaporimeters for measurement of TEWL are still the preferred techniques to measure the water balance in the stratum corneum. The background technology and biophysics of these instruments remain relevant and valid. However, new methods that can image surface hydration and measure depth profiles of dermal water content now available. Open-chamber measurement of TEWL has been supplemented with semiopen and closed chamber probes, which are more robust to environmental influence and therefore convenient to use and more applicable to field studies. However, closed chamber methods interfere with the evaporation of water, and the methods cannot be used for continuous monitoring. Validation of methods with respect to intra- and inter-instrument variation remains challenging. No validation standard or test phantom is available. Results and conclusions:

Here, we report a dynamic covalent self-assembly process that mitigates kinetic trapping such that multiple unique oligomers bearing covalently coreactive pendant groups are able to undergo simultaneous, sequence-selective hybridization with their complementary strands to afford biomimetic, in-registry molecular ladders with covalent rungs. Analogous to the thermal cycling commonly employed for nucleic acid melting and annealing, this is achieved by raising and lowering the concentration of a multi-role reagent to effect quantitative dissociation and subsequently catalyze covalent bond rearrangement, affording selective assembly of the oligomeric sequences.

686,Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) Trial Outcomes After Conversion to a Multiple Waveform SCS System,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) for chronic intractable pain is typically delivered in pulses, classically programmed between approximately 20 and 100 Hz. Though some recent studies suggest that better pain relief is obtained, with only 10 kHz stimulation, other studies show that single-therapy trials do not always lead to permanent implantation. We evaluated SCS outcomes in subjects given trials with multiple waveforms who did not experience satisfactory trial relief with 10 kHz stimulation only. Methods:
      
    

    
      In this multicenter, open-label, real-world, observational study conducted in the United States, subjects reporting <50% pain relief with 10 kHz stimulation (i.e., failed the screening trial) received a stimulator capable of delivering multiple waveforms and/or field shapes. Pain relief and patient device preference data were collected. Results:
      
    

    
      Twenty-two subjects were analyzed. Of the 16 who failed the 10 kHz trial and had numerical rating scale, visual analog scale, or percent pain relief scores available, 63% (n = 10) reported ≥50% relief with multiple waveform SCS. Additionally, 80% of subjects with ≥50% relief using multiple waveform SCS had experienced no relief with 10 kHz SCS. Among all subjects, 68% preferred multiple waveform SCS, none preferred 10 kHz SCS, and 32% had no preference. Discussion:
      
    

    
      Subjects with failed SCS trials at 10 kHz experienced ≥50% relief after switching to a multiple waveform system. These results suggest that providing multiple waveforms during trials may overcome limitations of providing only 10 kHz stimulation. Thus, chronic pain's variable nature across patients and over time lends itself to variable treatment options.","['1 Spine and Skeletal Pain Medicine, Utica, NY, USA.', '2 Advanced Diagnostic Pain Treatment Centers, New Haven, CT, USA.', '3 Quave Clinic, Medford, OR, USA.', '4 Crystal Coast Pain Management, New Bern, NC, USA.', '5 Space City Pain Specialists, Webster, TX, USA.', ""6 Department of Anesthesiology, Center for Clinical Research and Carolina's Pain Institute, Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, NC, USA."", '7 Coastal Pain Research, Carlsbad, CA, USA.', '8 NeuroSpine Institute, Eugene, OR, USA.', '9 Clinical Research Department, Division of Neuromodulation, Boston Scientific Corporation, Valencia, CA, USA.']","Nameer Haider, Dwight Ligham, Brett Quave, Kirk E Harum, Eduardo A Garcia, Christopher A Gilmore, Nathan Miller, Gregory A Moore, Amarpreet Bains, Kristen Lechleiter, Roshini Jain, ",Neuromodulation : journal of the International Neuromodulation Society,2018 Jul,10 kHz; chronic pain; multiple waveforms; precision spectra; spinal cord stimulation.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29889356

Here we report two-photon laser scanning endomicroscope for in vivo cellular and tissue imaging using a Lissajous fiber scanner. The fiber scanner consists of a piezoelectric (PZT) tube, a single double-clad fiber (DCF) with high fluorescence collection, and a micro-tethered-silicon-oscillator (MTSO) for the separation of biaxial resonant scanning frequencies. The endomicroscopic imaging exhibits 5 frames/s with 99% in scanning density by using the selection rule of scanning frequencies. The endomicroscopic scanner was compactly packaged within a stainless tube of 2.6 mm in diameter with a high NA gradient-index (GRIN) lens, which can be easily inserted into the working channel of a conventional laparoscope. The lateral and axial resolutions of the endomicroscope are 0.70 µm and 7.6 μm, respectively. Two-photon fluorescence images of a stained kidney section and miscellaneous ex vivo and in vivo organs from wild type and green fluorescent protein transgenic (GFP-TG) mice were successfully obtained by using the endomicroscope. The endomicroscope also obtained label free images including autofluorescence and second-harmonic generation of an ear tissue of Thy1-GCaMP6 (GP5.17) mouse. The Lissajous scanning two-photon endomicroscope can provide a compact handheld platform for in vivo tissue imaging or optical biopsy applications.","['1 Department of Bio and Brain Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, 34141, Republic of Korea.', '2 KAIST Institute of Health science and technology, Daejeon, 34141, Republic of Korea.', '3 Biomedical Science and Engineering Interdisciplinary Program, KAIST, Daejeon, 34141, Republic of Korea.', '4 Department of Biological Sciences, KAIST, Daejeon, 34141, Republic of Korea.', '5 KAIST Institute for the BioCentury, Daejeon, 34141, Republic of Korea.', '6 Department of Bio and Brain Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, 34141, Republic of Korea. kjeong@kaist.ac.kr.', '7 KAIST Institute of Health science and technology, Daejeon, 34141, Republic of Korea. kjeong@kaist.ac.kr.']","Daniel Youngsuk Kim, Kyungmin Hwang, Jinhyo Ahn, Yeong-Hyeon Seo, Jae-Beom Kim, Soyoung Lee, Jin-Hui Yoon, Eunji Kong, Yong Jeong, Sangyong Jon, Pilhan Kim, Ki-Hun Jeong, ",Scientific reports,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30837501

Here, we describe the creation of very high surface-to-volume ratio passive devices (vertical nanowire probes) using large-scale fabrication process, allowing to follow the electrical activity of mammalian neurons. Based on conventional silicon processing, the silicon nanowires were silicided in platinum in order to improve their electrochemical performances and to guarantee their biocompatibility. Very high signal to noise ratio was achieved (up to 2000) when measuring spontaneous action potentials. Moreover, this bio-platform was used to record the impact of various bio-chemical and electrical stimulations on neuronal activity. To conclude, this study proposes a thorough comparison of the characteristics and performances of these new nanowire-based nanoprobes with the main alternative systems published up to now.","['1 LAAS-CNRS, Université de Toulouse, CNRS, Toulouse, France.']","A Casanova, L Bettamin, M-C Blatche, F Mathieu, H Martin, D Gonzalez-Dunia, L Nicu, G Larrieu, ",Journal of physics.

689,Punishment of alcohol-reinforced responding in alcohol preferring P rats reveals a bimodal population: Implications for models of compulsive drug seeking,"Individual variations in animal behaviour can be used to describe relationships between different constructs, as well as the underlying neurobiological mechanisms responsible for such variation. In humans, variation in the expression of certain traits contributes to the onset of psychopathologies, such as drug addiction. Addiction is characterised by persistent drug use despite negative consequences, but it occurs in only a sub-population of drug users. Compulsive drug use is modelled in laboratory animals by punishing a drug-reinforced operant response. It has been reported that there is individual variability in the response to punishment, and in this report we aim to further define the conditions under which this variation can be observed. We have previously used footshock punishment to suppress alcohol seeking in an animal model of context-induced relapse to alcohol seeking after punishment-imposed abstinence. Here we present a re-examination of the training and punishment data from a large cohort of rats (n=499) collected over several years. We found evidence for a bimodal distribution in the response to punishment in alcohol preferring P rats. We only observed this population split when rats received constant shock intensity for three sessions, but not when increasing shock intensity was used. This observation provides evidence for the existence of two distinct groups of rats, defined by their response to punishment, in an otherwise homogeneous population. The implications of this observation are discussed in reference to prior observations using punishment of other addictive drugs (cocaine and methamphetamine), the potential causes of this phenomenon, and with broader implications for the cause of alcohol and drug addiction in humans.","['1 Anatomy & Neurosciences Department, VUmc, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; The Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, Parkville, Victoria 3052, Australia; Florey Department of Neuroscience and Mental Health, The University of Melbourne, Victoria 3010, Australia.

691,"Two-photon optical imaging, spectral and fluorescence lifetime analysis to discriminate urothelial carcinoma grades","In the framework of urologic oncology, mini-invasive procedures have increased in the last few decades particularly for urothelial carcinoma. One of the essential elements in the management of this disease is still the diagnosis, which strongly influences the choice of treatment. The histopathologic evaluation of the tumor grade is a keystone of diagnosis, and tumor characterization is not possible with just a macroscopic evaluation. Even today intraoperative evaluation remains difficult despite the emergence of new technologies which use exogenous fluorophore. This study assessed an optical multimodal technique based on endogenous fluorescence, combining qualitative and quantitative analysis, for the diagnostic of urothelial carcinoma. It was found that the combination of two-photon fluorescence, second harmonic generation microscopy, spectral analysis and fluorescence lifetime imaging were all able to discriminate tumor from healthy tissue, and to determine the grade of tumors. Spectral analysis of fluorescence intensity and the redox ratio used as quantitative evaluations showed statistical differences between low-grade and high-grade tumors. These results showed that multimodal optical analysis is a promising technology for the development of an optical fiber setup designed for an intraoperative diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma in the area of endo-urology.","['1 Sorbonne Université, GRC n°20 LITHIASE RENALE, AP-HP, Hôpital Tenon, F-75020, Paris, France.', '2 IMNC Laboratory, UMR 8165-CNRS/IN2P3, Paris-Saclay University, Orsay, France.', '3 Department of Pathology, Hôpital Tenon, HUEP, AP-HP, Sorbonne University, Paris, France.', '4 Laboratoire Interfaces et Systèmes Electrochimiques, UMR 8235-CNRS, Sorbonne Université, F-75005 Paris, France.', '5 Laboratoire de Physique des Solides, CNRS UMR 8502, Université Paris Sud XI, Orsay, France; CNRS, Laboratoire de Chimie de la Matière Condensée de Paris, UPMC, Collège de France, Paris, France.', '6 Paris Diderot University, Sorbonne Paris Cité, F-75013, Paris, France.']","Benjamin Pradère, Fanny Poulon, Eva Compérat, Ivan T Lucas, Dominique Bazin, Steeve Doizi, Olivier Cussenot, Olivier Traxer, Darine Abi Haidar, ",Journal of biophotonics,2018 Nov,bladder tumor; endomicroscopy; fluorescence lifetime imaging; spectroscopy; two-photon imaging.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29806125
692,A novel training-free method for real-time prediction of femoral strain,"Surrogate methods for rapid calculation of femoral strain are limited by the scope of the training data. We compared a newly developed training-free method based on the superposition principle (Superposition Principle Method, SPM) and popular surrogate methods for calculating femoral strain during activity. Finite-element calculations of femoral strain, muscle, and joint forces for five different activity types were obtained previously. Multi-linear regression, multivariate adaptive regression splines, and Gaussian process were trained for 50, 100, 200, and 300 random samples generated using Latin Hypercube (LH) and Design of Experiment (DOE) sampling. The SPM method used weighted linear combinations of 173 activity-independent finite-element analyses accounting for each muscle and hip contact force. Across the surrogate methods, we found that 200 DOE samples consistently provided low error (RMSE < 100 µε), with model construction time ranging from 3.8 to 63.3 h and prediction time ranging from 6 to 1236 s per activity. The SPM method provided the lowest error (RMSE = 40 µε), the fastest model construction time (3.2 h) and the second fastest prediction time per activity (36 s) after Multi-linear Regression (6 s). The SPM method will enable large numerical studies of femoral strain and will narrow the gap between bone strain prediction and real-time clinical applications.","['1 Medical Device Research Institute, College of Science and Engineering, Flinders University, Clovelly Park, SA, Australia.

695,Quick visualization of neurons in brain tissues using an optical clearing technique,"Neurons are classified into several morphological types according to the locations of their somata and the branching patterns of their axons and dendrites. Recent studies suggest that these morphological features are related to their physiological properties, including firing characteristics, responses to neuromodulators, and wiring patterns. Therefore, rapid morphological identification of electrophysiologically recorded neurons promises to advance our understanding of neuronal circuits. One of the most common anatomical cell identification methods is neuronal reconstruction with biocytin delivered through whole-cell patch-clamp pipettes. However, conventional reconstruction methods usually take longer than 24 h and limit the throughput of electrophysiological experiments. Here, we developed a quick, simple cell reconstruction method by optimizing the tissue clearing protocol ScaleSQ. We found that adding 200 mM NaCl almost entirely prevented tissue swelling without compromising optical clearing ability. This solution, termed IsoScaleSQ, allowed us to increase the transparency of the gray matter of 500-µm-thick slices within 30 min, meaning that the total time required to reconstruct whole-cell recorded neurons was reduced to 1 h. This novel method will improve the efficacy and effectiveness of electrophysiological experiments linked to cell morphology.","['1 Laboratory of Chemical Pharmacology, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-0033, Japan.', '2 Laboratory of Chemical Pharmacology, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-0033, Japan. takeyuki.miyawaki@gmail.com.', '3 Department of Morphological Neuroscience, Graduate School of Medicine, Gifu University, 1-1 Yanagido, Gifu City, Gifu, 501-1194, Japan.', '4 Center for Highly Advanced Integration of Nano and Life Sciences, Gifu University, 1-1 Yanagido, Gifu City, Gifu, 501-1194, Japan.', '5 Center for Information and Neural Networks, National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Suita City, Osaka, 565-0871, Japan.']","Yu Sato, Takeyuki Miyawaki, Ayako Ouchi, Asako Noguchi, Shun Yamaguchi, Yuji Ikegaya, ",Anatomical science international,2019 Mar,Isotropic; Optical clearing; Patch-clamp recording; ScaleSQ; Visualization.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30600446

697,"Neurophysiological Comparison Among Tonic, High Frequency, and Burst Spinal Cord Stimulation: Novel Insights Into Spinal and Brain Mechanisms of Action","Rationale:
      
    

    
      Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is an effective option for neuropathic pain treatment. New technological developments, as high-frequency (HF) and theta burst stimulation (TBS), have shown promising results, although putative mechanisms of action still remain debated. Methods:
      
    

    
      thirty patients with lower back pain were enrolled and underwent LF, HF, and TBS. Laser evoked potentials (LEPs) were recorded by using a Nd:YAG laser. Amplitudes and latencies of the main two components (N1, N2/P2) were compared among different experimental sessions. Changes in resting motor threshold (RMT), cortical silent period (cSP), short intracortical inhibition (SICI), and intracortical facilitation (ICF) were also evaluated. Results:
      
    

    
      TBS dampened LEP amplitudes compared with LF (N1: p = 0.032; N2/P2: p < 0.0001) and HF stimulation (N1: p = 0.029; N2/P2: p < 0.0001, Holm-Sidak post-hoc test). Concurrently, TBS increased N1 latency, when compared with baseline and LF stimulation (p = 0.009 and 0.0033). Whereas RMT and SICI did not change among experimental conditions, TBS significantly prolonged cSP duration compared with baseline (p = 0.002), LF (p = 0.048), and HF-SCS (p = 0.016); finally, both HF (p = 0.004) and TBS (p = 0.0039) increased ICF. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      TBS modulates medial and lateral pain pathways through distinct mechanisms, possibly involving both GABA(a)ergic and Glutamatergic networks at an intracortical level. These results may have implications for therapy and for the choice of best stimulation protocol.","['1 Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Section of Neurophysiopathology, Pisa University Medical School, Pisa, Italy.', ""2 Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milano, Italy."", '3 Pain Therapy Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Pisana, Pisa, Italy.', '4 Division of Neurology, Ospedale Bambino Gesù, IRCCS, Rome, Italy.', '5 Center for Sensory-Motor Interaction, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark.', '6 Neuroscience Institute, National Research Council Pisa, Pisa, Italy.']","Tommaso Bocci, Giuliano De Carolis, Mery Paroli, Davide Barloscio, Laura Parenti, Lara Tollapi, Massimiliano Valeriani, Ferdinando Sartucci, ",Neuromodulation : journal of the International Neuromodulation Society,2018 Jul,Laser evoked potentials; neurophysiology; spinal cord stimulation; transcranial magnetic stimulation.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29314454

Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) quantifies and maps cell biochemistry, a complex ensemble of dynamic processes.

We also share the implementation of hardware and software as an open platform, show applications of fast FLIM biochemical imaging on living cells and discuss strategies to balance precision and accuracy in FLIM. The recent innovations and commercialisation of fast time-domain FLIM systems are likely to popularise FLIM within the biomedical community, to impact biomedical research positively and to foster the adoption of other FLIM techniques as well.

Here, penetrating arrays of flexible microelectrodes made of low-impedance nanomeshes are presented, which are capable of recording single-unit electrophysiological neuronal activity and at the same time, transparent, allowing to bridge electrical and optical brain mapping modalities. These 32 transparent penetrating electrodes with site area, 225 µm2 , have a low impedance of ≈149 kΩ at 1 kHz, an adequate charge injection limit of ≈0.76 mC cm-2 , and up to 100% yield. Mechanical bending tests reveal that the array is robust up to 1000 bending cycles, and its high transmittance of 67% at 550 nm makes it suitable for combining with various optical methods. A temporary stiffening using polyethylene glycol allows the penetrating nanomesh arrays to be inserted into the brain minimally invasively, with in vivo validation of recordings of spontaneous and evoked single-unit activity of neurons across layers of the mouse visual cortex.

The bionic artificial nerve features flexibility, rapid response (<21 ms), high robustness, excellent durability (>10,000 tests), personalized cutability, and no energy consumption when no mechanical stimulation is being applied. The response signals are highly regionally differentiated for the mechanical stimulations, which enables the bionic artificial nerve to mimic the spatiotemporally dynamic logic of a biological neural network. Multifunctional touch interactions demonstrate the enormous potential of the bionic artificial nerve for human-machine hybrid perceptual enhancement.

703,In Vivo Electrophysiological Measurement of Compound Muscle Action Potential from the Forelimbs in Mouse Models of Motor Neuron Degeneration,"Assessing the functionality of the nerve axon provides detailed information on the progression of neuromuscular disorders. Electrophysiological recordings provide a sensitive approach to measure nerve conduction in humans and rodent models. To broaden the technical possibilities for electromyography in mice, the measurement of compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) from the brachial plexus nerve in the forelimb using needle electrodes is described here. CMAP recordings after stimulating the sciatic nerve in hindlimbs have been previously described. The newly introduced method here allows for the evaluation of the nerve conductivity at an additional site, and thus provides a more profound overview of the neuromuscular functionality. The technique provides information on both the relative number of functional axons and the myelination level. Thereby, this method can be applied to assess both axonal diseases as well as demyelinating conditions. This minimally invasive method does not require extraction of the nerve and therefore it is suitable for repeated measurements for longitudinal follow-up in the same animal.

704,Single-trial cross-area neural population dynamics during long-term skill learning,"Mammalian cortex has both local and cross-area connections, suggesting vital roles for both local and cross-area neural population dynamics in cortically-dependent tasks, like movement learning. Prior studies of movement learning have focused on how single-area population dynamics change during short-term adaptation. It is unclear how cross-area dynamics contribute to movement learning, particularly long-term learning and skill acquisition. Using simultaneous recordings of rodent motor (M1) and premotor (M2) cortex and computational methods, we show how cross-area activity patterns evolve during reach-to-grasp learning in rats. The emergence of reach-related modulation in cross-area activity correlates with skill acquisition, and single-trial modulation in cross-area activity predicts reaction time and reach duration. Local M2 neural activity precedes local M1 activity, supporting top-down hierarchy between the regions. M2 inactivation preferentially affects cross-area dynamics and behavior, with minimal disruption of local M1 dynamics. Together, these results indicate that cross-area population dynamics are necessary for learned motor skills.","['1 Neuroscience Graduate Program, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', '2 Medical Scientist Training Program, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', '3 Neurology and Rehabilitation Service, San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center, San Francisco, CA, USA.', '4 Department of Neurology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', '5 Neurology and Rehabilitation Service, San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center, San Francisco, CA, USA. karunesh.ganguly@ucsf.edu.', '6 Department of Neurology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. karunesh.ganguly@ucsf.edu.']","T L Veuthey, K Derosier, S Kondapavulur, K Ganguly, ",Nature communications,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32792523
705,Quantitative metabolomics comparison of traditional blood draws and TAP capillary blood collection,"Introduction:
      
    

    
      Mass spectrometry and computational biology have advanced significantly in the past ten years, bringing the field of metabolomics a step closer to personalized medicine applications. Despite these analytical advancements, collection of blood samples for routine clinical analysis is still performed through traditional blood draws. Objective:
      
    

    
      TAP capillary blood collection has been recently introduced for the rapid, painless draw of small volumes of blood (~ 100 μL), though little is known about the comparability of metabolic phenotypes of blood drawn via traditional venipuncture and TAP devices. Methods:
      
    

    
      UHPLC-MS-targeted metabolomics analyses were performed on blood drawn traditionally or through TAP devices from 5 healthy volunteers. Absolute quantitation of 45 clinically-relevant metabolites was calculated against stable heavy isotope-labeled internal standards. Results:
      
    

    
      Ranges for 39 out of 45 quantified metabolites overlapped between drawing methods. Pyruvate and succinate were over threefold higher in the TAP samples than in traditional blood draws. No significant changes were observed for other carboxylates, glucose or lactate. TAP samples were characterized by increases in reduced glutathione and decreases in urate and cystine, markers of oxidation of purines and cysteine-overall suggesting decreased oxidation during draws. The absolute levels of bile acids and acyl-carnitines, as well as almost all amino acids, perfectly correlated among groups (Spearman r ≥ 0.95). Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Though further more extensive studies will be mandatory, this pilot suggests that TAP-derived blood may be a logistically-friendly source of blood for large scale metabolomics studies-especially those addressing amino acids, glycemia and lactatemia as well as bile acids, acyl-carnitine levels.","['1 Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, 80045, USA.', '2 Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver - Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, 80045, USA. angelo.dalessandro@ucdenver.edu.']","Alexis Catala, Rachel Culp-Hill, Travis Nemkov, Angelo D'Alessandro, ",Metabolomics : Official journal of the Metabolomic Society,2018,Blood draw; Mass spectrometry; Metabolomics; Personalized medicine.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30830393
706,Generating Microdroplet Array on Photonic Pseudo-paper for Absolute Quantification of Nucleic Acids,"Here, we propose a new platform for digital nucleic acid assay based on a microdroplet array. The hydrophilic-superhydrophobic property of the pseudopaper photonic nitrocellulose substrate is employed to divide an aqueous sample containing the target nucleic acid into hundreds of microdroplets for loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). The LAMP reaction leads to the production of fluorescent calcein. By counting the number of microdroplets that are fluorescent, the target nucleic acid (i.e., Staphylococcus aureus DNA) with the copy number ranging from 1 to 1000 can be absolutely quantified without using sophisticated microfluidic devices. The effect of fluorescence enhancement attributed to the photonic nitrocellulose can effectively amplify the detection signal and reduce the amplification time. Thus, we believe that the proposed platform for digital nucleic acid assay based on the microdroplet array is promising for rapid and cost-effective bioanalytical applications.","['1 State Key Laboratory of Bioelectronics, School of Biological Science and Medical Engineering , Southeast University , Nanjing 210096 , China.']","Junjie Chi, Changmin Shao, Xin Du, Hong Liu, Zhongze Gu, ",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2018,absolute quantification; digital LAMP; microdroplet array; photonic crystals; pseudopaper.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30335348
707,Oligosynaptic inhibition mediated by group Ia afferents from flexor digitorum superficialis to wrist flexors in humans,"Effects of low-threshold afferents from the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) to the flexor carpi radialis (FCR), flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) and extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) motoneurons were examined using a post-stimulus time-histogram (PSTH) and electromyogram-averaging (EMG-A) methods in seven healthy human subjects. Electrical conditioning stimulation to the median nerve branch innervating FDS with the intensity immediately below the motor threshold was delivered. In the PSTH study, the stimulation produced a trough (inhibition) in 19/44 (43%) of FCR and 17/41 (41%) of FCU motor units. Remaining motor units received no facilitatory and inhibitory effects. The central latency of the inhibition was 1.1 ± 0.6 ms (mean ± SD) and 0.6 ± 0.4 ms longer than that of the homonymous monosynaptic Ia facilitation of FCR and FCU, respectively. In the EMG-A study, the stimulation produced a trough (inhibition) in EMG-A of FCR and FCU in all the seven subjects. Amount of the inhibition was 14.5 ± 3.8% (FCR) and 17.9 ± 2.5% (FCU). Since the inhibition diminished after withdrawal of tonic vibration stimuli to the FDS muscle belly, group Ia afferents should be responsible for the inhibition. The stimulation did not produce facilitatory or inhibitory effect on ECU motoneurons in both the PSTH and EMG-A studies. These findings suggest that group Ia afferents from FDS inhibit excitability of motoneurons supplying FCR and FCU through an oligo (di- or tri-) synaptic path in the spinal cord. The reflex arcs would function to prevent wrist flexion during hand grasping movements.","['1 Department of Anatomy and Structural Science, Yamagata University School of Medicine, 2-2-2, Iida-nishi, Yamagata, 990-9585, Japan.', '2 Department of Physical Therapy, Yamagata Prefectural University of Health Sciences, Yamagata, Japan.', '3 Department of Occupational Therapy, Yamagata Prefectural University of Health Sciences, Yamagata, Japan.', '4 Department of Judo Therapy, Teikyo University Faculty of Medical Technology, Utsunomiya, Japan.', '5 Graduate School of Health Science, The Graduate School of Matsumoto University, Matsumoto, Japan.', '6 Department of Anatomy and Structural Science, Yamagata University School of Medicine, 2-2-2, Iida-nishi, Yamagata, 990-9585, Japan. anaitoh@med.id.yamagata-u.ac.jp.']","Mitsuhiro Nito, Wataru Hashizume, Manabu Jimenji, Katsuhiko Suzuki, Toshiaki Sato, Hiromi Fujii, Takuji Miyasaka, Masaomi Shindo, Akira Naito, ",Experimental brain research,2018 Jul,Extensor carpi ulnaris; Flexor carpi radialis; Flexor carpi ulnaris; Flexor digitorum superficialis; Human spinal cord; Oligosynaptic inhibition.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29679107
708,Neurons differentiate magnitude and location of mechanical stimuli,"Neuronal activity can be modulated by mechanical stimuli. To study this phenomenon quantitatively, we mechanically stimulated rat cortical neurons by shear stress and local indentation. Neurons show 2 distinct responses, classified as transient and sustained. Transient responses display fast kinetics, similar to spontaneous neuronal activity, whereas sustained responses last several minutes before returning to baseline. Local soma stimulations with micrometer-sized beads evoke transient responses at low forces of ∼220 nN and pressures of ∼5.6 kPa and sustained responses at higher forces of ∼360 nN and pressures of ∼9.2 kPa. Among the neuronal compartments, axons are highly susceptible to mechanical stimulation and predominantly show sustained responses, whereas the less susceptible dendrites predominantly respond transiently. Chemical perturbation experiments suggest that mechanically evoked responses require the influx of extracellular calcium through ion channels. We propose that subtraumatic forces/pressures applied to neurons evoke neuronal responses via nonspecific gating of ion channels.","['1 Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering, Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zurich, 4058 Basel, Switzerland; benjamin.gaub@bsse.ethz.ch daniel.mueller@bsse.ethz.ch.', '2 Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering, Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zurich, 4058 Basel, Switzerland.', '3 Neural Circuit Laboratories, Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research, 4058 Basel, Switzerland.']","Benjamin M Gaub, Krishna Chaitanya Kasuba, Emilie Mace, Tobias Strittmatter, Pawel R Laskowski, Sydney A Geissler, Andreas Hierlemann, Martin Fussenegger, Botond Roska, Daniel J Müller, ",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2020,atomic force microscopy; calcium response; cortex neurons; mechanobiology; mechanosensitivity.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31882453

Nowadays, computer-aided design of protein-ligand binding is an important tool to accomplish this task. Current approaches typically rely on high-throughput docking essays or computationally expensive atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Here, we present an approach to use the recently re-parametrized coarse-grained Martini model to perform unbiased millisecond sampling of protein-ligand interactions of small drug-like molecules. Remarkably, we achieve high accuracy without the need of any a priori knowledge of binding pockets or pathways. Our approach is applied to a range of systems from the well-characterized T4 lysozyme over members of the GPCR family and nuclear receptors to a variety of enzymes. The presented results open the way to high-throughput screening of ligand libraries or protein mutations using the coarse-grained Martini model.","['1 Groningen Biomolecular Sciences and Biotechnology Institute and Zernike Institute for Advanced Materials, University of Groningen, Nijenborgh 7, 9747 AG, Groningen, Netherlands. paulocts@gmail.com.', '2 Groningen Biomolecular Sciences and Biotechnology Institute and Zernike Institute for Advanced Materials, University of Groningen, Nijenborgh 7, 9747 AG, Groningen, Netherlands.', '3 Faculty of Biomedical Sciences, Institute of Computational Science, Università della Svizzera italiana (USI), via G.

ElectroMap implements automated signal segmentation, ensemble averaging and integrates optogenetic approaches. Here we employ ElectroMap for analysis, mapping and detection of pro-arrhythmic phenomena in silico, in cellulo, animal model and in vivo patient datasets. We anticipate that ElectroMap will accelerate innovative cardiac research and enhance the uptake, application and interpretation of mapping technologies leading to novel approaches for arrhythmia prevention.","['1 Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', '2 EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Physical Sciences for Health, School of Chemistry, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', '3 School of Computer Science, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', '4 Institute of Clinical Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', '5 Department of Physiology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia.', '6 Institute of Microbiology and Infection, School of Biosciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', '7 Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Department of Anatomy and Physiology, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', '8 Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Heart Center, Department of Cardiology, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', '9 Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.', '10 NIHR Leicester Biomedical Research Centre, Glenfield Hospital, Leicester, UK.', '11 Department of Cardiology, UHB NHS Trust, Birmingham, UK.', '12 School of Computer Science, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK. k.m.rajpoot@bham.ac.uk.', '13 Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK. d.pavlovic@bham.ac.uk.']","Christopher O'Shea, Andrew P Holmes, Ting Y Yu, James Winter, Simon P Wells, Joao Correia, Bastiaan J Boukens, Joris R De Groot, Gavin S Chu, Xin Li, G Andre Ng, Paulus Kirchhof, Larissa Fabritz, Kashif Rajpoot, Davor Pavlovic, ",Scientific reports,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30718782

      Subjects completed a maximal graded exercise test on an arm-ergometer and 3 6-min bouts of overground bionic ambulation using different modes of assistance, i.e. Maximal, Adaptive, Fixed. Cardiorespiratory (oxygen consumption) and metabolic (caloric expenditure and substrate utilization) measures were taken using a mobile metabolic cart at each overground bionic ambulation assistance. Results:
      
    

    
      Cardiorespiratory responses ranged from low (24% VO2peak) for the least impaired and fittest individual to supramaximal (124% VO2peak) for the participant with the largest impairments and the lowest level of fitness. Different overground bionic ambulation assistive modes elicited small (3-8% VO2peak) differences in cardiorespiratory responses for 3 participants. One participant had a large (28% VO2peak) difference in cardiorespiratory responses to different modes of overground bionic ambulation. Metabolic responses mostly tracked closely with cardiorespiratory responses. Total energy expenditure ranged from 1.39 to 7.17 kcal/min.

Among proteinaceous targets, metabotropic and ionotropic receptors garnered much of the attention over the last 30 years, and it is only relatively recently that voltage-gated ion channels have clearly and rigorously been shown to be important molecular targets.

717,"Biomechanics of Blast TBI With Time-Resolved Consecutive Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Loads","Blast-induced traumatic brain injury (bTBI) has become a signature casualty of recent military operations. In spite of significant clinical and preclinical TBI research, current understanding of injury mechanisms and short- and long-term outcomes is limited. Mathematical models of bTBI biomechanics may help in better understanding of injury mechanisms and in the development of improved neuroprotective strategies. Until present, bTBI has been analyzed as a single event of a blast pressure wave propagating through the brain. In many bTBI events, the loads on the body and the head are spatially and temporarily distributed, involving the primary intracranial pressure wave, followed by the head rotation and then by head impact on the ground. In such cases, the brain microstructures may experience time/space distributed (consecutive) damage and recovery events. The paper presents a novel multiscale simulation framework that couples the body/brain scale biomechanics with micro-scale mechanobiology to study the effects of micro-damage to neuro-axonal structures. Our results show that the micro-mechanical responses of neuro-axonal structures occur sequentially in time with ""damage"" and ""relaxation"" periods in different parts of the brain. A new integrated computational framework is described coupling the brain-scale biomechanics with micro-mechanical damage to axonal and synaptic structures.","['1 CFD Research Corp., 701 McMillan Way NW, Huntsville, AL.', '2 US Naval Research Laboratory, 4555 Overlook Ave., Washington, DC.', '3 Pennsylvania State University, 320 Leonhard Building, University Park, PA.', '4 DoD Blast Program Coordinating Office, US Army MRMC, 504 Scott Street, Fort Detrick, MD.']","Andrzej Przekwas, Harsha T Garimella, X Gary Tan, Z J Chen, Yuyang Miao, Vincent Harrand, Reuben H Kraft, Raj K Gupta, ",Military medicine,2019,Blast injury; injury biomechanics; mathematical model; multiscale modeling; traumatic brain injury.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30901406

In spite of the huge number of articles investigating different unit cells for porous biomaterials, no studies are reported in the literature that optimize the geometric parameters of such unit cells based on mechanobiological criteria. Parametric finite element models of scaffolds with rhombicuboctahedron unit cell were developed and incorporated into an optimization algorithm that combines them with a computational mechanobiological model. The algorithm perturbs iteratively the geometry of the unit cell until the best scaffold geometry is identified, i.e. the geometry that allows to maximize the formation of bone. Performances of scaffolds with rhombicuboctahedron unit cell were compared with those of other scaffolds with hexahedron unit cells. We found that scaffolds with rhombicuboctahedron unit cell are particularly suited for supporting medium-low loads, while, for higher loads, scaffolds with hexahedron unit cells are preferable. The proposed algorithm can guide the orthopaedic/surgeon in the choice of the best scaffold to be implanted in a patient-specific anatomic region.","['1 Dipartimento di Meccanica, Matematica e Management, Politecnico di Bari, Bari 70126, Italy.

Spectra measurements as a function of magnetic field strength were performed using an optical spectrometer. The response of both a PSD and PMMA fiber were investigated to isolate the changes in response from the scintillator and the noise signal as a function of magnetic field strength. All irradiations were performed in water at a photon beam energy of 6 MV. Magnetic field strengths of (0, ±0.35, ±0.70, ±1.05, and ±1.40) T were investigated. Four noise subtraction techniques were investigated to evaluate the impact on the resulting noise-subtracted scintillator response with magnetic field strength. The noise subtraction methods included direct spectral subtraction, the spectral method, and variants thereof. The PMMA fiber exhibited changes in response of up to 50% with magnetic field strength due to the directional light emission from [Formula: see text]erenkov radiation. The PSD showed increases in response of up to 10% when not corrected for the noise signal, which agrees with previous investigations of scintillator response in magnetic fields. Decreases in the [Formula: see text]erenkov light ratio with negative field strength were observed with a maximum change at -1.40 T of 3.2% compared to 0 T. The change in the noise-subtracted PSD response as a function of magnetic field strength varied with the noise subtraction technique used. Even after noise subtraction, the PSD exhibited changes in response of up to 5.5% over the four noise subtraction methods investigated.","['1 Department of Medical Physics, School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI 53705, United States of America.

720,Basic biomechanics of spinal cord injury - How injuries happen in people and how animal models have informed our understanding,"The wide variability, or heterogeneity, in human spinal cord injury is due partially to biomechanical factors. This review summarizes our current knowledge surrounding the patterns of human spinal column injury and the biomechanical factors affecting injury. The biomechanics of human spinal injury is studied most frequently with human cadaveric models and the features of the two most common injury patterns, burst fracture and fracture dislocation, are outlined. The biology of spinal cord injury is typically studied with animal models and the effects of the most relevant biomechanical factors - injury mechanism, injury velocity, and residual compression, are described. Tissue damage patterns and behavioural outcomes following dislocation or distraction injury mechanisms differ from the more commonly used contusion mechanism. The velocity of injury affects spinal cord damage, principally in the white matter. Ongoing, or residual compression after the initial impact does affect spinal cord damage, but few models exist that replicate the clinical scenario. Future research should focus on the effects of these biomechanical factors in different preclinical animal models as recent data suggests that treatment outcomes may vary between models.","['1 International Collaboration on Repair Discoveries (ICORD), University of British Columbia, 818 West 10th Avenue, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of British Columbia, 6250 Applied Science Lane, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.', '2 International Collaboration on Repair Discoveries (ICORD), University of British Columbia, 818 West 10th Avenue, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada.', '3 International Collaboration on Repair Discoveries (ICORD), University of British Columbia, 818 West 10th Avenue, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; Department of Orthopaedics, University of British Columbia, 910 West 10th Avenue, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada.', '4 International Collaboration on Repair Discoveries (ICORD), University of British Columbia, 818 West 10th Avenue, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; Departments of Zoology and Surgery, University of British Columbia, 6270 University Boulevard, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.', '5 International Collaboration on Repair Discoveries (ICORD), University of British Columbia, 818 West 10th Avenue, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of British Columbia, 6250 Applied Science Lane, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; Department of Orthopaedics, University of British Columbia, 910 West 10th Avenue, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada.

721,Quantum Nonlocal Aberration Cancellation,"Phase distortions, or aberrations, can negatively influence the performance of an optical imaging system. Through the use of position-momentum entangled photons, we nonlocally correct for aberrations in one photon's optical path by intentionally introducing the complementary aberrations in the optical path of the other photon. In particular, we demonstrate the simultaneous nonlocal cancellation of aberrations that are of both even and odd order in the photons' transverse degrees of freedom. We also demonstrate a potential application of this technique by nonlocally canceling the effect of defocus in a quantum imaging experiment and thereby recover the original spatial resolution.","['1 Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York 14627, USA.', '2 Department of Physics, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario K1N 6N5, Canada.', '3 The College of Optics and Photonics, University of Central Florida, Orlando, Florida 32816, USA.', '4 School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, United Kingdom.']","A Nicholas Black, Enno Giese, Boris Braverman, Nicholas Zollo, Stephen M Barnett, Robert W Boyd, ",Physical review letters,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31702197
722,The application of ion mobility mass spectrometry to metabolomics,"Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics is being increasingly utilized in various research fields including investigating human diseases, nutrition, industrial applications, and plant/natural products studies. Although new analytical approaches have enhanced the performance of metabolomic analyses, significant challenges associated with throughput, metabolome coverage, and compound identification still exist. Ion mobility mass spectrometry offers great potential for improving throughput and depth of coverage in metabolomics experiments. For example, multi-dimensional, structural resolution offered by ion mobility enables improved identification of metabolites and chemical classes. This mini-review discusses the advantages, recent developments and limitations of using ion mobility mass spectrometry as part of a metabolomics workflow.","['1 Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Colorado Denver, Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, United States.', '2 Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Colorado Denver, Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, United States.

723,Sensory Specializations of Mormyrid Fish Are Associated with Species Differences in Electric Signal Localization Behavior,"The ability to localize communication signals plays a fundamental role in social interactions. For signal localization to take place, the sensory system of the receiver must extract information about distance and direction to the sender from physical characteristics of the signal. In many sensory systems, information from multiple peripheral receptors must be integrated by central sensory pathways to determine the sender location. Here, we asked whether evolutionary divergence in the electrosensory and visual systems of mormyrid fish is associated with signal localization behavior. In mormyrids, differences in the distribution of electroreceptors on the surface of the skin are associated with differences in the midbrain exterolateral nucleus (EL). Species with electroreceptors clustered in three rosettes on both sides of the head have a small and undifferentiated EL. In contrast, EL is enlarged and subdivided into anterior (ELa) and posterior (ELp) regions in species that have electroreceptors broadly -distributed throughout the body. Interestingly, species with EL and clustered electroreceptors also have larger visual systems and higher visual acuity than species with ELa/ELp and broadly distributed electroreceptors. Species with broadly distributed electroreceptors and ELa/ELp approached a simulated conspecific by following the curved electric field lines generated by the electrosensory stimulus. In contrast, a species with small EL and clustered electroreceptors, but an enlarged visual system, followed shorter and straighter paths to the stimulus source. In the central electrosensory system, evoked field potentials in response to stimuli delivered from the left versus the right differed more in EL than in ELa/ELp. Our results suggest that signal localization behavior is associated with differences in sensory specializations. We propose that the distribution of electroreceptors on the body affects the ability of individuals to align parallel to electric field lines and maintain such alignment while approaching the signal source. The spatial resolution of sensory information relayed from the periphery to the midbrain in species with clustered electroreceptors may allow for gross, but not fine, processing of sender location. Furthermore, visual information may play an important role in localizing signaling individuals in species with small EL and clustered electroreceptors. In line with previous studies, we suggest that the physiological and behavioral differences associated with signal localization reflect adaptations to different habitats and social environments.","['1 Department of Biology, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri, USA.', '2 Department of Biology, San Francisco State University, San Francisco, California, USA.', '3 Department of Biology, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri, USA, carlson.bruce@wustl.edu.']","Alejandro Vélez, Da Yeon Ryoo, Bruce A Carlson, ","Brain, behavior and evolution",2018,Electric organ discharge; Evoked field potential; Mormyridae; Passive electrolocation; Sensory physiology; Signal localization; Weakly electric fish.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30820010

725,Hybrid proton-photon inverse optimization with uniformity-regularized proton and photon target dose,"The goal of radiation therapy is to deliver tumoricidal dose to clinical target volume (CTV) while sparing organs-at-risk (OAR). We hypothesize that the joint use of proton and photon radiation therapy via appropriate hybrid proton-photon inverse planning method will be more favorable than proton or photon therapy alone, in terms of optimized combination of CTV coverage and OAR sparing. This work develops hybrid proton-photon inverse optimization method that simultaneously optimizes proton and photon variables. To account for delivery uncertainty, proton dose is targeted at CTV using robust optimization, and photon dose is targeted at either CTV using robust optimization or planning target volume (PTV) using the same setup shifts. The optimization objectives enforce OAR sparing and uniform CTV coverage for the total dose, while imposing uniform-dose regularization at targets for both the proton and photon component in order for both components to be individually deliverable. The hybrid problem with dose-volume-histogram (DVH) constraints is nonconvex and solved by iterative convex relaxations of DVH constraints and alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Preliminary results suggest the hybrid proton-photon planning potentially improves proton or photon planning in terms of optimized combination of CTV coverage and OAR sparing.","['1 Department of Radiation Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322, United States of America.']","Hao Gao, ",Physics in medicine and biology,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30978714
726,Spatio-energetic cross-talk in photon counting detectors: N × N binning and sub-pixel masking,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      Smaller pixel sizes of x-ray photon counting detectors (PCDs) benefit count rate capabilities but increase cross-talk and ""double-counting"" between neighboring PCD pixels. When an x-ray photon produces multiple (n) counts at neighboring (sub-)pixels and they are added during post-acquisition N × N binning process, the variance of the final PCD output-pixel will be larger than its mean. In the meantime, anti-scatter grids are placed at the pixel boundaries in most of x-ray CT systems and will decrease cross-talk between sub-pixels because the grids mask sub-pixels underneath them, block the primary x-rays, and increase the separation distance between active sub-pixels. The aim of this paper was, first, to study the PCD statistics with various N × N binning schemes and three different masking methods in the presence of cross-talks, and second, to assess one of the most fundamental performances of x-ray CT: soft tissue contrast visibility. Methods:
      
    

    
      We used a PCD cross-talk model (Photon counting toolkit, PcTK) and produced cross-talk data between 3 × 3 neighboring sub-pixels and calculated the mean, variance, and covariance of output-pixels with each of N × N binning scheme [4 × 4 binning, 2 × 2 binning, and 1 × 1 binning (i.e., no binning)] and three different sub-pixel masking methods (no mask, 1-D mask, and 2-D mask). We then set up simulation to evaluate the soft tissue contrast visibility. X-rays of 120 kVp were attenuated by 10-40 cm-thick water, with the right side of PCDs having 0.5 cm thicker water than the left side. A pair of output-pixels across the left-right boundary were used to assess the sensitivity index (SI or d'), which typically ranges 0-1 and is a generalized signal-to-noise ratio and a statistics used in signal detection theory. Results:
      
    

    
      Binning a larger number of sub-pixels resulted in larger mean counts and larger variance-to-mean ratio when the lower threshold of the energy window was lower than the half of the incident energy. Mean counts are in the order of no mask (the largest), 1-D mask, and 2-D mask but the difference in variance-to-mean ratio was small. For a given sub-pixel size and masking method, binning more sub-pixels degraded the normalized SI values but the difference between 4 × 4 binning and 1 × 1 binning was typically less than 0.06. 1-D mask provided better normalized SI values than no mask and 2-D mask for side-by-side case and the improvements were larger with fewer binnings, although the difference was less than 0.10. 2-D mask was the best for embedded case. The normalized SI values of combined binning, sub-pixel size, and masking were in the order of 1 × 1 (900 μm)2 binning, 2 × 2 (450 μm)2 binning, and 4 × 4 (225 μm)2 binning for a given masking method but the difference between each of them were typically 0.02-0.05. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      We have evaluated the effect of double-counting between PCD sub-pixels with various binning and masking methods. SI values were better with fewer number of binning and larger sub-pixels. The difference among various binning and masking methods, however, was typically less than 0.06, which might result in a dose penalty of 13% if the CT system were linear.","['1 Radiological Physics Division, The Russell H.

727,Conjugated Polymers for Assessing and Controlling Biological Functions,"The field of organic bioelectronics is advancing rapidly in the development of materials and devices to precisely monitor and control biological signals. Electronics and biology can interact on multiple levels: organs, complex tissues, cells, cell membranes, proteins, and even small molecules. Compared to traditional electronic materials such as metals and inorganic semiconductors, conjugated polymers (CPs) have several key advantages for biological interactions: tunable physiochemical properties, adjustable form factors, and mixed conductivity (ionic and electronic). Herein, the use of CPs in five biologically oriented research topics, electrophysiology, tissue engineering, drug release, biosensing, and molecular bioelectronics, is discussed. In electrophysiology, implantable devices with CP coating or CP-only electrodes are showing improvements in signal performance and tissue interfaces. CP-based scaffolds supply highly favorable static or even dynamic interfaces for tissue engineering. CPs also enable delivery of drugs through a variety of mechanisms and form factors. For biosensing, CPs offer new possibilities to incorporate biological sensing elements in a conducting matrix. Molecular bioelectronics is today used to incorporate (opto)electronic functions in living tissue. Under each topic, the limits of the utility of CPs are discussed and, overall, the major challenges toward implementation of CPs and their devices to real-world applications are highlighted.","['1 School of Materials Science and Engineering, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, 2052, Australia.', '2 Department of Micro and Nanosystems, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, 10044, Stockholm, Sweden.', '3 Electrical Engineering Division, Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, 9 JJ Thomson Ave., Cambridge, CB3 0FA, UK.', '4 Swedish Medical Nanoscience Center, Department of Neuroscience, Karolinska Institute, 17177, Stockholm, Sweden.']","Erica Zeglio, Alexandra L Rutz, Thomas E Winkler, George G Malliaras, Anna Herland, ","Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",2019 May,biosensors; conjugated polymers; electrophysiology; organic bioelectronics; tissue engineering.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30861237
728,Foot centre of pressure and ground reaction force during quadriceps resistance exercises; a comparison between force plates and a pressure insole system,"The study compared the centre of pressure measurements (COP) and vertical ground reaction forces (vGRF) from a pressure insole system to that from force plates (FP) during two flywheel quadriceps resistance exercises: leg press and squat. The comparison was performed using a motion capture system and simultaneous measurements of COP and vGRF from FP and insoles. At lower insole-vGRF (<250 N/insole) COP accuracy deteriorated and those data were excluded from further analysis. The insoles systematically displaced the COP slightly posteriorly and medially compared to the FP measurements. Pearson's coefficient of correlation (r) between insole- and FP-COP showed good agreement in both the anteroposterior (squat: r = 0.96, leg press: r = 0.97) and mediolateral direction (squat: r = 0.84, leg press: r = 0.90), whereas the root-mean-square errors (RMSE) were lower in the mediolateral (squat: 3.9 mm, leg press: 4.5 mm) than the anteroposterior (squat and leg press: 11.8 mm) direction. Vertical GRF was slightly overestimated by the insoles in leg press and RMSE were greater in leg press (8% of peak force) than in squat (6%). Overall, results were within the range of previous studies performed on gait. The strong agreement between insole and FP measurements indicates that insoles may replace FPs in field applications and biomechanical computations during resistance exercise, provided that the applied force is sufficient.","['1 Department of Environmental Physiology, Swedish Aerospace Physiology Centre, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Solna, Sweden.

      Tin-base catalyst is one of the widely used organometallic catalysts in polyurethane technology. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of tin organometallic catalyst in the radiation response and radiological properties of a new formula of PRESAGE®. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      In the study, two types of PRESAGE were fabricated. A very little amount of dibutyltindillaurate (DBTDL) (0.07% weight) was used as a catalyst in the fabrication of new PRESAGE (i.e., PRESAGE with catalyst), which components were: 93.93% weight polyurethane, 5% weight tetrachloride, and 1% weight leucomalachite green (LMG). For PRESAGE without catalyst, 94% weight polyurethane, 4% weight tetrachloride, and 2% weight LMG were used. Radiochromic response and postirradiation stability of PRESAGEs were determined. Also, radiological characteristics of PRESAGEs, such as mass density, electron density, mass attenuation coefficient, and mass stopping power in different photon energies were assessed and compared with water. Results:
      
    

    
      The absorption peak of new PRESAGE compared to PRESAGE without catalyst was observed without change. Sensitivity of new PRESAGE was higher than PRESAGE without catalyst and its stability after the first 1 h was relatively constant. Also, Mass attenuation coefficient of new PRESAGE in energy ranges <0.1 MeV was 10% more than water, whereas the maximum difference of mass stopping power was only 3%. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Tin organometallic catalyst in very low concentration can be used in fabrication of radiochromic polymer gel to achieve high sensitivity and stability as well as good radiological properties in the megavoltage photon beam.","['1 Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', '2 Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences; Radiotherapy Oncology Department, Cancer Research Centre, Cancer Institute; Tehran, Iran.', '3 Laser and Optics Research School, NSTRI, Tehran, Iran.', '4 Department of Engineering, Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran.', '5 Department of Optics and Photonics, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran.']","Davood Khezerloo, Hassan Ali Nedaie, Abbas Takavar, Alireza Zirak, Bagher Farhood, Nooshin Banaee, Eisa Alidokht, ",Journal of cancer research and therapeutics,Jan-Mar 2018,Dosimetry; PRESAGE®; radiation; three-dimensional dosimetry.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29516911
732,COMBSecretomics: A pragmatic methodological framework for higher-order drug combination analysis using secretomics,"Multi drug treatments are increasingly used in the clinic to combat complex and co-occurring diseases. However, most drug combination discovery efforts today are mainly focused on anticancer therapy and rarely examine the potential of using more than two drugs simultaneously. Moreover, there is currently no reported methodology for performing second- and higher-order drug combination analysis of secretomic patterns, meaning protein concentration profiles released by the cells. Here, we introduce COMBSecretomics (https://github.com/EffieChantzi/COMBSecretomics.git), the first pragmatic methodological framework designed to search exhaustively for second- and higher-order mixtures of candidate treatments that can modify, or even reverse malfunctioning secretomic patterns of human cells. This framework comes with two novel model-free combination analysis methods; a tailor-made generalization of the highest single agent principle and a data mining approach based on top-down hierarchical clustering. Quality control procedures to eliminate outliers and non-parametric statistics to quantify uncertainty in the results obtained are also included. COMBSecretomics is based on a standardized reproducible format and could be employed with any experimental platform that provides the required protein release data. Its practical use and functionality are demonstrated by means of a proof-of-principle pharmacological study related to cartilage degradation. COMBSecretomics is the first methodological framework reported to enable secretome-related second- and higher-order drug combination analysis.

      To develop an adult guinea pig model of lipotoxicity and explore the underlying mechanisms associated with changes in the expression of the delayed rectifier potassium current (IK). Background:
      
    

    
      Lipotoxicity may represent a common link among metabolic disorders and a higher vulnerability to arrhythmias. Methods:
      
    

    
      Whole-cell patch clamp, and palmitic acid (PA, a potent inducer of lipotoxicity), were used to assess mechanisms of short-term (∼50 days) high-fat diet (HFD) feeding on atrial electrophysiology in guinea pig hearts and myocytes. Results:
      
    

    
      HFD fed guinea pigs were significantly heavier, displayed hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia; but no signs of hyperglycemia or inflammation compared to low-fat diet fed controls. Increasing cardiac PA levels, resulted in shortened atrial action potential duration, and increased IK density. Inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) prevented increases in IK due to PA. Acute (≥1hr) exposure of atrial myocytes to exogenous PA (1 mM) increased the density of the rapid delayed rectifier potassium current IKr, while it was decreased with the unsaturated oleic acid (OA, 1 mM). Serine-threonine protein phosphatase-2 (PP2A) inhibition with cantharidin reversed the effect of OA on IKr. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Our data provide evidence of a novel lipotoxic guinea pig model with signs of vulnerability to arrhythmias.

      To correlate the dose response and changes in microscopic structures of the radiochromic films exposed to the clinical magnetic field in the range 1.5-3 T with standard and flattening filter-free (FFF) photon beams. Methods:
      
    

    
      The radiochromic film was cut into 5 × 5 cm2 sheets/samples from one batch. These samples were exposed to a 1.5-T and/or 3-T B-fields from an MRI scanner using an abdominal sequence for 7 min before and after irradiation with 6 MV and/or 6 MV FFF beams. Films were placed in a reference condition at 5 cm depth in a solid water phantom and exposed up to 20 Gy. The sample orientation was maintained the same during exposure, readout, and scanning electron microscopic (SEM) analysis. The samples were scanned with an Epson Expression 11000XL in a 48-bit RGB color mode at 300 dpi with red channel. Scanned images were processed in Image J and red channel mean intensity values were recorded. The samples were then coated with 6 nm gold and imaged by SEM Teneo (5 kV, 13 pA) under 2000, 2500, and 3000 magnifications for texture analysis. Results:
      
    

    
      The changes in the microstructure of the films in magnetic fields (1.5- and 3.0-T) were dose dependent. The orientation and granular size of samples at higher doses were altered compared to the controls. Needle-shaped structures of the active layer were longer and aligned for samples exposed to higher doses and magnetic field. However, no significant changes in optical density due to the presence of a magnetic field pre/postirradiation up to 20 Gy were observed. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Fine structures of the film represent the polymerization characteristics that are affected by the radiation dose in the magnetic field. Upon exposure to radiation, diacetylene monomers undergo polymerization that forms longer chains with a temporal response. Even though this study did not notice any significant changes in optical density due to the presence of magnetic field, this should be studied in simultaneous application of the magnetic field during treatment in a dedicated MR-linac unit.","['1 Department of Radiation Oncology, NYU Langone Medical Center & Laura and Isaac Perlmutter Cancer Center, New York, NY, 10016, USA.', '2 Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, George Washington University, Washington, DC, 20052, USA.', '3 Bernard and Irene Schwartz Center for Biomedical Imaging, Department of Radiology, NYU Langone Medical Center, New York, NY, 10016, USA.']","Olga Volotskova, Xuiqi Fang, Michael Keidar, Hersh Chandarana, Indra J Das, ",Medical physics,2019 Jan,MRI; dosimetry; magnetic field; microstructure; radiochromic film.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30341911
735,Compact single-shot metalens depth sensors inspired by eyes of jumping spiders,"Jumping spiders (Salticidae) rely on accurate depth perception for predation and navigation. They accomplish depth perception, despite their tiny brains, by using specialized optics. Each principal eye includes a multitiered retina that simultaneously receives multiple images with different amounts of defocus, and from these images, distance is decoded with relatively little computation. We introduce a compact depth sensor that is inspired by the jumping spider. It combines metalens optics, which modifies the phase of incident light at a subwavelength scale, with efficient computations to measure depth from image defocus. Instead of using a multitiered retina to transduce multiple simultaneous images, the sensor uses a metalens to split the light that passes through an aperture and concurrently form 2 differently defocused images at distinct regions of a single planar photosensor. We demonstrate a system that deploys a 3-mm-diameter metalens to measure depth over a 10-cm distance range, using fewer than 700 floating point operations per output pixel. Compared with previous passive depth sensors, our metalens depth sensor is compact, single-shot, and requires a small amount of computation. This integration of nanophotonics and efficient computation brings artificial depth sensing closer to being feasible on millimeter-scale, microwatts platforms such as microrobots and microsensor networks.","['1 John A.

      In nanoparticle-aided radiotherapy, the computational paradigm has been that inside the cell, nanoparticles are distributed sparsely and solitarily. However, experiments reveal significant cluster formation, which affects radiosensitization and must be considered in clinical treatment planning. We characterize the impact of gold nanoparticle agglomeration on the predicted radiation dose enhancement as function of size, geometry, morphology and incident beam energy.

      Next-generation coupled electron-photon deterministic computations were performed using subnanometric unstructured spatial mesh. Results:
      
    

    
      Unlike single nanoparticles, agglomerates develop two types of dose enhancement, smooth peripheral distributions and isolated hotspots, which depend on the cluster size and geometry in opposite ways. Conclusion:

      To examine patterns of care associated with the administration of proton versus photon therapy for adult patients with primary brain tumors in a large national cohort from the United States. Methods:
      
    

    
      The National Cancer Database (NCDB) was queried for newly diagnosed primary brain tumors (2004-2014) in adult patients aged 18 and older receiving proton or photon radiotherapy. Clinical features, patient demographics and treatment parameters were extracted. Differences between groups were assessed using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results:
      
    

    
      In total, 73,073 patients were analyzed (n = 72,635 [99.4%] photon therapy, n = 438 [0.6%] proton therapy). On multivariable analysis of photon versus proton therapy, several factors predicted for receipt of proton therapy, including younger age (p = .041), highest income quartile (p = .007), treatment at academic institutions (p < .001), in regional facilities outside the Midwest/South (p < .001), diagnosis in more recent years (p = .003), fewer comorbidities (p < .001) and non-glioblastoma histology (p < .001).

741,Metacognitive scaffolding boosts cognitive and neural benefits following executive attention training in children,"Interventions including social scaffolding and metacognitive strategies have been used in educational settings to promote cognition. In addition, increasing evidence shows that computerized process-based training enhances cognitive skills. However, no prior studies have examined the effect of combining these two training strategies. The goal of this study was to test the combined effect of metacognitive scaffolding and computer-based training of executive attention in a sample of typically developing preschoolers at the cognitive and brain levels. Compared to children in the regular training protocol and an untrained active control group, children in the metacognitive group showed larger gains on intelligence and significant increases on an electrophysiological index associated with conflict processing. Moreover, changes in the conflict-related brain activity predicted gains in intelligence in the metacognitive scaffolding group. These results suggest that metacognitive scaffolding boosts the influence of process-based training on cognitive efficiency and brain plasticity related to executive attention.","['1 Department of Experimental Psychology and Center for Research on Mind, Brain and Behavior (CIMCYC), Universidad de Granada, Granada, Spain.', '2 Basque Center on Cognition, Brain and Language, BCBL, San Sebastian, Spain.']","Joan Paul Pozuelos, Lina M Combita, Alicia Abundis, Pedro M Paz-Alonso, Ángela Conejero, Sonia Guerra, M Rosario Rueda, ",Developmental science,2019 Mar,ERPs; development; executive attention; intelligence; metacognition; scaffolding; training.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30257077
742,Avoiding Internal Capsule Stimulation With a New Eight-Channel Steering Deep Brain Stimulation Lead,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Novel deep brain stimulation (DBS) lead designs are currently entering the market, which are hypothesized to provide a way to steer the stimulation field away from neural populations responsible for side effects and towards populations responsible for beneficial effects. The objective of this study is to assess the performances of a new eight channel steering-DBS lead and compare this with a conventional cylindrical contact (CC) lead. Approach:
      
    

    
      The two leads were evaluated in a finite element electric field model combined with multicompartment neuron and axon models, representing the internal capsule (IC) fibers and subthalamic nucleus (STN) cells. We defined the optimal stimulation setting as the configuration that activated the highest percentage of STN cells, without activating any IC fibers. With this criterion, we compared monopolar stimulation using a single contact of the steering-DBS lead and CC lead, on three locations and four orientations of the lead. In addition, we performed a current steering test case by dividing the current over two contacts with the steering-DBS lead in its worst-case orientation. Main results:
      
    

    
      In most cases, the steering-DBS lead is able to stimulate a significantly higher percentage of STN cells compared to the CC lead using single contact stimulation or using a two contact current steering protocol when there is approximately a 1 mm displacement of the CC lead. The results also show that correct placement and orientation of the lead in the target remains an important aspect in achieving the optimal stimulation outcome. Significance:
      
    

    
      Currently, clinical trials are set up in Europe with a similar design as the steering-DBS lead. Our results illustrate the importance of the orientation of the new steering-DBS lead in avoiding side effects induced by stimulation of IC fibers. Therefore, in clinical trials sufficient attention should be paid to implanting the steering DBS-lead in the most effective orientation.","['1 MIRA Institute for Biomedical Engineering and Technical Medicine, University of Twente, Enschede, NL, The Netherlands.', '2 Department of Neurology/Clinical Neurophysiology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, NL, The Netherlands.']","Kees J van Dijk, Rens Verhagen, Lo J Bour, Ciska Heida, Peter H Veltink, ",Neuromodulation : journal of the International Neuromodulation Society,2018 Aug,Computational modeling; Parkinson's disease; deep brain stimulation; novel lead design; steering-DBS.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29034586
743,Dronpa: A Light-Switchable Fluorescent Protein for Opto-Biomechanics,"Since the development of the green fluorescent protein, fluorescent proteins (FP) are indispensable tools in molecular biology. Some FPs change their structure under illumination, which affects their interaction with other biomolecules or proteins. In particular, FPs that are able to form switchable dimers became an important tool in the field of optogenetics. They are widely used for the investigation of signaling pathways, the control of surface recruitment, as well as enzyme and gene regulation. However, optogenetics did not yet develop tools for the investigation of biomechanical processes. This could be leveraged if one could find a light-switchable FP dimer that is able to withstand sufficiently high forces. In this work, we measure the rupture force of the switchable interface in pdDronpa1.2 dimers using atomic force microscopy-based single molecule force spectroscopy. The most probable dimer rupture force amounts to around 80 pN at a pulling speed of 1600 nm/s. After switching of the dimer using illumination at 488 nm, there are hardly any measurable interface interactions, which indicates the successful dissociation of the dimers. Hence this Dronpa dimer could expand the current toolbox in optogenetics with new opto-biomechanical applications like the control of tension in adhesion processes.","['1 Lehrstuhl für Angewandte Physik and Center for Nanoscience , Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität , Munich 80799 , Germany.']","Res Jöhr, Magnus S Bauer, Leonard C Schendel, Carleen Kluger, Hermann E Gaub, ",Nano letters,2019,Dronpa; Optogenetics; atomic force microscopy; biomechanics; single molecule force spectroscopy.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30912662

However, until now, most presented studies on soft robots were limited to only partly soft designs, since all solutions at least needed conventional, stiff electronics to sense, process signals and activate actuators. We present a novel approach for a set up and the experimental validation of an artificial pace maker that is able to drive basic robotic structures and act as artificial central pattern generator. The structure is based on multi-functional dielectric elastomers (DEs). DE actuators, DE switches and DE resistors are combined to create complex DE oscillators (DEOs). Supplied with only one external DC voltage, the DEO autonomously generates oscillating signals that can be used to clock a robotic structure, control the cyclic motion of artificial muscles in bionic robots or make a whole robotic structure move. We present the basic functionality, derive a mathematical model for predicting the generated signal waveform and verify the model experimentally.","['1 Institute of Solid State Electronics, TU Dresden, 01062 Dresden, Germany.

746,Effects of combining high- and low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on upper limb hemiparesis in the early phase of stroke,"Background:
      
    

    
      Both high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF-rTMS) and low-frequency rTMS (LF-rTMS) are reported to benefit upper limb motor function rehabilitation in patients with stroke. However, the efficacy of combining LF- and HF-rTMS (LF-HF rTMS) has not been adequately explored, especially in the early phase of stroke. Objective:
      
    

    
      To compare the effects of LF- and LF-HF rTMS on the upper limb motor function in the early phase post stroke. Methods:
      
    

    
      Sixty-two patients were randomly assigned to three groups: LF-rTMS group (1 Hz rTMS to the contralesional hemisphere), LF-HF rTMS group (1 Hz rTMS to the contralesional hemisphere followed by 10 Hz rTMS to the lesional hemisphere) and sham group. The patients received the same conventional rehabilitation accompanied with sessions of rTMS for 15 consecutive days. The upper limb motor function was evaluated using the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) and the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) before the first session, after the last session, and at 3 months after the last session. Results:
      
    

    
      All patients finished the study without any adverse reaction. Three groups exhibited improvement in terms of the FMA score and the log WMFT time at the end of the treatment and 3 months later. Better improvement was found in the LF-HF rTMS group than in the LF-rTMS and sham groups. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The results indicated that both LF- and LF-HF rTMS were effective in promoting upper limb motor recovery in patients with acute stroke. Combining HF- and LF-rTMS protocol in the present study is tolerable and more beneficial for motor improvement than the unilateral use of LF-rTMS alone.","['1 Department of Orthopaedics, Tangdu Hospital, the Fourth Military Medical University, China.', '2 Department of Rehabilitation, Xijing Hospital, the Fourth Military Medical University, China.']","Hua Long, Hongbin Wang, Chenguang Zhao, Qiang Duan, Feng Feng, Nan Hui, Li Mao, Huiling Liu, Xiang Mou, Hua Yuan, ",Restorative neurology and neuroscience,2018,Stroke; early phase; motor function; rehabilitation; repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation; upper limb.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29439359
747,Tuning of Structural Colors Like a Chameleon Enabled by Shape-Memory Polymers,"Nature often uses structuring of materials for coloration rather than incorporating dye molecules, since single-construction materials are capable of producing any vivid visible color in plants and insects. By precisely engineering features that diffract or scatter light, more recently, humans have created similarly intense non-fading colors. Stretchable polymer opals have emerged as a single material which can dynamically shift across the whole visible spectrum using structural colors, by temporary stretching or compression. For energy efficiency and practical considerations, however, it is necessary to fix semi-permanently desired colors without continuous stretching or application of other stimuli or energy. Here, a polymer opal incorporating a shape-memory polymer embedded in its matrix can keep a particular color fixed without the application of external forces, yet can be reprogrammed to a different fixed color on demand. The influence of the material composition on its optical appearance, shape-fixity, and shape recovery abilities in controlled stretch experiments is quantified. High-speed printing-compatible localized compression pattern imprinting is shown to generate stable but easily erasable color patterns. This opens up the potential for durable and energy-efficient yet reusable and reconfigurable displays, wearables, or packaging and security labeling based on such polymeric film materials.","['1 Institute of Microstructure Technology, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Hermann-von-Helmholtz-Platz 1, 76344, Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen, Germany.', '2 Nanophotonics Centre, Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB3 0HE, UK.', '3 School of Engineering and Materials Science, Queen Mary University of London, London, E1 4NS, UK.', '4 Department of Material Science and Metallurgy, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB3 0FS, UK.', '5 Department of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Engineering, Faculty of Chemistry and Pharmacy, Sofia University, 1 James Bourchier Ave., 1164, Sofia, Bulgaria.']","Senta Schauer, Jeremy J Baumberg, Hendrik Hölscher, Stoyan K Smoukov, ",Macromolecular rapid communications,2018 Nov,photonic crystals; polymer opals; shape-memory polymers; tunable structural colors.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30207618

749,Fecobionics: A Novel Bionics Device for Studying Defecation,"During defecation, solid, semisolid or liquid stools are eliminated via the anus in a complex physiological process. Up to 25% of the population are affected by anorectal disorders that are poorly recognized and treated. We developed a new bionics device, a simulated stool named Fecobionics, to replace several current tests of anorectal function. Fecobionics was developed to simulate the defecation process that depends on rectal forces, the anorectal size angle, and anorectal size and sensitivity. Fecobionics provided axial pressure signatures, measurement of bending (anorectal angle) and geometric mapping in a single examination. It had the consistency and shape of normal stool. The device had a soft core with embedded electronics and a bag for distension. The paper describes the device development and validation. Furthermore, data were obtained in preliminary experiments in pigs, healthy human subjects and patients with focus on four important features of the system, i.e. measurements of pressure signatures, bending characteristics, impedance measurements and data transmission. Accurate pressure and orientation data as well as geometric profiles were successfully obtained on the bench as well as in vivo in pigs and human subjects during defecation. Fecobionics is a novel technology imitating defecation. The clinical future ultimately depends on its ability to impact on daily treatment of anorectal disorders. A potential long-term clinical application is use of the device for biofeedback training for dyssynergic defecation.","['1 College of Communication Engineering, Chongqing University, Shapingba, Chongqing, 400044, China.', '2 College of Communication Engineering, Chongqing University, Shapingba, Chongqing, 400044, China. zyhuang@cqu.edu.cn.', '3 GIOME, Department of Surgery Prince of Wales Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, NT, Hong Kong.', '4 GIOME DB, Discovery Bay, Hong Kong, Hong Kong.', '5 GIOME Academia, Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.', '6 GIOME, Department of Surgery Prince of Wales Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, NT, Hong Kong. hag@giome.org.', '7 California Medical Innovations Institute, San Diego, CA, 92122, USA. hag@giome.org.']","Daming Sun, Zhiyong Huang, Zhuoli Zhuang, Zhiyao Ma, Lo Kar Man, Donghua Liao, Hans Gregersen, ",Annals of biomedical engineering,2019 Feb,Anal sphincter relaxation; Anorectal physiology; Bionics; Defecation; Fecobionics.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30341740

      To compare flash visual evoked potentials (FVEP) elicited using a Ganzfeld bowl (G), Mini Ganzfeld (MG) and Flash Goggles (GG) with eyes open and closed. Patients and method:
      
    

    
      The study group comprised 17 volunteers with mean age of 30 years; all of them were examined with the Roland Consult electrophysiological diagnostic system. Active electrodes were placed at O1 and O2. With the G and MG stimulators, the flash generated by white-light-emitting diodes (LEDs) presented standard flash of 3 cd s m-2. The GG used red LED flash of 3 cd s m-2. Stimulus frequency of 1.0 Hz, low-pass filter of 1.0 Hz and high-pass filters of 100 Hz (G); 50 Hz (MG); 30 Hz (GG) were used. P2 amplitude and latency were compared by the means of the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test. Results:
      
    

    
      After right eye stimulation (from O1; n = 17), the mean amplitudes of P2, elicited with the G, MG and GG, were 13, 7 and 10 µV, respectively. The respective latencies were 129, 114 and 110 ms. Hence, the difference between the results obtained with these stimulators was statistically significant (p < 0.05). The mean P2 amplitudes, acquired by the means of the G, MG and GG, were 13 µV, 7 µV and 10 µV for open eyes, and 11 µV, 8 µV and 8 µV for closed eyes. The respective latencies were 129, 114 and 110 ms for eyes open, and 127, 125 and 121 ms for eyes closed. These results of the MG (latency only) and GG (latency and amplitude) stimulation differed significantly (p < 0.05). Conclusion:

This technique is used to produce pulsed quantum frequency combs.

752,Application of 1 H-NMR-based metabolomics to the analysis of cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) supplements,"Introduction:
      
    

    
      Commercial cranberry supplements provide a low-sugar alternative to juices and sweetened fruit consumed for health benefits, but their phytochemical composition and associated biological activity varies depending on the source material and post-harvest processing. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1 H-NMR) is a rapid and environmentally friendly method of generating metabolic profiles of plant materials that may be used to authenticate cranberry products. Objective:
      
    

    
      The 1 H NMR-based chemometrics were used to characterise variations in metabolic profiles of cranberry supplements in comparison to a whole cranberry powder reference standard. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      The secondary metabolite profiles of nine commercial cranberry supplements were compared to a whole cranberry powder reference standard, using 1 H-NMR with Bruker AssureNMR software and principal component analysis (PCA). Content of selected triterpenoids and organic acids was determined by quantitative NMR. Total proanthocyanidins and anthocyanins were determined by established methods. Results:
      
    

    
      PCA of 1 H-NMR spectra showed overlap between the cranberry standard and three supplements, but most products varied substantially in metabolic profile. Metabolites contributing to the observed variance include citric acid and cranberry peel constituents ursolic acid, oleanolic acid and hyperoside. Ursolic, oleanolic, citric, quinic and malic acids were readily determined by quantitative 1 H-NMR in the whole cranberry standard, but were below detection limits in many supplements. Proanthocyanidin and flavonoid content in several products was minimal or below detection limits. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The 1 H-NMR chemometrics found significant variation in composition of characteristic cranberry metabolites among commercial preparations, reinforcing the need for reliable industry standards.","['1 Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, North Dartmouth, MA, USA.', '2 Bruker BioSpin Inc., Billerica, MA, USA.']","John R Turbitt, Kimberly L Colson, K Brian Killday, Andrew Milstead, Catherine C Neto, ",Phytochemical analysis : PCA,2020 Jan,Vaccinium macrocarpon; dietary supplement; metabolomics; natural health product; nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31389645

In this editorial, we describe the role that Omics can play in aquaculture, and provide a synopsis for each of the Special Issue articles that use these technologies to improve aquaculture practices. Current genomic resources available for some aquaculture species are also described. The number of datasets is impressive for species such as Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout, totaling in the thousands (NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus and Sequence Read Archive). We present a conceptual framework that describes how Omics can be leveraged to understand complex responses of aquatic animals in culture for relevant physiological outcomes, such as fecundity, growth, and immunity. Lastly, knowledge gaps and new directions are identified to address current obstacles in aquaculture. Articles in this Special Issue on aquaculture in CBPD highlight the diversity and scope of Omics in aquaculture. As the technology becomes more cost-effective, it is anticipated that genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and lipidomics will play increasingly important roles in stock diagnostics (e.g. genetics, health, performance).

754,Photonic crystal enhanced fluorescence immunoassay on diatom biosilica,"Fluorescence biosensing is one of the most established biosensing methods, particularly fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy. These are two highly sensitive techniques but require high-grade electronics and optics to achieve the desired sensitivity. Efforts have been made to implement these methods using consumer grade electronics and simple optical setups for applications such as point-of-care diagnostics, but the sensitivity inherently suffers. Sensing substrates, capable of enhancing fluorescence are thus needed to achieve high sensitivity for such applications. In this paper, we demonstrate a photonic crystal-enhanced fluorescence immunoassay biosensor using diatom biosilica, which consists of silica frustules with sub-100 nm periodic pores. Utilizing the enhanced local optical field, the Purcell effect and increased surface area from the diatom photonic crystals, we create ultrasensitive immunoassay biosensors that can significantly enhance fluorescence spectroscopy as well as fluorescence imaging. Using standard antibody-antigen-labeled antibody immunoassay protocol, we experimentally achieved 100× and 10× better detection limit with fluorescence spectroscopy and fluorescence imaging respectively.

756,Bionic Thermoelectric Response with Nanochannels,"Thermosensation, the ability to detect environmental temperature change, is one of most ancient and crucial processes for the survival of all living organisms. Mammals use temperature-sensitive transient receptor potential (thermoTRP) cation channels as thermometers to convert the temperature change into electrical signals that are finally received as action potentials by nerve endings. In this work, we report the bionic thermosensation by solid-state hybrid nanochannels based on the principle of thermally sensitive permselective ion transport. The hybrid nanochannels possess an asymmetric structure, consisting of ultrasmall silica nanochannels (∼2.3 nm in diameter, ∼100 nm in length) supported by large-sized track-etched poly(ethylene terephthalate) conical nanochannels. When the hybrid nanochannels are engineered to separate two electrolyte solutions, the temperature change in one solution can be directly converted into trans-nanochannel diffusion potential, akin to the natural thermosensation process. Two bionic modes, namely, in the absence and presence of a concentration gradient, were studied to imitate the natural thermosensation of thermoTRP ion channels and shark, respectively. In both cases, real-time thermoelectric response was captured with a fast relative response speed (electrical response time versus temperature change time) of higher than 98%, as well as excellent stability and reversibility. Moreover, the nanochannels are highly sensitive to thermal stimulus, showing a sensitivity of 0.71 mV/K comparable to the natural thermosensation. The experimental results coincide well with the theoretical relationship between electrical response and temperature change derived in terms of a quasi-steady-state ion transport model. Finite element simulations based on coupled Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) and Einstein-Stokes equations were also performed, confirming that the sensitive thermoelectric response originates from the highly cationic selectivity of nanochannels.","['1 Institute of Analytical Chemistry, Department of Chemistry , Zhejiang University , Hangzhou 310058 , China.']","Kexin Chen, Lina Yao, Bin Su, ",Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31067855

758,"Chemically defined, ultrasoft PDMS elastomers with selectable elasticity for mechanobiology","Living animal cells are strongly influenced by the mechanical properties of their environment. To model physiological conditions ultrasoft cell culture substrates, in some instances with elasticity (Young's modulus) of only 1 kPa, are mandatory. Due to their long shelf life PDMS-based elastomers are a popular choice. However, uncertainty about additives in commercial formulations and difficulties to reach very soft materials limit their use. Here, we produced silicone elastomers from few, chemically defined and commercially available substances. Elastomers exhibited elasticities in the range from 1 kPa to 55 kPa. In detail, a high molecular weight (155 kg/mol), vinyl-terminated linear silicone was crosslinked with a multifunctional (f = 51) crosslinker (a copolymer of dimethyl siloxane and hydrosilane) by a platinum catalyst. The following different strategies towards ultrasoft materials were explored: sparse crosslinking, swelling with inert silicone polymers, and, finally, deliberate introduction of dangling ends into the network (inhibition). Rheological experiments with very low frequencies led to precise viscoelastic characterizations. All strategies enabled tuning of stiffness with the lowest stiffness of ~1 kPa reached by inhibition. This system was also most practical to use. Biocompatibility of materials was tested using primary cortical neurons from rats. Even after several days of cultivation no adverse effects were found.","['1 Institute of Complex Systems 7, Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH, Jülich, Germany.', '2 Juelich Centre for Neutron Science 1 and Institute of Complex Systems 1, Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH, Jülich, Germany.']","Viktor Heinrichs, Sabine Dieluweit, Jörg Stellbrink, Wim Pyckhout-Hintzen, Nils Hersch, Dieter Richter, Rudolf Merkel, ",PloS one,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29624610
759,Do changes in spinal reflex excitability elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation differ based on the site of cerebellar stimulation?,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      The present study aimed to investigate whether spinal reflex excitability is influenced by the site of cerebellar transcranial magnetic stimulation (C-TMS). Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      Fourteen healthy volunteers (mean age: 24.6 ± 6.6 years [11 men]) participated. Participants lay on a bed in the prone position, with both ankle joints fixed to prevent unwanted movement. Right tibial nerve stimulation was provided to elicit the H-reflex in the right soleus muscle. Conditioning transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was delivered at one of the following sites 110 ms prior to tibial stimulation: right, central, or left cerebellum; midline parietal (Pz) region; or sham stimulation. A total of 10 test trials were included for each condition, in random order. The unconditioned and conditioned H-reflexes were measured during random inter-test trials, and the cerebellar spinal facilitation (CSpF) ratios for each site were calculated (the ratio of conditioned to unconditioned H-reflexes). CSpF ratios were compared among TMS sites. Results:
      
    

    
      CSpF ratios were significantly higher at cerebellar sites than at the Pz site or during sham stimulation. However, there was no significant difference in CSpF ratio among cerebellar sites. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      TMS conditioning over any part of the cerebellum facilitated the excitability of the spinal motoneuron pool. Facilitation of the H-reflex due to C-TMS may involve the effects of the bilateral descending tract of the spinal cord on the spinal motoneuron pool. Alternatively, direct brainstem stimulation may have activated portions of the bilateral descending tract of the spinal cord.","['1 a Faculty of Rehabilitation , Shijonawate Gakuen University , Daitou City , Osaka , Japan.']","Akiyoshi Matsugi, ",Somatosensory & motor research,2018 Jun,Cerebellum; H-reflex; transcranial magnetic stimulation.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29732943

Here, we present the systemDrive, a novel multisite, multiregion microdrive that is capable of moving microwire electrode bundles into targets along independent and nonparallel drive trajectories. Our design decouples the stereotaxic surgical placement of individual guide cannulas for each trajectory from the placement of a flexible drive structure. This separation enables placement of many microwire multitrodes along widely spaced and independent drive axes with user-set electrode trajectories and depths from a single microdrive body, and achieves stereotaxic precision with each. The system leverages tight tube-cannula tolerances and geometric constraints on flexible drive axes to ensure concentric alignment of electrode bundles within guide cannulas. Additionally, the headmount and microdrive both have an open-center design to allow for the placement of additional sensing modalities. This design is the first, in the context of small rodent chronic research, to provide the capability to finely position microwires through multiple widely distributed cell groups, each with stereotaxic precision, along arbitrary and nonparallel trajectories that are not restricted to emanate from a single source. We demonstrate the use of the systemDrive in male Long-Evans rats to observe simultaneous single-unit and multiunit activity from multiple widely separated sleep-wake regulatory brainstem cell groups, along with cortical and hippocampal activity, during free behavior over multiple many-day continuous recording periods.","['1 Department of Engineering Science and Mechanics, Penn State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802.', '2 Center for Neural Engineering, Penn State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802.', '3 Department of Neural and Behavioral Sciences, Penn State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802.', '4 Department of Neurosurgery, Penn State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802.']","Myles W Billard, Fatemeh Bahari, John Kimbugwe, Kevin D Alloway, Bruce J Gluckman, ",eNeuro,2019,chronic; electrophysiology; freely behaving; microdrive; systems neuroscience; tetrode.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30627656

772,Comparative analysis of proteomic and metabolomic profiles of different species of Paris,"An extract prepared from species of Paris is the most widely consumed herbal product in China. The genus Paris includes a variety of genotypes with different medicinal component contents but only two are defined as official sources. Closely related species have different medicinal properties because of differential expression of proteins and metabolites. To better understand the molecular basis of these differences, we examined proteomic and metabolomic changes in rhizomes of P. polyphylla var. chinensis, P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis, and P. fargesii var. fargesii using a technique known as sequential window acquisition of all theoretical mass spectra as well as gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. In total, 419 proteins showed significant abundance changes, and 33 metabolites could be used to discriminate Paris species. A complex analysis of proteomic and metabolomic data revealed a higher efficiency of sucrose utilization and an elevated protein abundance in the sugar metabolic pathway of P. polyphylla var. chinensis. The pyruvate content and efficiency of acetyl-CoA-utilization in saponin biosynthesis were also higher in P. polyphylla var. chinensis than in the other two species. The results expand our understanding of the proteome and metabolome of Paris and offer new insights into the species-specific traits of these herbaceous plants. SIGNIFICANCE: The traditional Chinese medicine Paris is the most widely consumed herbal product for the treatment of joint pain, rheumatoid arthritis and antineoplastic. All Paris species have roughly the same morphological characteristics; however, different members have different medicinal compound contents. Efficient exploitation of genetic diversity is a key factor in the development of rare medicinal plants with improved agronomic traits and malleability to challenging environmental conditions. Nevertheless, only a partial understanding of physiological and molecular mechanisms of different plants of Paris can be achieved without proteomics. To better understand the molecular basis of these differences and facilitate the use of other Paris species, we examine proteomic metabolomic changes in rhizomes of Paris using the technique known as SWATH-MS and GC/TOF-MS. Our research has provided information that can be used in other studies to compare metabolic traits in different Paris species. Our findings can also serve as a theoretical basis for the selection and cultivation of other Paris species with a higher medicinal value.","['1 National Center of Biomedical Analysis, Beijing 100850, China.', '2 College of Life Sciences, South-Central University for Nationalities, Wuhan 430074, China; Hubei Provincial Key Laboratory for Protection and Application of Special Plant Germplasm in Wuling Area of China, Wuhan 430074, China; National Demonstration Center for Experimental Ethnopharmacology Education (South-Central University for Nationalities), Wuhan 430074, China.

At the molecular level, finite-size effects, pronounced nonlinearities, and ballistic processes produce behavior that diverges from the macroscale. Here, we show that transient thermal transport reflects macromolecular energy landscape architecture through the topological characteristics of molecular contacts and the nonlinear processes that mediate dynamics. While the former determines transport pathways via pairwise interactions, the latter reflects frustration within the landscape for local conformational rearrangements. Unlike transport through small-molecule systems, such as alkanes, nonlinearity dominates over coherent processes at even quite short time- and length-scales. Our exhaustive all-atom simulations and novel local-in-time and space analysis, applicable to both theory and experiment, permit dissection of energy migration in biomolecules.

774,Automated Robust Proton Planning Using Dose-Volume Histogram-Based Mimicking of the Photon Reference Dose and Reducing Organ at Risk Dose Optimization,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      Patient selection for proton therapy is increasingly based on proton to photon plan comparisons. To improve efficient decision making, we developed a dose mimicking and reducing (DMR) algorithm to automatically generate a robust proton plan from a reference photon dose, as well as target and organ at risk (OAR) delineations. Methods and materials:
      
    

    
      The DMR algorithm was evaluated in 40 patients with head and neck cancer. The first step of the DMR algorithm comprises dose-volume histogram-based mimicking of the photon dose distribution in the clinical target volumes and OARs. Target robustness is included by mimicking the nominal photon dose in 21 perturbed scenarios. The second step of the optimization aims to reduce the OAR doses while retaining the robust target coverage as achieved in the first step. We evaluated each DMR plan against the manually robustly optimized reference proton plan in terms of plan robustness (voxel-wise minimum dose). Furthermore, the DMR plans were evaluated against the reference photon plan using normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) models of xerostomia, dysphagia, and tube feeding dependence. Consequently, ΔNTCPs were defined as the difference between the NTCPs of the photon and proton plans. Results:
      
    

    
      The dose distributions of the DMR and reference proton plans were very similar in terms of target robustness and OAR dose values. Regardless of proton planning technique (ie, DMR or reference proton plan), the same treatment modality was selected in 80% (32 of 40) of cases based on the ∑ΔNTCPs. In 15% (6 of 40) of cases, a conflicting decision was made based on relatively small dose differences to the OARs (<2.0 Gy). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The DMR algorithm automatically optimized robust proton plans from a photon reference dose that were comparable to the dosimetrist-optimized proton plans in patients with head and neck cancer. This algorithm has been successfully embedded into a framework to automatically select patients for proton therapy based on NTCPs.","['1 University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Department of Radiation Oncology, Groningen, the Netherlands.

775,Region-specific differences and areal interactions underlying transitions in epileptiform activity,"Key points:
      
    

    
      Local neocortical and hippocampal territories show different and sterotypical patterns of acutely evolving, epileptiform activity. Neocortical and entorhinal networks show tonic-clonic-like events, but the main hippocampal territories do not, unless it is relayed from the other areas. Transitions in the pattern of locally recorded epileptiform activity can be indicative of a shift in the source of pathological activity, and may spread through both synaptic and non-synaptic means. Hippocampal epileptiform activity is promoted by 4-aminopyridine and inhibited by GABAB receptor agonists, and appears far more sensitive to these drugs than neocortical activity. These signature features of local epileptiform activity can provide useful insight into the primary source of ictal activity, aiding both experimental and clinical investigation. Abstract:
      
    

    
      Understanding the nature of epileptic state transitions remains a major goal for epilepsy research. Simple in vitro models offer unique experimental opportunities that we exploit to show that such transitions can arise from shifts in the ictal source of the activity. These transitions reflect the fact that cortical territories differ both in the type of epileptiform activity they can sustain and in their susceptibility to drug manipulation. In the zero-Mg2+ model, the earliest epileptiform activity is restricted to neocortical and entorhinal networks. Hippocampal bursting only starts much later, and triggers a marked transition in neo-/entorhinal cortical activity. Thereafter, the hippocampal activity acts as a pacemaker, entraining the other territories to their discharge pattern. This entrainment persists following transection of the major axonal pathways between hippocampus and cortex, indicating that it can be mediated through a non-synaptic route. Neuronal discharges are associated with large rises in extracellular [K+ ], but we show that these are very localized, and therefore are not the means of entraining distant cortical areas. We conclude instead that the entrainment occurs through weak field effects distant from the pacemaker, but which are highly effective at recruiting other brain territories that are already hyperexcitable. The hippocampal epileptiform activity appears unusually susceptible to drugs that impact on K+ conductances. These findings demonstrate that the local circuitry gives rise to stereotypical epileptic activity patterns, but these are also influenced by both synaptic and non-synaptic long-range effects. Our results have important implications for our understanding of epileptic propagation and anti-epileptic drug action.","['1 Institute of Neuroscience, Medical School, Framlington Place, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE2 4HH, UK.', '2 Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA.']","Neela K Codadu, R Ryley Parrish, Andrew J Trevelyan, ",The Journal of physiology,2019 Apr,epilepsy; hippocampus; interictal discharges; neocortex; seizures.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30681139

The vast portion of the energy consumption of a ship is the need to overcome the drag between ship hull and water-depending on the shape of the vessel and its size up to 90% of total fuel consumption. This means reducing drag helps to save fuel and reduces carbon emissions as well as pollution considerably. Different techniques for drag reduction are known, e.g. the micro-bubble technique or the bulbous bow. We investigated a novel bioinspired technique since 2002: the application of biomimetic surfaces with long-term stable air layers on ship hulls, serving as a slip agent. This technology is based on the Salvinia Effect, allowing a permanent stabilization of air layers under water. In this case study, we analysed the possible savings, which also could be combined with modified micro-bubble technologies. We calculated, based on a selection of five ship types, representing 75% of the world fleet, that air-layer hull coatings could lead to estimated savings of 32.5 million tons of fuel (meaning 13.0% of the worldwide shipping fuel consumption), equal to 18.5 billion US$ and 130.0 million tons of CO2e per year. The positive impacts on global temperature and other greenhouse gases are calculated and could be a contributing factor in accomplishing the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The study is a contribution to enhance our patchy knowledge concerning the potential economic and ecological benefit of bionics and biomimetic technologies.

777,Spanish Implantable Cardioverter-defibrillator Registry. 15th Official Report of the Spanish Society of Cardiology Electrophysiology and Arrhythmias Section (2018),"Introduction and objectives:
      
    

    
      This article presents the data corresponding to automated implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implants in Spain reported to the Spanish Registry in 2018. Methods:
      
    

    
      The data in this registry include both primary implants and generator replacements and were gathered from a data collection sheet voluntarily completed by implantation centers. Results:
      
    

    
      In 2018, 6421 implant sheets were received compared with 7077 reported by Eucomed (European Confederation of Medical Suppliers Associations). This represents data on 90.7% of the devices implanted in Spain. Compliance ranged between 99.6% for the field ""name of the implanting hospital"" and 12.4% for ""population of residence"". A total of 173 hospitals reported their data to the registry, representing a slight decrease compared with hospitals participating in 2017 (n=181). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      After the reduction in ICD implants in 2017, the number of implants increased in 2018, with the highest number of ICDs implanted in Spain. The total number of implants remains much lower than the European Union average, with substantial differences between autonomous communities.","['1 Servicio de Cardiología, Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro Majadahonda, Majadahonda, Madrid, Spain.

778,A photon source model based on particle transport in a parameterized accelerator structure for Monte Carlo dose calculations,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      An accurate source model of a medical linear accelerator is essential for Monte Carlo (MC) dose calculations. This study aims to propose an analytical photon source model based on particle transport in parameterized accelerator structures, focusing on a more realistic determination of linac photon spectra compared to existing approaches. Methods:
      
    

    
      We designed the primary and secondary photon sources based on the photons attenuated and scattered by a parameterized flattening filter. The primary photons were derived by attenuating bremsstrahlung photons based on the path length in the filter. Conversely, the secondary photons were derived from the decrement of the primary photons in the attenuation process. This design facilitates these sources to share the free parameters of the filter shape and be related to each other through the photon interaction in the filter. We introduced two other parameters of the primary photon source to describe the particle fluence in penumbral regions. All the parameters are optimized based on calculated dose curves in water using the pencil-beam-based algorithm. To verify the modeling accuracy, we compared the proposed model with the phase space data (PSD) of the Varian TrueBeam 6 and 15 MV accelerators in terms of the beam characteristics and the dose distributions. The EGS5 Monte Carlo code was used to calculate the dose distributions associated with the optimized model and reference PSD in a homogeneous water phantom and a heterogeneous lung phantom. We calculated the percentage of points passing 1D and 2D gamma analysis with 1%/1 mm criteria for the dose curves and lateral dose distributions, respectively. Results:
      
    

    
      The optimized model accurately reproduced the spectral curves of the reference PSD both on- and off-axis. The depth dose and lateral dose profiles of the optimized model also showed good agreement with those of the reference PSD. The passing rates of the 1D gamma analysis with 1%/1 mm criteria between the model and PSD were 100% for 4 × 4, 10 × 10, and 20 × 20 cm2 fields at multiple depths. For the 2D dose distributions calculated in the heterogeneous lung phantom, the 2D gamma pass rate was 100% for 6 and 15 MV beams. The model optimization time was less than 4 min. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The proposed source model optimization process accurately produces photon fluence spectra from a linac using valid physical properties, without detailed knowledge of the geometry of the linac head, and with minimal optimization time.","['1 Department of Radiological Technology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, 980-8575, Japan.', '2 Department of Radiation Oncology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, 980-8574, Japan.', '3 Radiation Technology, Tohoku University Hospital, Sendai, 980-8574, Japan.']","Yoshiki Ishizawa, Suguru Dobashi, Noriyuki Kadoya, Kengo Ito, Takahito Chiba, Yoshiki Takayama, Kiyokazu Sato, Ken Takeda, ",Medical physics,2018 Jul,Monte Carlo; analytical model; dose calculation; linac; photon source model.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29772081

Atomic-Force microscopy of the area of maximum stresses in the corneal periphery showed no significant changes in the structure of the cornea when irradiated in the selected mode. Measurement of Young's modulus of the corneal surface areas after their irradiation also revealed no changes in the elastic properties, while examination of the corneal structure demonstrated the absence of significant structural changes in irradiated samples compared with intact ones.","[""1 Institute of Photon Technologies, Federal Scientific Research Centre 'Crystallography and Photonics', 2 Pionerskaya St., Moscow, Troitsk, Russian Federation, 142190."", ""2 Image Processing Systems Institute, Federal Scientific Research Centre 'Crystallography and Photonics', Samara, Russian Federation, 443001."", '3 Research Institute of Eye Diseases, 11A Rossolimo St., Moscow, Russian Federation, 119021.', '4 Research Institute of Eye Diseases, 11A Rossolimo St., Moscow, Russian Federation, 119021; I.M.

780,American Society of Biomechanics Journal of Biomechanics Award 2018: Adaptive motor planning of center-of-mass trajectory during goal-directed walking in novel environments,"To aid in the successful execution of goal-directed walking (discrete movement from a start location to an end target) the central nervous system forms a predictive motor plan. For the motor plan to be effective, it must be adapted in response to environmental changes. Despite motor planning being inherent to goal-directed walking, it is not understood how the nervous system adapts these plans to interact with changing environments. Our objective was to understand how people adapt motor plans of center of mass (COM) trajectory during goal-directed walking in response to a consistent change in environmental dynamics. Participants preformed a series of goal-directed walking trials in a novel environment created by a cable robot that applied a lateral force field to their COM. We hypothesized that participants would adapt to the environment by forming an internal model of their COM trajectory within the force field. Our findings support this hypothesis. Initially, we found COM trajectory significantly deviated in the same direction as the applied field, relative to baseline (no field) (p = 0.002). However, with practice in the field, COM trajectory adapted back to the baseline (p = 0.6). When we unexpectedly removed the field, participants demonstrated after-effects, COM trajectory deviated in the direction opposite of the field relative to baseline (p < 0.001). Our findings suggest that when performing a goal-directed walking task, people adapt a motor plan that predicts the COM trajectory that will emerge from the interaction between a specific set of motor commands and the external environment.","['1 Department of Physical Therapy and Human Movement Sciences, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA.

781,Inhibition and assessment of the biophysical gating properties of GluA2 and GluA2/A3 AMPA receptors using curcumin derivatives,"The development of efficacious and safe drugs for the treatment of neurological diseases related to glutamate toxicity has been a focus in neuropharmacological research. Specifically, discovering antagonists to modulate the activity and kinetics of AMPA receptors, which are the fastest ligand-gated ion channels involved in excitatory neurotransmission in response to glutamate. Thus, the current study investigated novel curcumin derivatives on the biophysical properties of AMPA receptors, specifically on the homomeric GluA2 and the heteromeric GluA2/A3 subunits and assessed for inhibitory actions. The biophysical parameter (i.e., desensitization, deactivation, and peak currents) were measured by using whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology with and without the administration of the derivatives onto HEK293 cells. CR-NN, CR-NNPh, CR-MeNH, and CR-NO of the tested derivatives showed inhibition on all AMPA receptors up to 6 folds. Moreover, the inhibitory derivatives also increased desensitization and deactivation, which further intensifies the compounds' neuroprotective effects. However, CR-PhCl, CR-PhF, and CR-PhBr did not show any significant changes on the peak current, deactivation or desensitization rates. By comparison to other discovered and widely used antagonist, the prepared curcumin derivatives are not selective to a specific AMPA subunit, instead implement its effect in the same way between all types of AMPA receptors. Additionally, the obtained results provide derivatives that not only noncompetitively inhibit AMPARs but also decrease its biophysical kinetics, specifically desensitization and deactivation rates. Hence, to potentially serve as a new AMPAR inhibitor with therapeutic potential, the current study provides compounds that are non-selective and non-competitive antagonist, which also effect the desensitization and deactivation rates of the receptor.","['1 Department of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, An-Najah National University, Nablus, Palestine.', '2 Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, An-Najah National University, Nablus, Palestine.', '3 Department of Computer Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, An-Najah National University, Nablus, Palestine.', '4 Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, An-Najah National University, Nablus, Palestine.']","Mohammad Qneibi, Othman Hamed, Abdel-Razzak Natsheh, Oswa Fares, Nidal Jaradat, Nour Emwas, Qais AbuHasan, Rana Al-Kerm, Rola Al-Kerm, ",PloS one,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31454362

Optimized ionization chamber wall thickness was determined through measurements where a flat energy response of the ionization chamber could be established. The measurement shows that the air kerma rate based calibration coefficient for ionization chamber varies up to 45% and ambient dose equivalent rate based calibration coefficient varies up to 20% for wall thickness 1.2-1200 mg/cm2 in the energy range 17.6-213 keV.,"['1 Radiation Safety Systems Division, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Trombay, Mumbai 85, India.', '2 Homi Bhabha National Institute, Anushaktinagar, Mumbai 94, India.']","Sunil K Singh, M S Kulkarni, ",Radiation protection dosimetry,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29660104

786,The effect of realistic geometries on the susceptibility-weighted MR signal in white matter,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      To investigate the effect of realistic microstructural geometry on the susceptibility-weighted MR signal in white matter (WM), with application to demyelination. Methods:
      
    

    
      Previous work has modeled susceptibility-weighted signals under the assumption that axons are cylindrical. In this study, we explored the implications of this assumption by considering the effect of more realistic geometries. A three-compartment WM model incorporating relevant properties based on the literature was used to predict the MR signal. Myelinated axons were modeled with several cross-sectional geometries of increasing realism: nested circles, warped/elliptical circles, and measured axonal geometries from electron micrographs. Signal simulations from the different microstructural geometries were compared with measured signals from a cuprizone mouse model with varying degrees of demyelination. Results:
      
    

    
      Simulation results suggest that axonal geometry affects the MR signal. Predictions with realistic models were significantly different compared with circular models under the same microstructural tissue properties, for simulations with and without diffusion. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The geometry of axons affects the MR signal significantly. Literature estimates of myelin susceptibility, which are based on fitting biophysical models to the MR signal, are likely to be biased by the assumed geometry, as will any derived microstructural properties.

787,"Selective, sensitive, and fast determination of S-layer proteins by a molecularly imprinted photonic polymer coated film and a fiber-optic spectrometer","A newly developed molecularly imprinted photonic polymer (MIPP) film, which was prepared by colloidal crystal templating and surface molecular imprinting, was used for selective capture of S-layer protein (SLP) from a complex Lactobacillus acidophilus sample. The colloidal crystal templates were formed by a dipping process followed by chemical binding of the imprinted template SLP molecules. A sandwich structure consisting of two glass slides was formed after the SLP-silica layer had been covered with a poly(methyl methacrylate) glass slide. After polymerization of the SLP-silica layer with the preprepared polymerization solution, hydrofluoric acid and acetic phosphate buffer solutions removed the silica particles and SLP molecules, respectively. The MIPP film obtained exhibited a three-dimensional, highly ordered and interconnected macroporous structure (pore size greater than 200 nm), which is specifically accessible to SLP molecules. The adsorbed SLP molecules were simply and straightforwardly detected by a fiber-optic spectrometer. The redshift of the Bragg diffraction peak of the MIPP film was linearly related to the number of SLP molecules that had been harvested in the film. The detection limit of the SLP-MMIP-fiber-optic spectrometer method for SLP was 1 ng mL-1. The MIPP sensor was successfully applied to detect SLP molecules in a crudely extracted Lactobacillus acidophilus sample. Our results prove the applicability of the SLP-MIPP film for fast and real-time measurement of SLP.

      The recent rapid increase of hadron therapy applications requires the development of high performance, reliable in vivo models for preclinical research on the biological effects of high linear energy transfer (LET) particle radiation. Aim:
      
    

    
      The aim of this paper was to test the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of the zebrafish embryo system at two neutron facilities. Material and methods:
      
    

    
      Series of viable zebrafish embryos at 24-hour post-fertilization (hpf) were exposed to single fraction, whole-body, photon and neutron (reactor fission neutrons (<En = 1 MeV>) and (p (18 MeV)+Be, <En> = 3.5 MeV) fast neutron) irradiation. The survival and morphologic abnormalities of each embryo were assessed at 24-hour intervals from the point of fertilization up to 192 hpf and then compared to conventional 6 MV photon beam irradiation results. Results:
      
    

    
      The higher energy of the fast neutron beams represents lower RBE (ref. source LINAC 6 MV photon). The lethality rate in the zebrafish embryo model was 10 times higher for 1 MeV fission neutrons and 2.5 times greater for p (18 MeV)+Be cyclotron generated fast neutron beam when compared to photon irradiation results. Dose-dependent organ perturbations (shortening of the body length, spine curvature, microcephaly, micro-ophthalmia, pericardial edema and inhibition of yolk sac resorption) and microscopic (marked cellular changes in eyes, brain, liver, muscle and the gastrointestinal system) changes scale together with the dose response.

789,Technical Note: Comparison of first- and second-generation photon-counting slit-scanning tomosynthesis systems,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is an emerging tool for breast-cancer screening and diagnostics. The purpose of this study is to present a second-generation photon-counting slit-scanning DBT system and compare it to the first-generation system in terms of geometry and image quality. The study presents the first image-quality measurements on the second-generation system. Method:
      
    

    
      The geometry of the new system is based on a combined rotational and linear motion, in contrast to a purely rotational scan motion in the first generation. In addition, the calibration routines have been updated. Image quality was measured in the center of the image field in terms of in-slice modulation transfer function (MTF), artifact spread function (ASF), and in-slice detective quantum efficiency (DQE). Images were acquired using a W/Al 29 kVp spectrum at 13 mAs with 2 mm Al additional filtration and reconstructed using simple back-projection. Result:
      
    

    
      The in-slice 50% MTF was improved in the chest-mammilla direction, going from 3.2 to 3.5 lp/mm, and the zero-frequency DQE increased from 0.71 to 0.77. The MTF and ASF were otherwise found to be on par for the two systems. The new system has reduced in-slice variation of the tomographic angle. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The new geometry is less curved, which reduces in-slice tomographic-angle variation, and increases the maximum compression height, making the system accessible for a larger population. The improvements in MTF and DQE were attributed to the updated calibration procedures. We conclude that the second-generation system maintains the key features of the photon-counting system while maintaining or improving image quality and improving the maximum compression height.","['1 Physics of Medical Imaging, Royal Institute of Technology, AlbaNova University Center, Stockholm, 106 91, Sweden.', '2 Philips Mammography Solutions, Kista, 164 40, Sweden.']","Karl Berggren, Björn Cederström, Mats Lundqvist, Erik Fredenberg, ",Medical physics,2018 Feb,ASF; DQE; MTF; Slit scan; breast tomosynthesis; photon counting.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29265414

Amendments to clinical pathways are obligatory in this perspective to continue to provide the necessary health services to the people who need them, although at the same time, infection control and prevention are not compromised by inadvertent disease transmission or unnecessary use of resources. We aim to provide a guide of the logistic aspects of electrophysiology procedures derived from our tertiary cardiac center during the current COVID-19 pandemic.","['1 From the Cardiology Department, Lancashire Cardiac Centre, Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Blackpool, United Kingdom.']","Dimitrios Katsaras, Shajil Chalil, Khalid Abozguia, ",Critical pathways in cardiology,2020 Sep,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32349045
792,The effects of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) at individual alpha peak frequency (iAPF) on motor cortex excitability in young and elderly adults,"Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) can modulate brain oscillations, cortical excitability and behaviour. In aging, the decrease in EEG alpha activity (8-12 Hz) in the parieto-occipital and mu rhythm in the motor cortex are correlated with the decline in cognitive and motor functions, respectively. Increasing alpha activity using tACS might therefore improve cognitive and motor function in the elderly. The present study explored the influence of tACS on cortical excitability in young and old healthy adults. We applied tACS at individual alpha peak frequency for 10 min (1.5 mA) to the left motor cortex. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to assess the changes in cortical excitability as measured by motor-evoked potentials at rest, before and after stimulation. TACS increased cortical excitability in both groups. However, our results also suggest that the mechanism behind the effects was different, as we observed an increase and decrease in intracortical inhibition in the old group and young group, respectively. Our results indicate that both groups profited similarly from the stimulation. There was no indication that tACS was more effective in conditions of low alpha power, that is, in the elderly.","['1 Institute of Psychology, University of Graz, Graz, Austria. shane.fresnoza@uni-graz.at.', '2 Institute of Physiology, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria. shane.fresnoza@uni-graz.at.', '3 Otto Loewi Research Center, Physiology Section, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.', '4 Department of Physiotherapy, University of Applied Sciences FH-Joanneum Graz, Graz, Austria.', '5 Institute of Psychology, University of Graz, Graz, Austria.', '6 Institute of Physiology, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.', '7 BioTechMed, Graz, Austria.', '8 Faculty of Human Sciences, Medical School Hamburg (MSH), Hamburg, Germany.']","Shane Fresnoza, Monica Christova, Theresa Feil, Eugen Gallasch, Christof Körner, Ulrike Zimmer, Anja Ischebeck, ",Experimental brain research,2018 Oct,Aging; Alpha oscillation; Electroencephalogram; Neuronal entrainment; Transcranial alternating current stimulation; Transcranial magnetic stimulation.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29943239
793,Using wearable sensors to classify subject-specific running biomechanical gait patterns based on changes in environmental weather conditions,"Running-related overuse injuries can result from a combination of various intrinsic (e.g., gait biomechanics) and extrinsic (e.g., running surface) risk factors. However, it is unknown how changes in environmental weather conditions affect running gait biomechanical patterns since these data cannot be collected in a laboratory setting. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop a classification model based on subject-specific changes in biomechanical running patterns across two different environmental weather conditions using data obtained from wearable sensors in real-world environments. Running gait data were recorded during winter and spring sessions, with recorded average air temperatures of -10° C and +6° C, respectively. Classification was performed based on measurements of pelvic drop, ground contact time, braking, vertical oscillation of pelvis, pelvic rotation, and cadence obtained from 66,370 strides (~11,000/runner) from a group of recreational runners. A non-linear and ensemble machine learning algorithm, random forest (RF), was used to classify and compute a heuristic for determining the importance of each variable in the prediction model. To validate the developed subject-specific model, two cross-validation methods (one-against-another and partitioning datasets) were used to obtain experimental mean classification accuracies of 87.18% and 95.42%, respectively, indicating an excellent discriminatory ability of the RF-based model. Additionally, the ranked order of variable importance differed across the individual runners. The results from the RF-based machine-learning algorithm demonstrates that processing gait biomechanical signals from a single wearable sensor can successfully detect changes to an individual's running patterns based on data obtained in real-world environments.","['1 Faculty of Kinesiology, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', '2 Running Injury Clinic, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', '3 Faculty of Nursing, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.']","Nizam Uddin Ahamed, Dylan Kobsar, Lauren Benson, Christian Clermont, Russell Kohrs, Sean T Osis, Reed Ferber, ",PloS one,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30226903

795,Focal Hemodynamic Responses in the Stimulated Hemisphere During High-Definition Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation,"Objective:
      
    

    
      High-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) using a 4 × 1 electrode montage has been previously shown using modeling and physiological studies to constrain the electric field within the spatial extent of the electrodes. The aim of this proof-of-concept study was to determine if functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) neuroimaging can be used to determine a hemodynamic correlate of this 4 × 1 HD-tDCS electric field on the brain. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      In a three session cross-over study design, 13 healthy males received one sham (2 mA, 30 sec) and two real (HD-tDCS-1 and HD-tDCS-2, 2 mA, 10 min) anodal HD-tDCS targeting the left M1 via a 4 × 1 electrode montage (anode on C3 and 4 return electrodes 3.5 cm from anode). The two real HD-tDCS sessions afforded a within-subject replication of the findings. fNIRS was used to measure changes in brain hemodynamics (oxygenated hemoglobin integral-O2 Hbint ) during each 10 min session from two regions of interest (ROIs) in the stimulated left hemisphere that corresponded to ""within"" (Lin ) and ""outside"" (Lout ) the spatial extent of the 4 × 1 electrode montage, and two corresponding ROIs (Rin and Rout ) in the right hemisphere. Results:
      
    

    
      The ANOVA showed that both real anodal HD-tDCS compared to sham induced a significantly greater O2 Hbint in the Lin than Lout ROIs of the stimulated left hemisphere; while there were no significant differences between the real and sham sessions for the right hemisphere ROIs. Intra-class correlation coefficients showed ""fair-to-good"" reproducibility for the left stimulated hemisphere ROIs. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The greater O2 Hbint ""within"" than ""outside"" the spatial extent of the 4 × 1 electrode montage represents a hemodynamic correlate of the electrical field distribution, and thus provides a prospective reliable method to determine the dose of stimulation that is necessary to optimize HD-tDCS parameters in various applications.","['1 EuroMov, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', '2 Institute of Neurology, University College London, London, UK.']","Makii Muthalib, Pierre Besson, John Rothwell, Stéphane Perrey, ",Neuromodulation : journal of the International Neuromodulation Society,2018 Jun,Blood flow; electric field; fNIRS; motor cortex stimulation; tDCS.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28714545

      We investigated the acute effect of short pulse widths on the therapeutic window in subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease. Methods:
      
    

    
      We assessed 10 PD patients with STN-DBS at a 60-µs pulse width. We randomly and double-blindedly applied 10- to 50-µs pulse widths. The principal outcome was the therapeutic window (difference between the amplitude thresholds for visible muscle contraction and for best rigidity control). The secondary outcome was the charge per pulse (which reflects the efficiency of the stimulation) needed to control rigidity. Two-way analysis of variance and pairwise t tests were applied. Results:
      
    

    
      The therapeutic window widened when the pulse width shortened (r = -0.45; P < 0.001), and charge per pulse was reduced (P < 0.05). Conclusions:

797,Stereospecific modulation of dimeric rhodopsin,"The classic concept that GPCRs function as monomers has been challenged by the emerging evidence of GPCR dimerization and oligomerization. Rhodopsin (Rh) is the only GPCR whose native oligomeric arrangement was revealed by atomic force microscopy demonstrating that Rh exists as a dimer. However, the role of Rh dimerization in retinal physiology is currently unknown. In this study, we identified econazole and sulconazole, two small molecules that disrupt Rh dimer contacts, by implementing a cell-based high-throughput screening assay. Racemic mixtures of identified lead compounds were separated and tested for their stereospecific binding to Rh using UV-visible spectroscopy and intrinsic fluorescence of tryptophan (Trp) 265 after illumination. By following the changes in UV-visible spectra and Trp265 fluorescence in vitro, we found that binding of R-econazole modulates the formation of Meta III and quenches the intrinsic fluorescence of Trp265. In addition, electrophysiological ex vivo recording revealed that R-econazole slows photoresponse kinetics, whereas S-econazole decreased the sensitivity of rods without effecting the kinetics. Thus, this study contributes new methodology to identify compounds that disrupt the dimerization of GPCRs in general and validates the first active compounds that disrupt the Rh dimer specifically.-Getter, T., Gulati, S., Zimmerman, R., Chen, Y., Vinberg, F., Palczewski, K.

      The purpose of the study was to investigate the characteristics of the parafoveal cone density changes in patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP) using adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (AO-SLO). Methods:
      
    

    
      A total of 14 eyes of RP patients and 10 eyes of control subjects were examined. High-resolution images of cone photoreceptor cells were obtained with a Canon AO-SLO system in the four retinal regions of the superior, inferior, temporal, and nasal areas located 1.0 mm from the central fovea. The relationships of cone density with optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings and the visual sensitivity of the static perimetry tests were analyzed in RP patients. Results:
      
    

    
      The averaged cone densities in RP patients were decreased at 1.0 mm eccentricity from the fovea (11,899 cells/mm2) compared with those in control subjects (16,647 cells/mm2; P < 0.01). The cone density was substantially decreased even in RP patients with an intact interdigitation zone at the examined area (12,865 cells/mm2; P < 0.01 vs. controls) and preserved visual sensitivity with > 35 dB (13,019 cells/mm2; P < 0.001 vs. controls). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      In RP, cone photoreceptor cell loss occurred in the parafoveal region with a preserved EZ/IZ or visual sensitivity.

799,Acetylcholinesterase-functionalized two-dimensional photonic crystal for the sensing of G-series nerve agents,"G-series nerve agents, such as sarin, tabun, and soman, would cause tremendous harm in military and terrorist attacks, so it is necessary to develop a simple method for the rapid and efficient detection of these hazardous substances. We have developed a tunable acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-functionalized two-dimensional photonic crystal (2D PhC) for the detection of a real nerve agent, sarin. In accordance with the 2D PhC previously prepared by our group, the AChE-functionalized 2D PhC was optimized by adjustment of the amount of monomer in the hydrogel, which not only increased the sensitivity of the 2D PhC, with the detection limit decreasing by two orders of magnitude, but also ensured the structural color spanned the whole visible region in the detection range. A linear relationship between the logarithm of the sarin concentration and the particle spacing of the AChE-functionalized 2D PhC was observed from 7.1 × 10-17 to 7.1 × 10-4 mol/L. The AChE-functionalized 2D PhC also responded to mimics of G-series nerve agents, including dimethyl methylphosphonate, diisopropyl methylphosphonate, and isodipropyl methylphosphonate, to various degrees. The proposed 2D-PhC hydrogel has potential for low-cost, trace-level, and on-site monitoring of other G-series nerve agents.

However, translation of mass spectrometry-based proteomics methods to directly profile the interaction between a small molecule and the whole proteome is challenging because of the substoichiometric nature of many interactions, the diversity of covalent and noncovalent interactions involved, and the subsequent computational complexity associated with their spectral assignment. Recent advances in chemical proteomics have begun fill this gap to provide a structural basis for the breadth of small molecule-protein interactions in the whole proteome. Innovations enabling direct characterization of the small molecule interactome include faster, more sensitive instrumentation coupled to chemical conjugation, enrichment, and labeling methods that facilitate detection and assignment. These methods have started to measure molecular interaction hotspots due to inherent differences in local amino acid reactivity and binding affinity throughout the proteome. Measurement of the small molecule interactome is producing structural insights and methods for probing and engineering protein biochemistry. Direct structural characterization of the small molecule interactome is a rapidly emerging area pushing new frontiers in biochemistry at the interface of small molecules and the proteome.","['1 Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Harvard University , 12 Oxford Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138, United States.']","Hope A Flaxman, Christina M Woo, ",Biochemistry,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29083874

The quantum interference effects make it possible to use the high generation efficiency of the polarization-entangled photons to process parametric down-conversion, and separate degenerated photon pairs into different optical modes without a postselection requirement. The principle of the optical system was described and experimentally used to measure the fidelity and Bell parameters, and also to characterize the generated polarization-entangled photons from a minimum of six combinations of polarization correlated data. The experimentally obtained fidelity and Bell parameters exceeded the classical local correlation limit and are clear evidence of the generation of unconditional polarization-entangled photons.","['1 Department of Physics, Tokyo University of Science.', '2 Department of Physics, Tokyo University of Science; sanaka@rs.tus.ac.jp.']","Haruka Terashima, Yoshiro Sato, Satoshi Kobayashi, Takaho Tsubakiyama, Ryo Nozaki, Satoshi Kubo, Tomo Osada, Kaoru Sanaka, ",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31545323
809,Real-Time Neurofeedback to Modulate β-Band Power in the Subthalamic Nucleus in Parkinson's Disease Patients,"The β-band oscillation in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a therapeutic target for Parkinson's disease. Previous studies demonstrated that l-DOPA decreases the β-band (13-30 Hz) oscillations with improvement of motor symptoms. However, it has not been elucidated whether patients with Parkinson's disease are able to control the β-band oscillation voluntarily. Here, we hypothesized that neurofeedback training to control the β-band power in the STN induces plastic changes in the STN of individuals with Parkinson's disease. We recorded the signals from STN deep-brain stimulation electrodes during operations to replace implantable pulse generators in eight human patients (3 male) with bilateral electrodes. Four patients were induced to decrease the β-band power during the feedback training (down-training condition), whereas the other patients were induced to increase (up-training condition). All patients were blinded to their assigned condition. Adjacent contacts that showed the highest β-band power were selected for the feedback. During the 10 min training, patients were shown a circle whose diameter was controlled by the β-band power of the selected contacts. Powers in the β-band during 5 min resting sessions recorded before and after the feedback were compared. In the down-training condition, the β-band power of the selected contacts decreased significantly after feedback in all four patients (p < 0.05). In contrast, the β-band power significantly increased after feedback in two of four patients in the up-training condition. Overall, the patients could voluntarily control the β-band power in STN in the instructed direction (p < 0.05) through neurofeedback.","['1 Department of Neurosurgery, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, 565-0871, Japan.', '2 Department of Neuroinformatics, ATR Computational Neuroscience Laboratories, Seika-cho, Kyoto, 619-0288, Japan.', '3 Institute for Advanced Co-creation Studies, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, 565-0871, Japan.', '4 Center for Information and Neural Networks (CiNet), National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT), Suita, Osaka, 565-0871, Japan.', '5 JST PRESTO, Suita, Osaka, 565-0871, Japan.', '6 Department of Neuromodulation and Neurosurgery, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, 565-0871, Japan.']","Ryohei Fukuma, Takufumi Yanagisawa, Masataka Tanaka, Fumiaki Yoshida, Koichi Hosomi, Satoru Oshino, Naoki Tani, Haruhiko Kishima, ",eNeuro,2018,EEG; Parkinson disease; beta power; deep brain stimulation; neurofeedback; voluntary control.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30627648
810,"Dose point kernels for 2,174 radionuclides","Purpose:
      
    

    
      Rapid adoption of targeted radionuclide therapy as an oncologic intervention has motivated the development of patient-specific voxel-wise approaches to radiation dosimetry. These approaches often rely on pretabulated dose point kernels for convolution-based calculations; however, these dose kernels are sparse in literature and often have suboptimal characteristics. The purpose of this work was to generate an extensive library of dose point kernels with sufficient size and resolution for general clinical application of voxel-wise dosimetry. Methods:
      
    

    
      Nuclear data were acquired for 2174 radionuclides from the National Nuclear Data Center (Brookhaven National Laboratory, accessed March 2018). Based on these data, isotropic point sources of radioactivity in water were simulated using Monte Carlo N-Particle transport v6.2 (MCNP6.2, Los Alamos National Laboratory). Simulations were separated by emission type for each radionuclide - photons (γ-rays, x rays), beta particles (positrons, electrons); and discrete electrons (conversion electrons, Auger electrons, Coster-Kronig electrons). Dose was tallied in concentric spherical shells about the point source using an energy deposition pulse-height tally (MCNP *F8 tally). Bins were spaced every 0.1 mm until a radius of 10 cm, and every 1 mm until a radius of 2 m. Positron emissions where treated as electrons for transport, with annihilation photons generated at the origin within the photon simulation. Alpha particle emissions were not simulated since their energy is deposited within ~0.2 mm of the source. Neutron and spallation effects were not considered. A subset of the resultant dose point kernels (11 C, 18 F, 32 P, 52g Mn, 64 Cu, 67 Ga, 89 Sr, 89 Zr, 90 Y, 99m Tc, 111 In, 117m Sn, 123 I, 124 I, 125 I, 131 I, 153 Sm, 177 Lu, 186 Re, 188 Re, 211 As, 212 Pb, 213 Bi, 223 Ra, and 225 Ac) were evaluated for accuracy based on conservation of energy, comparison to kernels in the literature, and statistical precision. Results:
      
    

    
      Among dose point kernels that were manually reviewed, good agreement with previously published dose point kernels was observed. Energy within the kernels was found to be conserved to within 1% of the value expected from nuclear data, suggesting that a radius of 2 m was sufficient to capture the almost all of the energy released during decay for all isotopes considered. Local dosimetric uncertainty, evaluated at the radius of 99% energy deposition, was found to be less than 9% for all radioisotopes evaluated. Rebinning data more coarsely by a factor of 10, similar to what would be done for a clinical dose calculation, results in all evaluated kernels having a relative error of less than 1.1% at R50% , 1.5% at R90% , and 2.7% at R99% (the radius corresponding to 50%, 90%, and 99% of total energy deposition, respectively). The kernels produced in this work have been made freely available (https://zenodo.org/record/2564036). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      An extensive library of high-resolution radial dose kernels was generated and validated against published data. In addition to enabling patient-specific voxel-wise internal dosimetry by convolution superposition, the generated dose point kernels data may prove useful to the wider health physics community.","['1 Department of Radiology, University of Iowa, 3883 JPP, 200 Hawkins Dr., Iowa City, IA, 52242-1077, USA.', '2 Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Iowa, LL-W PFP, 200 Hawkins Dr., Iowa City, IA, 52242-1089, USA.']","Stephen A Graves, Ryan T Flynn, Daniel E Hyer, ",Medical physics,2019 Nov,MCNP; radiopharmaceuticals; targeted radionuclide therapy; theranostics; voxel-wise dosimetry.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31461537

In two 4-hr laboratory sessions, students assess the suitability of bulls for inclusion in a gene-assisted selection program for A2 β-casein by genotyping commercial bull sperm. Sperm cells are lysed to extract the genomic DNA, and PCR with primers for the β-casein gene is performed. Using the principle of amplification-created restriction sites, restriction digestion with TaqI can be used to distinguish between the A1 allele and the A2 allele of the gene.

813,Commissioning of a water calorimeter as a primary standard for absorbed dose to water in magnetic fields,"MRI guided radiotherapy devices are currently in clinical use. Detector responses are affected by the magnetic field and need to be characterized in terms of absorbed dose to water, D w, against primary standards under these conditions. The aim of this study was to commission a water calorimeter, accepted as the Dutch national standard for D w in MV photons and to validate its claimed standard uncertainty of 0.37% in the 7 MV photon beam of a pre-clinical MRI-linac in a 1.5 T magnetic field. To evaluate the primary standard on a fundamental basis, realisation of D w at 1.5 T was evaluated parameter by parameter. A thermodynamic description was given to demonstrate potential temperature effects due to the magneto-caloric effect (MCE). Methods were developed for measurement of depth, variation in detector distance and beam output in the bore of the MRI-linac. This resulted in D w measurements with a magnetic field of 1.5 T and, after ramp-down, without magnetic field. It was shown that the measurement of ΔT w and calorimeter corrections are either independent of or can be determined in a magnetic field. The chemical heat defect, h, was considered zero within its stated uncertainty, as for 0 T. Evaluation of the MCE and measurements done during magnet ramp-down, indicated no changes in the specific heat capacity of water. However, variations of the applied monitor system increased the uncertainty on beam output normalization. This study confirmed that the uncertainty for measurement of D w with a water calorimeter in a 1.5 T magnetic field is estimated to be the same as under conventional reference conditions. The VSL water calorimeter can be applied as a primary standard for D w in magnetic fields and is currently the only primary standard operable in a magnetic field that provides direct access to the international traceability framework.","['1 VSL-Dutch Metrology Institute, Delft, The Netherlands.

814,Immobilized enzyme-based analytical tools in the -omics era: Recent advances,"Protein analysis is a field under rapid development mainly thanks to technological advances which have granted miniaturization of analytical devices, automation and higher detection sensitivity. The interest in the field has paralleled the expansion of the -omics era, laying down the bases for the current applications in proteomics and glycomics. Advances in protein sample transformation prior to analysis have led to reduction of sample consumption and contamination, enhancing throughput. Within this context, and thanks to the availability of new high performing materials and technologies, increasingly more efficient and miniaturized enzyme-based analytical tools have been proposed to overcome shortcomings encountered in the in-solution enzymatic reactions (protein digestion and protein deglycosylation, for proteomics and glycomics, respectively). In this context, immobilized enzyme reactors (IMERs) and IMER-based platforms have been developed as promising approaches toward automation and higher analysis throughput. The scenario is in continuous development as underlined by thirty-four papers published in the last five years. This review encompasses recent advances in the design and operational set-ups of IMERs purposely developed for the analysis of proteins and glycoproteins. Recently developed dual IMERs, which integrate more than one processing step into a single IMER, and analytical platforms exploiting tandem IMERs are also reviewed and commented.","['1 Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology, Alma Mater Studiorum - University of Bologna, Via Belmeloro 6, 40126 Bologna, Italy; Center for Applied Biomedical Research (C.R.B.A.), S.

Proteases being the second largest group of enzymes in humans present themselves as attractive targets for blocking and activation to treat malignancies. However, determination of the protease cleavage substrates is often missed by utilizing conventional modern proteomic approaches. The relatively low abundance of proteolytically processed, and mostly semi-tryptic, peptides compared to tryptic peptides generated in shotgun proteomics compounded with their poorer identification rates makes the identification of such critical peptides challenging and so are mostly overlooked. Our laboratory introduced Terminal Amine Isotopic Labeling of Substrates (TAILS) to identify N-terminal peptides from cleavage events.

We demonstrate this robustness against photon flux used in calibration, spectral errors such as pulse pile-up as well as the detector's inherent spectral resolution limits. The demonstrated significant insensitivity of the proposed DIR signature to detector spectral distortions and energy resolution is a key finding.

821,Longitudinal curriculum development: gradual optimization of a biochemistry seminar,"Objective: The Master Plan for Medical Studies 2020 places additional emphasis on curricular development processes. In addition, institutes may recognize a need to optimize their courses, for example because of poor evaluations. Frequently, however, the resources required for comprehensive optimizations are not available. In the present study, we aimed to use the example of a biochemistry seminar that takes place in the preclinical part of the medical degree at Ulm University Medical School to show how a course can be successfully optimized in small steps and evaluation results can be used for quality assurance. Methods: Similar to a continuous improvement process (CIP), over the course of five years a biochemistry seminar was gradually optimized in three steps. This process used structural, methodological, and content components, such as vertical integration, the inverted classroom method, and competence orientation. For quality assurance, we analyzed the official, standardized evaluation sheets from a total of n=1248 students. We evaluated the optimization process on the basis of responses to evaluation statements that were arranged into categories such as ""organization, structure, implementation"" and ""quality of teaching,"" free text information, and the results of a pilot study conducted in parallel. We then determined the usefulness of the students' evaluation results for evaluating the optimization process. Results: Each developmental step resulted in a significantly more positive overall evaluation of the seminar by the students. This result was independent of whether the development was on a structural or methodological/content-related level. In addition, the evaluations of the categories that were optimized were significantly better. For example, the vertical integration and introduction of the inverted classroom method were accompanied by a better evaluation of the ""quality of teaching"" and a change in the structure led to a higher score in the category ""organization, structure, implementation."" A comparison with the free text evaluation sheets and the results of the pilot study supports the results. Conclusion: Although optimization of a curriculum or course is a major task, it can also be successfully completed in small steps. With this approach, new learning goals, for example as required in the Master Plan for Medical Studies 2020, can be continuously integrated and student satisfaction with a course can be increased. Student evaluation results can represent a kind of quality assurance in this process and can provide important impulses for optimization.","['1 Ulm University, Institute for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Ulm, Germany.']","Achim Schneider, Michael Kühl, Susanne J Kühl, ",GMS journal for medical education,2019,biochemistry; competence orientation; course development; curriculum development; flipped classroom; inverted classroom; quality management; vertical integration.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31844645

Each construct underwent cyclic loading from 5 to 30 N for 20 cycles, followed by tensile testing to failure. The ultimate failure load and linear stiffness were measured. Findings:

However, efforts have largely been invested in implementations in the electrical domain with potential limitations of switching speed, packing density of large integrated systems and interconnect losses. As an alternative, neuromorphic engineering in the photonic domain has recently gained attention. In this work, we propose a purely photonic operation of an Integrate-and-Fire Spiking neuron, based on the phase change dynamics of Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) embedded on top of a microring resonator, which alleviates the energy constraints of PCMs in electrical domain. We also show that such a neuron can be potentially integrated with on-chip synapses into an all-Photonic Spiking Neural network inferencing framework which promises to be ultrafast and can potentially offer a large operating bandwidth.","['1 Purdue University, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, USA. ichakra@purdue.edu.', '2 Purdue University, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, USA.']","Indranil Chakraborty, Gobinda Saha, Abhronil Sengupta, Kaushik Roy, ",Scientific reports,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30154507

825,The biophysical role of hemodynamics in the pathogenesis of cerebral aneurysm formation and rupture,"The pathogenesis of intracranial aneurysms remains complex and multifactorial. While vascular, genetic, and epidemiological factors play a role, nascent aneurysm formation is believed to be induced by hemodynamic forces. Hemodynamic stresses and vascular insults lead to additional aneurysm and vessel remodeling. Advanced imaging techniques allow us to better define the roles of aneurysm and vessel morphology and hemodynamic parameters, such as wall shear stress, oscillatory shear index, and patterns of flow on aneurysm formation, growth, and rupture. While a complete understanding of the interplay between these hemodynamic variables remains elusive, the authors review the efforts that have been made over the past several decades in an attempt to elucidate the physical and biological interactions that govern aneurysm pathophysiology. Furthermore, the current clinical utility of hemodynamics in predicting aneurysm rupture is discussed.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Sauson Soldozy, Pedro Norat, Mazin Elsarrag, Ajay Chatrath, John S Costello, Jennifer D Sokolowski, Petr Tvrdik, M Yashar S Kalani, Min S Park, ",Neurosurgical focus,2019,AR = aspect ratio; BA = basilar artery; CFD = computational fluid dynamics; ECM = extracellular matrix; IA = intracranial aneurysm; IEL = internal elastic lamina; IL = interleukin; IgG = immunoglobulin G; IgM = immunoglobulin M; MCP = monocyte chemoattractant protein; MMP = matrix metalloproteinase; MRA = MR angiography; MWSS = maximum WSS; NO = nitric oxide; OSI = oscillatory shear index; SMC = smooth-muscle cell; SR = size ratio; TNF = tumor necrosis factor; VCAM = vascular cell adhesion molecule; VSMC = vascular SMC; WSS = wall shear stress; WSSG = WSS gradient; cerebral aneurysm; computational fluid dynamics; hemodynamics; vascular remodeling; wall shear stress.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31261115
826,Key developments that impacted the field of mechanobiology and mechanotransduction,"Advances in mechanobiology have evolved through insights from multiple disciplines including structural engineering, biomechanics, vascular biology, and orthopaedics. In this paper, we reviewed the impact of key reports related to the study of applied loads on tissues and cells and the resulting signal transduction pathways. We addressed how technology has helped advance the burgeoning field of mechanobiology (over 33,600 publications from 1970 to 2016). We analyzed the impact of critical ideas and then determined how these concepts influenced the mechanobiology field by looking at the citation frequency of these reports as well as tracking how the overall number of citations within the field changed over time. These data allowed us to understand how a key publication, idea, or technology guided or enabled the field. Initial observations of how forces acted on bone and soft tissues stimulated the development of computational solutions defining how forces affect tissue modeling and remodeling. Enabling technologies, such as cell and tissue stretching, compression, and shear stress devices, allowed more researchers to explore how deformation and fluid flow affect cells. Observation of the cell as a tensegrity structure and advanced methods to study genetic regulation in cells further advanced knowledge of specific mechanisms of mechanotransduction. The future of the field will involve developing gene and drug therapies to simulate or augment beneficial load regimens in patients and in mechanically conditioning organs for implantation. Here, we addressed a history of the field, but we limited our discussions to advances in musculoskeletal mechanobiology, primarily in bone, tendon, and ligament tissues. © 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society.

827,In Vitro Analysis of Cyanobacterial Nonheme Iron-Dependent Aliphatic Halogenases WelO5 and AmbO5,"Aliphatic carbon-halogen (C-X) bonds are prevalent in modern pharmaceuticals and bioactive natural products. Three distinct chemical strategies are known in Nature to generate these structural motifs. The first is via the nucleophilic substitution at a prefunctionalized electrophilic carbon center with a halide anion (X-), known for the S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent halogenases. The second is via the electrophilic activation of an alkene or its equivalent by a halenium ion (X+) donor, known for the haloperoxidases and flavin-dependent halogenases. The third is via the direct functionalization of an unactivated aliphatic C-H bond with a halogen radical (X) equivalent, known for the 2-oxo-glutarate and nonheme iron-dependent halogenases. Due to the ubiquitous nature of aliphatic C-H groups in organic molecules, transformations that permit chemo-, regio-, and stereo-selective modification(s) at an unactivated sp3-carbon center have been a long sought-after goal in chemical science. Two nonheme iron-dependent halogenases, WelO5 and AmbO5 involved in the biogenesis of cyanobacterial hapalindole-type alkaloids, have been recently shown able to perform this type of challenging transformation. In this chapter, experimental details for the in vitro reconstitution of WelO5 and AmbO5 enzymatic activities are presented.","['1 University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, United States.

828,Cracking the Function of Layers in the Sensory Cortex,"Understanding how cortical activity generates sensory perceptions requires a detailed dissection of the function of cortical layers. Despite our relatively extensive knowledge of their anatomy and wiring, we have a limited grasp of what each layer contributes to cortical computation. We need to develop a theory of cortical function that is rooted solidly in each layer's component cell types and fine circuit architecture and produces predictions that can be validated by specific perturbations. Here we briefly review the progress toward such a theory and suggest an experimental road map toward this goal. We discuss new methods for the all-optical interrogation of cortical layers, for correlating in vivo function with precise identification of transcriptional cell type, and for mapping local and long-range activity in vivo with synaptic resolution. The new technologies that can crack the function of cortical layers are finally on the immediate horizon.","['1 Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA; The Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.

Cells not only respond to definitively mechanical cues from the extracellular matrix (ECM) but can also sometimes alter the mechanical properties of the matrix and hence influence subsequent matrix-based cues in both physiological and pathological processes. Interactions between cells and materials in vitro can modify cell phenotype and ECM structure, whether intentionally or inadvertently. Interactions between cell and matrix mechanics in vivo are of particular importance in a wide variety of disorders, including cancer, central nervous system injury, fibrotic diseases, and myocardial infarction.

833,Feasibility of using a fully immersive virtual reality system for kinematic data collection,"Commercially-available Virtual Reality (VR) systems have the potential to be effective tools for simultaneous visual manipulation and kinematic data collection. Previously, these systems have been integrated with research-grade motion capture systems to provide both functionalities; however, they are yet to be used as stand-alone systems for kinematic data collection. The present study aimed to validate the HTC VIVE VR system for kinematic data collection by evaluating the accuracy of its position and orientation signals. The VIVE controller and tracker were each compared to a Polhemus Liberty magnetic tracking system sensor for angular and translational measurement error and signal drift. A sensor from each system was mounted to opposite ends of a rigid segment which was driven through fifty rotations and fifty translations. Mean angular errors for both the VIVE tracker and controller were below 0.4°. Mean translational error for both sensors was below 3 mm. Drift in the Liberty signal components was consistently lower than drift in VIVE components. However, all mean rotational drift measures were below 0.1° and all mean translational measures were below 0.35 mm. These data indicate that the HTC VIVE system has the potential to be a valid and reliable means of kinematic data collection. However, further investigation is necessary to determine the VIVE's suitability for capturing extremely minute or high-volume movements.","['1 Department of Human Physiology, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR, USA.', '2 Department of Human Physiology, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR, USA.

836,Joining the dots between omics and environmental management,"With the rapid advancement of DNA sequencing technologies and the substantial reduction of their running costs, environmental genomics and transcriptomics become more affordable and popular in environmental toxicology. In parallel, there are also speedy improvements of mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry, enabling high-throughput analyses of proteins and metabolites in biological samples and promoting research studies in proteomics and metabolomics. By applying these high-throughput omics technologies, researchers can quickly generate an unprecedentedly vast amount of biological data that may be useful to environmental management. However, the current pace of applying omics information in environmental management is still very slow, and lags well behind the rapid development of omics-based research. This timely commentary, therefore, calls for joint efforts to increase this pace and join the dots between omics and environmental management, turning omics into practical tools. Herein, I explore how omics can contribute to risk assessment and management of chemicals, and recommend what we can do to facilitate and promote the use of omics information in environmental management.

837,Microelectrode Impalement Method to Record Membrane Potential from a Cannulated Middle Cerebral Artery,"Membrane potential (Vm) of vascular smooth muscle cells determines vessel tone and thus blood flow to an organ. Changes in the expression and function of ion channels and electrogenic pumps that regulate Vm in disease conditions could potentially alter Vm, vascular tone, and blood flow. Thus, a basic understanding of electrophysiology and the methods necessary to accurately record Vm in healthy and diseased states are essential. This method will allow modulating Vm using different pharmacological agents to restore Vm. Although there are several methods, each with its advantages and disadvantages, this article provides protocols to record Vm from cannulated resistance vessels such as the middle cerebral artery using the microelectrode impalement method. Middle cerebral arteries are allowed to gain myogenic tone in a myograph chamber, and the vessel wall is impaled using high resistance microelectrodes. The Vm signal is collected through an electrometer, digitized, and analyzed. This method provides an accurate reading of the Vm of a vessel wall without damaging the cells and without changing the membrane resistance.","['1 Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Mississippi Medical Center.', '2 Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Mississippi Medical Center; MPabbidi@umc.edu.']","Joey T Reed, Sumit P Sontakke, Mallikarjuna R Pabbidi, ",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31329167

840,Another look at matrix correlations,"Motivation:
      
    

    
      High throughput technologies are widely employed in modern biomedical research. They yield measurements of a large number of biomolecules in a single experiment. The number of experiments usually is much smaller than the number of measurements in each experiment. The simultaneous measurements of biomolecules provide a basis for a comprehensive, systems view for describing relevant biological processes. Often it is necessary to determine correlations between the data matrices under different conditions or pathways. However, the techniques for analyzing the data with a low number of samples for possible correlations within or between conditions are still in development. Earlier developed correlative measures, such as the RV coefficient, use the trace of the product of data matrices as the most relevant characteristic. However, a recent study has shown that the RV coefficient consistently overestimates the correlations in the case of low sample numbers. To correct for this bias, it was suggested to discard the diagonal elements of the outer products of each data matrix. In this work, a principled approach based on the matrix decomposition generates three trace-independent parts for every matrix. These components are unique, and they are used to determine different aspects of correlations between the original datasets. Results:
      
    

    
      Simulations show that the decomposition results in the removal of high correlation bias and the dependence on the sample number intrinsic to the RV coefficient. We then use the correlations to analyze a real proteomics dataset. Availability and implementation:

841,Advances in Research on Diabetes by Human Nutriomics,"The incidence and prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) have increased rapidly worldwide over the last two decades. Because the pathogenic factors of DM are heterogeneous, determining clinically effective treatments for DM patients is difficult. Applying various nutrient analyses has yielded new insight and potential treatments for DM patients. In this review, we summarized the omics analysis methods, including nutrigenomics, nutritional-metabolomics, and foodomics. The list of the new targets of SNPs, genes, proteins, and gut microbiota associated with DM has been obtained by the analysis of nutrigenomics and microbiomics within last few years, which provides a reference for the diagnosis of DM. The use of nutrient metabolomics analysis can obtain new targets of amino acids, lipids, and metal elements, which provides a reference for the treatment of DM. Foodomics analysis can provide targeted dietary strategies for DM patients. This review summarizes the DM-associated molecular biomarkers in current applied omics analyses and may provide guidance for diagnosing and treating DM.","['1 Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Food Nutrition and Human Health, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China.

842,Model-based optimized phase-deviation deep brain stimulation for Parkinson 's disease,"High-frequency deep brain stimulation (HF-DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN), globus pallidus interna (GPi) and globus pallidus externa (GPe) are often considered as effective methods for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the stimulation of a single nucleus by HF-DBS can cause specific physical damage, produce side effects and usually consume more electrical energy. Therefore, we use a biophysically-based model of basal ganglia-thalamic circuits to explore more effective stimulation patterns to reduce adverse effects and save energy. In this paper, we computationally investigate the combined DBS of two nuclei with the phase deviation between two stimulation waveforms (CDBS). Three different stimulation combination strategies are proposed, i.e., STN and GPe CDBS (SED), STN and GPi CDBS (SID), as well as GPi and GPe CDBS (GGD). Resultantly, it is found that anti-phase CDBS is more effective in improving parkinsonian dynamical properties, including desynchronization of neurons and the recovery of the thalamus relay ability. Detailed simulation investigation shows that anti-phase SED and GGD are superior to SID. Besides, the energy consumption can be largely reduced by SED and GGD (72.5% and 65.5%), compared to HF-DBS. These results provide new insights into the optimal stimulation parameter and target choice of PD, which may be helpful for the clinical practice.","['1 Department of Dynamics and Control, Beihang University, 100191, Beijing, China.', '2 Department of Dynamics and Control, Beihang University, 100191, Beijing, China.

The two groups were evaluated before and 2 years after the procedure using Corvis ST (Oculus Optikgeräte GmbH, Germany) and DCR parameters such as deformation amplitude ratio at 1 mm and 2 mm (DA ratio-1 mm and DA ratio-2 mm) and integrated radius and stiffness parameters at A1 (SP-A1). Two-year follow-up was completed for 16 of the 30 eyes in the 5-min group and 21 of the 25 eyes in the 10-min group; data from those who were lost to follow-up was not included in the analyses. Mean age at baseline was 21.7 ± 4.9 and 21.5 ± 5.2 years in the 5- and 10-min groups, respectively (P = 0.895). At 2 years after CXL, in the 5-min group, the reduction in integrated radius (-1.12 ± 1.27 mm, P = 0.003) was significant, and the increase in SP-A1 (7.11 ± 14.86 mmHg/mm, P = 0.075) was borderline, while in the 10-min group, the decrease in DA ratio-2 mm (-0.43 ± 0.58, P = 0.003) and integrated radius (-1.89 ± 1.72 mm, P < 0.001), and increase in SP-A1 (7.67 ± 10.92 mmHg/mm, P = 0.004) were significant. In both groups, the strongest and significant correlation was observed between DCR parameters and changes in radius of curvature. In conclusion, results indicated corneal strengthening with both protocols especially with the 9 mW/cm2. Corvis ST indices can provide ""in vivo"" biomechanical evidence on the efficacy of CXL that may occur prior to clinical indices.","['1 Noor Research Center for Ophthalmic Epidemiology, Noor Eye Hospital, Tehran, Iran.', '2 Rio de Janeiro Corneal Tomography and Biomechanics Study Group, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; Federal University of the State of Rio de Janeiro (UNIRIO), Brazil.', ""3 St Paul's Eye Unit, Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospital, Liverpool, United Kingdom."", '4 Humanitas University, Department of Biomedical Sciences, Pieve Emanuele Milan, Italy; Humanitas Clinical and Research, Rozzano, Italy.', '5 Department of Ophthalmology & Visual Science, Department of Biomedical Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', '6 Eye Research Center, Farabi Eye Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', '7 Noor Ophthalmology Research Center, Noor Eye Hospital, Tehran, Iran.

Interferometric configurations furthermore enable a simple, fixed-wavelength read-out making them particularly suitable for low-cost diagnostic and monitoring devices. Their limit of detection, i.e., the lowest analyte concentration that can be reliably observed, mainly depends on the sensors response to small refractive index changes, and the noise in the read-out system. While enhancements in the sensors response have been extensively studied, noise optimization has received much less attention. Here we show that order-of-magnitude enhancements in the limit of detection can be achieved through systematic noise reduction, and demonstrate a limit of detection of ∼ 10 - 8 RIU with a silicon nitride sensor operating at telecom wavelengths.","['1 Bionand Center for Nanomedicine and Biotechnology, Parque Tecnológico de Andalucía, 29590 Málaga, Spain. jonas.leuermann@uma.es.', '2 Department de Ingeniería de Comunicaciones, Universidad de Málaga, ETSI Telecomunicación, Campus de Teatinos, 29071 Málaga, Spain. jonas.leuermann@uma.es.', '3 Departamento de Física, Universidad de Oviedo, C/Federico García Lorca, 33007 Oviedo, Spain.', '4 Department de Ingeniería de Comunicaciones, Universidad de Málaga, ETSI Telecomunicación, Campus de Teatinos, 29071 Málaga, Spain.', '5 Department de Ingeniería Mecánica, Universidad de Málaga, Térmica y de Fluidos, Escuela de Ingenierías Industriales, Campus de Teatinos, 29071 Málaga, Spain.', '6 Nanobiosensors and Bioanalytical Applications Group, Catalan Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (ICN2), CSIC, BIST and CIBER-BBN Campus UAB, 08193 Barcelona, Spain.', '7 Bionand Center for Nanomedicine and Biotechnology, Parque Tecnológico de Andalucía, 29590 Málaga, Spain.']","Jonas Leuermann, Adrián Fernández-Gavela, Antonia Torres-Cubillo, Sergio Postigo, Alejandro Sánchez-Postigo, Laura M Lechuga, Robert Halir, Íñigo Molina-Fernández, ","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019,biosensors; coherent detection; interferometer; limit of detection; silicon photonics.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31450817

This work proposes a method to accelerate the simulations based on fixed forced detection (FFD) combined with an analytical response of the detector. FFD is based on a Monte-Carlo simulation but forces the detection of a photon in each detector pixel weighted by the probability of emission (or scattering) and transmission to this pixel. The method was evaluated with numerical phantoms and on patient images. We obtained differences with analog Monte Carlo lower than the statistical uncertainty. The overall computing time gain can reach up to five orders of magnitude.

Eriksson does not acknowledge that the quality of the rat liver tissues in our chronic Roundup toxicity study has neither been questioned nor branded as unsuitable for further investigation. In addition, Eriksson fails to appreciate that the statistical methods we used to analyse the liver metabolomics dataset are recognised as appropriate as some of a number of approaches that can be taken. Moreover, Eriksson neglects to mention that the proteomics analysis of the liver tissues highlights structural and functional damage from Roundup exposure. Thus our results are sound and the claims by Eriksson and colleagues of experimental flaws are unfounded.Replying to: Eriksson et al.

A less well-known example occurs often when crowding agents are added to the buffer in order to mimic the environment commonly encountered in vivo. Crowding agents tested on different enzymes have been shown to have every conceivable effect on Km or Vmax , causing them to rise, fall, or stay the same. In this article, a mathematical analysis is presented allowing biochemists to judge whether an effector that causes Km and Vmax to both move in the same direction serves as an inhibitor, an activator, or most surprising, as both. © 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 47(4):446-449, 2019.","['1 Department of Chemistry, Willamette University, Salem, Oregon, 97301.']","Todd P Silverstein, ",Biochemistry and molecular biology education : a bimonthly publication of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,2019 Jul,"Audience; biochemistry, enzymes, kinetics; biochemistry; pedagogy; discrepant events; topics; upper division undergraduate; domain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30908872
848,Meeting Report - proteostasis in Ericeira,"It was a sunny Ericeira, in Portugal, that received the participants of the EMBO Workshop on Proteostasis, from 17 to 21 November 2017. Most participants gave talks or presented posters concerning their most recent research results, and lively scientific discussions occurred against the backdrop of the beautiful Atlantic Ocean.Proteostasis is the portmanteau of the words protein and homeostasis, and it refers to the biological mechanisms controlling the biogenesis, folding, trafficking and degradation of proteins in cells. An imbalance in proteostasis can lead to the accumulation of misfolded proteins or excessive protein degradation, and is associated with many human diseases. A wide variety of research approaches are used to identify the mechanisms that regulate proteostasis, typically involving different model organisms (yeast, invertebrates or mammalian systems) and different methodologies (genetics, biochemistry, biophysics, structural biology, cell biology and organismal biology). Around 140 researchers in the proteostasis field met in the Hotel Vila Galé, Ericeira, Portugal for the EMBO Workshop in Proteostasis, organized by Pedro Domingos (ITQB-NOVA, Oeiras, Portugal) and Colin Adrain (IGC, Oeiras, Portugal). In this report, we attempt to review and integrate the ideas that emerged at the workshop.

850,The multi-omics promise in context: from sequence to microbial isolate,"The numbers and diversity of microbes in ecosystems within and around us is unmatched, yet most of these microorganisms remain recalcitrant to in vitro cultivation. Various high-throughput molecular techniques, collectively termed multi-omics, provide insights into the genomic structure and metabolic potential as well as activity of complex microbial communities. Nonetheless, pure or defined cultures are needed to (1) decipher microbial physiology and thus test multi-omics-based ecological hypotheses, (2) curate and improve database annotations and (3) realize novel applications in biotechnology. Cultivation thus provides context. In turn, we here argue that multi-omics information awaits integration into the development of novel cultivation strategies. This can build the foundation for a new era of omics information-guided microbial cultivation technology and reduce the inherent trial-and-error search space. This review discusses how information that can be extracted from multi-omics data can be applied for the cultivation of hitherto uncultured microorganisms. Furthermore, we summarize groundbreaking studies that successfully translated information derived from multi-omics into specific media formulations, screening techniques and selective enrichments in order to obtain novel targeted microbial isolates. By integrating these examples, we conclude with a proposed workflow to facilitate future omics-aided cultivation strategies that are inspired by the microbial complexity of the environment.","['1 a Laboratory of Microbiology , Wageningen University & Research , Wageningen , The Netherlands.', '2 b Department of Microbial Ecology, Groningen Institute for Evolutionary Life Sciences (GELIFES) , Rijksuniversiteit Groningen , Groningen , The Netherlands.', '3 c Leibniz-Institut DSMZ-Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen , Braunschweig , Germany.']","Johanna Gutleben, Maryam Chaib De Mares, Jan Dirk van Elsas, Hauke Smidt, Jörg Overmann, Detmer Sipkema, ",Critical reviews in microbiology,2018 Mar,Bacterial cultivation; metagenomics; metatranscriptomics; multi-omics.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28562180
851,Sound localization by the internally coupled ears of lizards: From biophysics to biorobotics,"As they are generally small and only hear low frequencies, lizards have few cues for localizing sound. However, their ears show extreme directionality (up to 30 dB direction-dependent difference in eardrum vibrations) created by strong acoustical coupling of the eardrums, with almost perfect internal transmission from the contralateral ear over a broad frequency range. The activity of auditory nerve fibers reflects the eardrum directionality, so all auditory neurons are directional by default. This suggests that the ensuing neural processing of sound direction is simple in lizards. Even the simplest configuration of electrical analog models-two tympanic impedances connected via a central capacitor-produces directional patterns that are qualitatively similar to the experimental data on lizard ears. Several models, both analytical and (very recently) finite-element models, have been published. Robotic implementations using simplified models of the ear and of binaural comparison show that robust phonotaxic behavior can be generated with little additional processing and be performed by simple (and thus small and cheap) units. The authors review lizard directional processing and attempts at modeling and robotics with a twofold aim: to clarify the authors' understanding of central processing of sound localization in lizards, and to lead to technological developments of bioinspired robotics.","['1 Department of Biology, University of Southern Denmark, Campusvej 55, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark.', '2 Department for Neuroscience, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Carl von Ossietzky University, Carl von Ossietzky Strasse 9-11, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany.']","Jakob Christensen-Dalsgaard, Geoffrey A Manley, ",The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America,2019 Dec,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31893756
852,Estimating Multiscale Direct Causality Graphs in Neural Spike-Field Networks,"Neural representations span various spatiotemporal scales of brain activity, from the spiking activity of single neurons to field activity measuring large-scale networks. The simultaneous analyses of spikes and fields to uncover causal interactions in multiscale networks could help understand neural mechanisms. However, assessing causality within spike-field networks is challenging as spikes are binary-valued with a fast time-scale while fields are continuous-valued with slower time-scales. Current causality measures are largely not applicable to mixed discrete-continuous network activity. Here, in this paper, we develop a novel multiscale causality estimation algorithm for spike-field networks. We construct a likelihood function comprised of point process models for spikes and linear Gaussian models for fields. For spikes, firing rates are modeled as a function of the history of both field signals and binary spike events within the network. For fields, to make their linear models consistent with biophysical findings, we use the history of field signals and the history of the latent log-firing rates of neurons as predictors. To resolve the challenge of estimating the network model parameters in the presence of latent firing rates, we develop a sequential maximum-likelihood parameter estimation procedure that extends to large networks. Once models are estimated, we compute directed information as our measure of multiscale causality and devise two statistical tests to assess its significance. Using extensive simulations, we show that the algorithm can accurately reconstruct the true causality graphs of random spike-field networks. Moreover, the algorithm is robust to the number of connections, connection strengths, or exact topology of the network. This multiscale causality estimation algorithm has important implications for studying neural mechanisms and for future neurotechnology design.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Chuanmeizhi Wang, Maryam M Shanechi, ",IEEE transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,2019 May,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30932842

In some patients, however, cure of the arrhythmia is hampered by the complexity of the arrhythmia or the way the arrhythmia presents in the electrophysiological laboratory: some focal atrial and ventricular arrhythmias are difficult to induce using electrical stimulation or medical provocation. Precise mapping of these arrhythmias is challenging or even impossible by contact mapping, while other arrhythmias are poorly tolerated and need early termination.In these scenarios, use of non-contact mapping technology can be an alternative to conventional mapping, since isopotential maps may require no more than one ectopic beat identical with the clinical focal arrhythmia to reconstruct its endocardial origin.

However, the most modern machines and sophisticated tools for data analysis cannot compensate for inappropriate harvesting and/or sample preparation procedures that modify metabolic composition and can lead to erroneous interpretation of results. In addition, plant metabolism has a remarkable degree of complexity, and the number of identified compounds easily surpasses the number of samples in metabolomics analyses, increasing false discovery risk. These aspects pose a large challenge when carrying out plant metabolomics experiments.

However, planar cultured cells are different from the human 3D organs or tissues in vivo. To simulate the human 3D organs or tissues, 3D spheroids are developed by culturing a small aggregate of cells which reside around the extracellular matrix and interact with other cells in liquid media. Here we apply lung carcinoma cell lines to engineer the 3D lung cancer spheroid-based biosensor using the interdigitated electrodes for drug efficacy evaluation. The results show 3D spheroid had higher drug resistance than the planar cell model. The anticarcinogen inhibition on different 3D lung cancer spheroid models (A549, H1299, H460) can be quantitatively evaluated by electric impedance sensing. Besides, we delivered combination of anticarcinogens treatments to A549 spheroids which is commonly used in clinic treatment, and found the synergistic effect of cisplatin plus etoposide had higher drug response. To simultaneously test the drug efficacy and side effects on multi-organ model with circulatory system, a connected multiwell interdigitated electrode arraywas applied to culture different organoid spheroids. Overall, the organization of 3D cancer spheroids-based biosensor, which has higher predictive value for drug discovery and personalized medicine screening, is expected to be well applied in the area of pharmacy and clinical medicine.","['1 Biosensor National Special Laboratory, Key Laboratory of Biomedical Engineering of Ministry of Education, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310027, China.', '2 State Key Laboratory of Transducer Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 200050, China.', '3 Biosensor National Special Laboratory, Key Laboratory of Biomedical Engineering of Ministry of Education, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310027, China. huning@zju.edu.cn.', '4 State Key Laboratory of Transducer Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 200050, China. huning@zju.edu.cn.', '5 Biosensor National Special Laboratory, Key Laboratory of Biomedical Engineering of Ministry of Education, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310027, China. cnpwang@zju.edu.cn.', '6 State Key Laboratory of Transducer Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 200050, China. cnpwang@zju.edu.cn.']","Qian Wu, Xinwei Wei, Yuxiang Pan, Yingchang Zou, Ning Hu, Ping Wang, ",Biomedical microdevices,2018,3D cancer spheroid; Bionic 3D spheroid chips; Cancer model; Drug screening; Personalized medicine.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30220069

861,A computational model to investigate the influence of electrode lengths on the single probe bipolar radiofrequency ablation of the liver,"Background and objectives:
      
    

    
      Recently, there have been calls for RFA to be implemented in the bipolar mode for cancer treatment due to the benefits it offers over the monopolar mode. These include the ability to prevent skin burns at the grounding pad and to avoid tumour track seeding. The usage of bipolar RFA in clinical practice remains uncommon however, as not many research studies have been carried out on bipolar RFA. As such, there is still uncertainty in understanding the effects of the different RF probe configurations on the treatment outcome of RFA. This paper demonstrates that the electrode lengths have a strong influence on the mechanics of bipolar RFA. The information obtained here may lead to further optimization of the system for subsequent uses in the hospitals. Methods:
      
    

    
      A 2D model in the axisymmetric coordinates was developed to simulate the electro-thermophysiological responses of the tissue during a single probe bipolar RFA. Two different probe configurations were considered, namely the configuration where the active electrode is longer than the ground and the configuration where the ground electrode is longer than the active. The mathematical model was first verified with an existing experimental study found in the literature. Results:
      
    

    
      Results from the simulations showed that heating is confined only to the region around the shorter electrode, regardless of whether the shorter electrode is the active or the ground. Consequently, thermal coagulation also occurs in the region surrounding the shorter electrode. This opened up the possibility for a better customized treatment through the development of RF probes with adjustable electrode lengths. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The electrode length was found to play a significant role on the outcome of single probe bipolar RFA. In particular, the length of the shorter electrode becomes the limiting factor that influences the mechanics of single probe bipolar RFA. Results from this study can be used to further develop and optimize bipolar RFA as an effective and reliable cancer treatment technique.","['1 School of Engineering, Monash University Malaysia, Jalan Lagoon Selatan, Bandar Sunway 47500, Selangor, Malaysia.', '2 School of Engineering and Information Technology, Faculty of Science and Technology, Federation University, VIC 3350, Australia.', '3 School of Engineering, Monash University Malaysia, Jalan Lagoon Selatan, Bandar Sunway 47500, Selangor, Malaysia; Advanced Engineering Platform, Monash University Malaysia, Jalan Lagoon Selatan, Bandar Sunway 47500, Selangor, Malaysia.

Although identification of CSCs through specific marker expression helps define the CSC compartment, it does not directly provide information on how or why this cancer cell subpopulation is more metastatic or tumorigenic. In this study, the functional and biophysical characteristics of aggressive and lethal inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) CSCs at the single-cell level are comprehensively profiled using multiple microengineered tools. Distinct functional (cell migration, growth, adhesion, invasion and self-renewal) and biophysical (cell deformability, adhesion strength and contractility) properties of ALDH+ SUM149 IBC CSCs are found as compared to their ALDH- non-CSC counterpart, providing biophysical insights into why CSCs has an enhanced propensity to metastasize. It is further shown that the cellular biophysical phenotype can predict and determine IBC cells' tumorigenic ability. SUM149 and SUM159 IBC cells selected and modulated through biophysical attributes-adhesion and stiffness-show characteristics of CSCs in vitro and enhance tumorigenicity in in vivo murine models of primary tumor growth. Overall, the multiparametric cellular biophysical phenotyping and modulation of IBC CSCs yields a new understanding of IBC's metastatic properties and how they might develop and be targeted for therapeutic interventions.","['1 Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, New York University, Brooklyn, NY, 11201, USA.', '2 Department of Biomedical Engineering, New York University, Brooklyn, NY, 11201, USA.', '3 Program in Cellular and Molecular Biology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA.', '4 Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA.', '5 Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, 01003, USA.', '6 Undergraduate Program in Neuroscience, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA.', '7 Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA.', '8 Department of Biomedical Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', '9 Department of Biomedical Engineering, Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA.']","Weiqiang Chen, Steven G Allen, Weiyi Qian, Zifeng Peng, Shuo Han, Xiang Li, Yubing Sun, Chelsea Fournier, Liwei Bao, Raymond H W Lam, Sofia D Merajver, Jianping Fu, ","Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2019 Feb,biophysical property; cancer stem cells; inflammatory breast cancer.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30632269

872,Random forest-based imputation outperforms other methods for imputing LC-MS metabolomics data: a comparative study,"Background:
      
    

    
      LC-MS technology makes it possible to measure the relative abundance of numerous molecular features of a sample in single analysis. However, especially non-targeted metabolite profiling approaches generate vast arrays of data that are prone to aberrations such as missing values. No matter the reason for the missing values in the data, coherent and complete data matrix is always a pre-requisite for accurate and reliable statistical analysis. Therefore, there is a need for proper imputation strategies that account for the missingness and reduce the bias in the statistical analysis. Results:
      
    

    
      Here we present our results after evaluating nine imputation methods in four different percentages of missing values of different origin. The performance of each imputation method was analyzed by Normalized Root Mean Squared Error (NRMSE). We demonstrated that random forest (RF) had the lowest NRMSE in the estimation of missing values for Missing at Random (MAR) and Missing Completely at Random (MCAR). In case of absent values due to Missing Not at Random (MNAR), the left truncated data was best imputed with minimum value imputation. We also tested the different imputation methods for datasets containing missing data of various origin, and RF was the most accurate method in all cases. The results were obtained by repeating the evaluation process 100 times with the use of metabolomics datasets where the missing values were introduced to represent absent data of different origin. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Type and rate of missingness affects the performance and suitability of imputation methods. RF-based imputation method performs best in most of the tested scenarios, including combinations of different types and rates of missingness. Therefore, we recommend using random forest-based imputation for imputing missing metabolomics data, and especially in situations where the types of missingness are not known in advance.","['1 Institute of Public Health and Clinical Nutrition, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio Campus, P.O.

875,Can research align with service? Lessons learned from the Big Experiment and National Biomechanics Day,"Public engagement is an important role for the university academic, but is often neglected due to perceived lack of time and prioritized commitments in research and teaching. Yet, public engagement events offer an untapped opportunity for researchers to collect data from members of the general public who arrive on site at university labs. These engagement events could allow for data collection as part of didactic and demonstrative outreach events to be used in research and science. In this proof of concept study, a collaborative group of international researchers investigated the feasibility of embedding research quality assessment into events surrounding National Biomechanics Day. The Big Experiment collected data on 501 secondary school students (age range: 13 to 18 years) across 9 university sites within a 24-hour period. Data included maximal vertical jump height and self-reported physical activity levels. Vertical jump height was positively correlated to participant height, but not age or body mass. Very physically active students had significantly higher vertical jump heights than individuals who reported being somewhat or not physically active. This feasibility project demonstrates that with substantial preparation and a simple research design, focused research questions can be incorporated into educational outreach initiatives and ultimately provide a rich data source.","['1 School of Sport and Exercise, Massey University, New Zealand; Kinesiology Department, Seattle University, Seattle, WA, USA.

877,A framework for performance characterization of energy-resolving photon-counting detectors,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      Photon-counting, energy-resolving detectors are subject to intense research interest, and there is a need for a general framework for performance assessment of these detectors. The commonly used linear-systems theory framework, which measures detector performance in terms of noise-equivalent quanta (NEQ) and detective quantum efficiency (DQE) is widely used for characterizing conventional x-ray detectors but does not take energy-resolving capabilities into account. The purpose of this work is to extend this framework to encompass energy-resolving photon-counting detectors and elucidate how the imperfect energy response and other imperfections in real-world detectors affect imaging performance, both for feature detection and for material quantification tasks. Method:
      
    

    
      We generalize NEQ and DQE to matrix-valued quantities as functions of spatial frequency, and show how these matrices can be calculated from simple Monte Carlo simulations. To demonstrate how the new metrics can be interpreted, we compute them for simplified models of fluorescence and Compton scatter in a photon-counting detector and for a Monte Carlo model of a CdTe detector with 0.5  ×  0.5  mm 2   pixels. Results:
      
    

    
      Our results show that the ideal-linear-observer performance for any detection or material quantification task can be calculated from the proposed generalized NEQ and DQE metrics. We also demonstrate that the proposed NEQ metric is closely related to a generalized version of the Cramér-Rao lower bound commonly used for assessing material quantification performance. Off-diagonal elements in the NEQ and DQE matrices are shown to be related to loss of energy information due to imperfect energy resolution. The Monte Carlo model of the CdTe detector predicts a zero-frequency dose efficiency relative to an ideal detector of 0.86 and 0.65 for detecting water and bone, respectively. When the task instead is to quantify these materials, the corresponding values are 0.34 for water and 0.26 for bone. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We have developed a framework for assessing the performance of photon-counting energy-resolving detectors and shown that the matrix-valued NEQ and DQE metrics contain sufficient information for calculating the dose efficiency for both detection and quantification tasks, the task having any spatial and energy dependence. This framework will be beneficial for the development and optimization of photon-counting x-ray detectors.","['1 Departments of Bioengineering and Radiology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA.', '2 Departments of Electrical Engineering and Radiology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA.', '3 Departments of Bioengineering, Radiology and Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA.']","Mats Persson, Paurakh L Rajbhandary, Norbert J Pelc, ",Medical physics,2018 Nov,Cramér-Rao lower bound; detective quantum efficiency; linear-systems theory; noise-equivalent quanta; photon counting; spectral imaging; x-ray imaging.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30191571
878,"Micron resolution, high-fidelity three-dimensional vascular optical imaging phantoms","Microscopic and mesoscale optical imaging techniques allow for three-dimensional (3-D) imaging of biological tissue across millimeter-scale regions, and imaging phantom models are invaluable for system characterization and clinical training. Phantom models that replicate complex 3-D geometries with both structural and molecular contrast, with resolution and lateral dimensions equivalent to those of imaging techniques (<20 μm), have proven elusive. We present a method for fabricating phantom models using a combination of two-photon polymerization (2PP) to print scaffolds, and microinjection of tailored tissue-mimicking materials to simulate healthy and diseased tissue. We provide a first demonstration of the capabilities of this method with intravascular optical coherence tomography, an imaging technique widely used in clinical practice. We describe the design, fabrication, and validation of three types of phantom models: a first with subresolution wires (5- to 34-μm diameter) arranged circumferentially, a second with a vessel side-branch, and a third containing a lipid inclusion within a vessel. Silicone hybrid materials and lipids, microinjected within a resin framework created with 2PP, served as tissue-mimicking materials that provided realistic optical scattering and absorption. We demonstrate that optical phantom models made with 2PP and microinjected tissue-mimicking materials can simulate complex anatomy and pathology with exquisite detail.","['1 Wellcome Trust-EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences, London, United Kingdom.', '2 Royal Free Hospital, Department of Cardiology, London, United Kingdom.', '3 University College London, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Photonic Innovations, United Kingdom.', '4 University College London, Department of Medical Physics and Bioengineering, London, United Kingdom.', '5 University College London, Nanoengineered Systems Laboratory, UCL Mechanical Engineering, London, United Kingdom.']","Callum D Little, Radhika K Poduval, Richard Caulfield, Sacha Noimark, Richard J Colchester, Chris D Loder, Manish K Tiwari, Roby D Rakhit, Ioannis Papakonstantinou, Adrien E Desjardins, ",Journal of biomedical optics,2019 Feb,imaging phantoms; optical coherence tomography; optics; tissue-mimicking materials; two-photon polymerization; vascular.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30770678
879,"Characterization of the human ridged and non-ridged skin: a comprehensive histological, histochemical and immunohistochemical analysis","The structure of the human skin is directly dependent on its location and the mechanical forces to which it is subjected. In the present work, we have performed a comprehensive analysis of the human ridged and non-ridged skin to identify the differences and similarities between both skin types. For this purpose, human skin samples were obtained from dorsal hand skin (DHS), palmar hand skin (PHS), dorsal foot skin (DFS) and plantar foot skin (PFS) from the same cadaveric donors. Histological, histochemical and semiquantitative and quantitative immunohistochemical analyses were carried out to evaluate the epidermis, dermis and basement membrane. Results show that the epithelial layer of ridged skin had larger cell number and size than non-ridged skin for most strata. Melanocytes and Langerhans cells were more abundant in non-ridged skin, whereas Merkel cells were preferentially found in ridged skin. The expression pattern of CK5/6 was slightly differed between non-ridged and ridged skin. Involucrin expression was slightly more intense in non-ridged skin than in ridged skin. Collagen was more abundant in foot skin dermis than in hand skin, and in ridged skin as compared to non-ridged skin. Elastic fibers were more abundant in DHS. Biglycan was more abundant in foot skin than in hand skin. No differences were found for blood and lymphatic vessels. The basement membrane laminin was preferentially found in foot skin. These results revealed important differences at the epithelial, dermal and basement membrane levels that could contribute to a better knowledge of the human skin histology.","['1 Tissue Engineering Group, Department of Histology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Granada, Avenida de la Investigación 11, Torre A, Planta 5, 18016, Granada, Spain.', '2 PhD Program in Biomedicine, Escuela de Posgrado, University of Granada, Granada, Spain.', '3 Instituto de Investigación Biosanitaria ibs.GRANADA, Granada, Spain.', '4 Department of Pathology, San Cecilio University Hospital, Granada, Spain.', '5 Orthopedic Surgery Department, Virgen de las Nieves University Hospital, Granada, Spain.', '6 Department of Surgery, University of Granada, Granada, Spain.', '7 Tissue Engineering Group, Department of Histology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Granada, Avenida de la Investigación 11, Torre A, Planta 5, 18016, Granada, Spain. malaminos@ugr.es.', '8 Instituto de Investigación Biosanitaria ibs.GRANADA, Granada, Spain. malaminos@ugr.es.']","A Vela-Romera, V Carriel, M A Martín-Piedra, J Aneiros-Fernández, F Campos, J Chato-Astrain, N Prados-Olleta, A Campos, M Alaminos, I Garzón, ",Histochemistry and cell biology,2019 Jan,Glabrous skin; Histochemistry; Histology; Immunohistochemistry; Non-ridged skin; Palmoplantar skin; Quantitative analysis; Ridged skin; Skin.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30099600
880,Experimentally-constrained biophysical models of tonic and burst firing modes in thalamocortical neurons,"Somatosensory thalamocortical (TC) neurons from the ventrobasal (VB) thalamus are central components in the flow of sensory information between the periphery and the cerebral cortex, and participate in the dynamic regulation of thalamocortical states including wakefulness and sleep. This property is reflected at the cellular level by the ability to generate action potentials in two distinct firing modes, called tonic firing and low-threshold bursting. Although the general properties of TC neurons are known, we still lack a detailed characterization of their morphological and electrical properties in the VB thalamus. The aim of this study was to build biophysically-detailed models of VB TC neurons explicitly constrained with experimental data from rats. We recorded the electrical activity of VB neurons (N = 49) and reconstructed morphologies in 3D (N = 50) by applying standardized protocols. After identifying distinct electrical types, we used a multi-objective optimization to fit single neuron electrical models (e-models), which yielded multiple solutions consistent with the experimental data. The models were tested for generalization using electrical stimuli and neuron morphologies not used during fitting. A local sensitivity analysis revealed that the e-models are robust to small parameter changes and that all the parameters were constrained by one or more features. The e-models, when tested in combination with different morphologies, showed that the electrical behavior is substantially preserved when changing dendritic structure and that the e-models were not overfit to a specific morphology. The models and their analysis show that automatic parameter search can be applied to capture complex firing behavior, such as co-existence of tonic firing and low-threshold bursting over a wide range of parameter sets and in combination with different neuron morphologies.","['1 Blue Brain Project, École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) Biotech Campus, Geneva, Switzerland.', '2 Laboratory of Neural Microcircuitry, Brain Mind Institute, École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland.', '3 Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), Toronto, Canada.']","Elisabetta Iavarone, Jane Yi, Ying Shi, Bas-Jan Zandt, Christian O'Reilly, Werner Van Geit, Christian Rössert, Henry Markram, Sean L Hill, ",PLoS computational biology,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31095552
881,Advances in metabolome information retrieval: turning chemistry into biology. Part I: analytical chemistry of the metabolome,"Metabolites are small molecules produced by enzymatic reactions in a given organism. Metabolomics or metabolic phenotyping is a well-established omics aimed at comprehensively assessing metabolites in biological systems. These comprehensive analyses use analytical platforms, mainly nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, along with associated separation methods to gather qualitative and quantitative data. Metabolomics holistically evaluates biological systems in an unbiased, data-driven approach that may ultimately support generation of hypotheses. The approach inherently allows the molecular characterization of a biological sample with regard to both internal (genetics) and environmental (exosome, microbiome) influences. Metabolomics workflows are based on whether the investigator knows a priori what kind of metabolites to assess. Thus, a targeted metabolomics approach is defined as a quantitative analysis (absolute concentrations are determined) or a semiquantitative analysis (relative intensities are determined) of a set of metabolites that are possibly linked to common chemical classes or a selected metabolic pathway. An untargeted metabolomics approach is a semiquantitative analysis of the largest possible number of metabolites contained in a biological sample. This is part I of a review intending to give an overview of the state of the art of major metabolic phenotyping technologies.

883,Epigenetic Optical Mapping of 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine in Nanochannel Arrays,"The epigenetic mark 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) is a distinct product of active DNA demethylation that is linked to gene regulation, development, and disease. In particular, 5-hmC levels dramatically decline in many cancers, potentially serving as an epigenetic biomarker. The noise associated with next-generation 5-hmC sequencing hinders reliable analysis of low 5-hmC containing tissues such as blood and malignant tumors. Additionally, genome-wide 5-hmC profiles generated by short-read sequencing are limited in providing long-range epigenetic information relevant to highly variable genomic regions, such as the 3.7 Mbp disease-related Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) region. We present a long-read, highly sensitive single-molecule mapping technology that generates hybrid genetic/epigenetic profiles of native chromosomal DNA. The genome-wide distribution of 5-hmC in human peripheral blood cells correlates well with 5-hmC DNA immunoprecipitation (hMeDIP) sequencing. However, the long single-molecule read-length of 100 kbp to 1 Mbp produces 5-hmC profiles across variable genomic regions that failed to show up in the sequencing data. In addition, optical 5-hmC mapping shows a strong correlation between the 5-hmC density in gene bodies and the corresponding level of gene expression. The single-molecule concept provides information on the distribution and coexistence of 5-hmC signals at multiple genomic loci on the same genomic DNA molecule, revealing long-range correlations and cell-to-cell epigenetic variation.","['1 School of Chemistry, Center for Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, Center for Light-Matter Interaction, Raymond and Beverly Sackler Faculty of Exact Sciences , Tel Aviv University , Tel Aviv , Israel.', '2 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology , Meir Hospital , Kfar Saba , Israel.', '3 Sackler Faculty of Medicine , Tel Aviv University , Tel Aviv , Israel.']","Tslil Gabrieli, Hila Sharim, Gil Nifker, Jonathan Jeffet, Tamar Shahal, Rani Arielly, Michal Levi-Sakin, Lily Hoch, Nissim Arbib, Yael Michaeli, Yuval Ebenstein, ",ACS nano,2018,5-hydroxymethylcytosine; epigenetics; fluorescence microscopy; methylation; nanochannels; nanotechnology; optical mapping; single-molecule.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29924591

The VSP gene is conserved from unicellular organisms to higher vertebrates. Membrane depolarization induces electrical driven conformational rearrangement in the VSD, which is translated into catalytic enzyme activity. Biophysical and structural characterization has revealed details of the mechanisms underlying the molecular functions of VSP. Coupling between the VSD and the enzyme is tight, such that enzyme activity is tuned in a graded fashion to the membrane voltage. Upon VSP activation, multiple species of phosphoinositides are simultaneously altered, and the profile of enzyme activity depends on the history of the membrane potential. VSPs have been the obvious candidate link between membrane potential and phosphoinositide regulation. However, patterns of voltage change regulating VSP in native cells remain largely unknown. This review addresses the current understanding of the biophysical biochemical properties of VSP and provides new insight into the proposed functions of VSP.","['1 Department of Physiology, Laboratory of Integrative Physiology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka University , Osaka , Japan ; and Graduate School of Frontier Biosciences, Osaka University , Osaka , Japan.']","Yasushi Okamura, Akira Kawanabe, Takafumi Kawai, ",Physiological reviews,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30067160

In digestive system, myoelectrical activity is recorded from the abdominal surface. Frequency and power of Gastrointestinal (GI) activity is usually assessed using power spectral analysis. However, spectral analysis of GI electrical activity is a nonspecific test, failing to distinguish diseases. Other dimensions of GI electrical waves may help identify diseases more precisely. Studying complex systems is one of the approaches that can be taken for research on body systems. The dynamic variability of a complex system is estimated by nonlinear methods. Previous studies have identified how functional dynamic variability of organs differ in normal and disease conditions. Variation of electroencephalogram, heart rate, and respiratory rate are known examples of system dynamic fluctuation. If we consider the digestive tract as a complex system, the dynamic variation of the waves in the GI system could be analyzed by nonlinear methods to possibly help clinicians assess various conditions of the GI system in healthy subjects and patients.","['1 Department of Physiology-Pharmacology-Medical Physics, Faculty of Medicine, Alborz University of Medical Sciences, Karaj, Alborz, Iran.

887,Biomechanical mechanism of lateral trunk lean gait for knee osteoarthritis patients,"The biomechanical mechanism of lateral trunk lean gait employed to reduce external knee adduction moment (KAM) for knee osteoarthritis (OA) patients is not well known. This mechanism may relate to the center of mass (COM) motion. Moreover, lateral trunk lean gait may affect motor control of the COM displacement. Uncontrolled manifold (UCM) analysis is an evaluation index used to understand motor control and variability of the motor task. Here we aimed to clarify the biomechanical mechanism to reduce KAM during lateral trunk lean gait and how motor variability controls the COM displacement. Twenty knee OA patients walked under two conditions: normal and lateral trunk lean gait conditions. UCM analysis was performed with respect to the COM displacement in the frontal plane. We also determined how the variability is structured with regards to the COM displacement as a performance variable. The peak KAM under lateral trunk lean gait was lower than that under normal gait. The reduced peak KAM observed was accompanied by medially shifted knee joint center, shortened distance of the center of pressure to knee joint center, and shortened distance of the knee-ground reaction force lever arm during the stance phase. Knee OA patients with lateral trunk lean gait could maintain kinematic synergy by utilizing greater segmental configuration variance to the performance variable. However, the COM displacement variability of lateral trunk lean gait was larger than that of normal gait.

888,Metabolomic and glycomic findings in posttraumatic stress disorder,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a stressor-related disorder that develops in a subset of individuals exposed to a traumatic experience. Factors associated with vulnerability to PTSD are still not fully understood. PTSD is frequently comorbid with various psychiatric and somatic disorders, moderate response to treatment and remission rates. The term ""theranostics"" combines diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy and offers targeted therapy based on specific analyses. Theranostics, combined with novel techniques and approaches called ""omics"", which integrate genomics, transcriptomic, proteomics and metabolomics, might improve knowledge about biological underpinning of PTSD, and offer novel therapeutic strategies. The focus of this review is on metabolomic and glycomic data in PTSD. Metabolomics evaluates changes in the metabolome of an organism by exploring the set of small molecules (metabolites), while glycomics studies the glycome, a complete repertoire of glycan structures with their functional roles in biological systems. Both metabolome and glycome reflect the physiological and pathological conditions in individuals. Only a few studies evaluated metabolic and glycomic changes in patients with PTSD. The metabolomics studies in PTSD patients uncovered different metabolites that might be associated with psychopathological alterations in PTSD. The glycomics study in PTSD patients determined nine N-glycan structures and found accelerated and premature aging in traumatized subjects and subjects with PTSD based on a GlycoAge index. Therefore, further larger studies and replications are needed. Better understanding of the biological basis of PTSD, including metabolomic and glycomic data, and their integration with other ""omics"" approaches, might identify new molecular targets and might provide improved therapeutic approaches.","['1 Rudjer Boskovic Institute, Division of Molecular Medicine, Bijenicka cesta 54, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia.', '2 Rudjer Boskovic Institute, Division of Molecular Medicine, Bijenicka cesta 54, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia; The Centre of Metabolomics and Bioanalysis (CEMBIO), University San Pablo CEU, Urbanización Montepríncipe, 28660 Boadilla del Monte, Madrid, Spain.', '3 The Centre of Metabolomics and Bioanalysis (CEMBIO), University San Pablo CEU, Urbanización Montepríncipe, 28660 Boadilla del Monte, Madrid, Spain.', '4 Clinic for Psychiatry Vrapce, Bolnicka cesta 32, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia; University Josip Juraj Strossmayer Osijek, School of Medicine, Trg Svetog Trojstva 3, 31000 Osijek, Croatia.', '5 GENOS, Glycoscience Research Laboratory, Borongajska cesta 83, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia.', '6 Rudjer Boskovic Institute, Division of Molecular Medicine, Bijenicka cesta 54, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia.

889,High-speed mechano-active multielectrode array for investigating rapid stretch effects on cardiac tissue,"Systematic investigations of the effects of mechano-electric coupling (MEC) on cellular cardiac electrophysiology lack experimental systems suitable to subject tissues to in-vivo like strain patterns while simultaneously reporting changes in electrical activation. Here, we describe a self-contained motor-less device (mechano-active multielectrode-array, MaMEA) that permits the assessment of impulse conduction along bioengineered strands of cardiac tissue in response to dynamic strain cycles. The device is based on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) cell culture substrates patterned with dielectric actuators (DEAs) and compliant gold ion-implanted extracellular electrodes. The DEAs induce uniaxial stretch and compression in defined regions of the PDMS substrate at selectable amplitudes and with rates up to 18 s-1. Conduction along cardiomyocyte strands was found to depend linearly on static strain according to cable theory while, unexpectedly, being completely independent on strain rates. Parallel operation of multiple MaMEAs provides for systematic high-throughput investigations of MEC during spatially patterned mechanical perturbations mimicking in-vivo conditions.","['1 Soft Transducers Laboratory, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), 2002, Neuchâtel, Switzerland. mimboden@bu.edu.', '2 Department of Physiology, University of Bern, Bühlplatz 5, 3012, Bern, Switzerland. mimboden@bu.edu.', '3 Department of Physiology, University of Bern, Bühlplatz 5, 3012, Bern, Switzerland.', '4 Soft Transducers Laboratory, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), 2002, Neuchâtel, Switzerland.', '5 Department of Physiology, University of Bern, Bühlplatz 5, 3012, Bern, Switzerland. rohr@pyl.unibe.ch.']","Matthias Imboden, Etienne de Coulon, Alexandre Poulin, Christian Dellenbach, Samuel Rosset, Herbert Shea, Stephan Rohr, ",Nature communications,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30783104
890,Understanding and exploiting the roles of autophagy in plants through multi-omics approaches,"Autophagy is a highly conserved pathway in eukaryotes that promotes nutrient recycling and cellular homeostasis through the degradation of excess or damaged cytoplasmic constituents. In plants, autophagy is increasingly recognized as a key contributor to development, reproduction, metabolism, leaf senescence, endosperm and grain development, pathogen defense, and tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses. Characterizing the functional transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic networks relating to autophagy in plants subjected to various extra- and intra-cellular stimuli may help to identify components associated with the pathway. As such, the integration of multi-omics approaches (i.e., transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics), along with cellular, genetic and functional analyses, could provide a global perspective regarding the effects of autophagy on plant metabolism, development and stress responses. In this mini-review, recent research progress in plant autophagy is discussed, highlighting the importance of high-throughput omics approaches for defining the underpinning molecular mechanisms of autophagy and understanding its associated regulatory network.","['1 Key Laboratory of South China Agricultural Plant Molecular Analysis and Genetic Improvement, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Applied Botany, South China Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510650, China; Department of Biology, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO 63130, USA; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.', '2 Department of Biology, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO 63130, USA.', '3 College of Life Sciences, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China.

891,Dendritic sodium spikes endow neurons with inverse firing rate response to correlated synaptic activity,"Many neurons possess dendrites enriched with sodium channels and are capable of generating action potentials. However, the role of dendritic sodium spikes remain unclear. Here, we study computational models of neurons to investigate the functional effects of dendritic spikes. In agreement with previous studies, we found that point neurons or neurons with passive dendrites increase their somatic firing rate in response to the correlation of synaptic bombardment for a wide range of input conditions, i.e. input firing rates, synaptic conductances, or refractory periods. However, neurons with active dendrites show the opposite behavior: for a wide range of conditions the firing rate decreases as a function of correlation. We found this property in three types of models of dendritic excitability: a Hodgkin-Huxley model of dendritic spikes, a model with integrate and fire dendrites, and a discrete-state dendritic model. We conclude that fast dendritic spikes confer much broader computational properties to neurons, sometimes opposite to that of point neurons.","['1 Unité de Neurosciences, Information et Complexité, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Gif-sur-Yvette, France. gorski@inaf.cnrs-gif.fr.', '2 European Institute for Theoretical Neuroscience, Paris, France. gorski@inaf.cnrs-gif.fr.', '3 Inria, Sophia Antipolis, France.', '4 Unité de Neurosciences, Information et Complexité, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Gif-sur-Yvette, France.', '5 European Institute for Theoretical Neuroscience, Paris, France.']","Tomasz Górski, Romain Veltz, Mathieu Galtier, Hélissande Fragnaud, Jennifer S Goldman, Bartosz Teleńczuk, Alain Destexhe, ",Journal of computational neuroscience,2018 Dec,Dendritic integration; Synaptic input correlations.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30547292
892,Branching morphology and biomechanics of ivy (Hedera helix) stem-branch attachments,"Premise:
      
    

    
      Hedera helix is a striking example of a plant with morphological traits and growth habits that vary between juvenile and adult phases. The present study focuses on its branching morphology and variations with age and change in growth habit, based on conspicuous stem-branch attachments previously described in related Araliaceae species. Methods:
      
    

    
      We decorticated and morphologically analyzed 300 samples of ramifications from prostrate, climbing and self-supporting axes of H. helix. For bending experiments, 103 specimens with the self-supporting growth habit were collected. Results:
      
    

    
      Ramifications of H. helix exhibited a so-called ""finger-like"" branching morphology with abaxial branch lobes and varying degrees of fusion of woody strands. Three categories of woody strand coalescence were defined. Biomechanical experiments in which the branches of stem-branch attachments were bent revealed two main modes of failure, breaking failure in (1) the attachment region and (2) the side branch. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Coalescence of woody strands in H. helix ramifications results from accumulation of secondary xylem with age, influenced by mechanical stimuli causing specific loading situations during different growth habits. Mechanical experiments showed the tendency toward failure in the side branch with increasing fusion of woody strands, affected by the diameter ratio of the side branch to the main axis. Of specific interest is the comparison of H. helix branching with tropical Araliaceae, which do not show the described coalescence of woody strands to this extent. Fracture toughness of self-supporting H. helix axes with merged stem-branch attachment regions are comparable to other self-supporting plant species, despite anatomical and ontogenetic differences.","['1 Plant Biomechanics Group & Botanic Garden, University of Freiburg, Schänzlestr. 1, 79104, Freiburg/Breisgau, Germany.', '2 Freiburg Center for Interactive Materials and Bioinspired Technologies, University of Freiburg, Georges-Köhler-Allee 105, 79110, Freiburg/Breisgau, Germany.']","Katharina Bunk, Semjon Krassovitski, Thomas Speck, Tom Masselter, ",American journal of botany,2019 Sep,Araliaceae; biomechanics; branching; fracture toughness; ivy (Hedera helix); stem-branch attachment.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31449336
893,The biomechanical role of overall-shape transformation in a primitive multicellular organism: A case study of dimorphism in the filamentous cyanobacterium Arthrospira platensis,"Morphological transformations in primitive organisms have long been observed; however, its biomechanical roles are largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate the structural advantages of dimorphism in Arthrospira platensis, a filamentous multicellular cyanobacterium. We report that helical trichomes, the default shape, have a higher persistence length (Lp), indicating a higher resistance to bending or a large value of flexural rigidity (kf), the product of the local cell stiffness (E) and the moment of inertia of the trichomes' cross-section (I). Through Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), we determined that the E of straight and helical trichomes were the same. In contrast, our computational model shows that I is greatly dependent on helical radii, implying that trichome morphology is the major contributor to kf variation. According to our estimation, increasing the helical radii alone can increase kf by 2 orders of magnitude. We also observe that straight trichomes have improved gliding ability, due to its structure and lower kf. Our study shows that dimorphism provides mechanical adjustability to the organism and may allow it to thrive in different environmental conditions. The higher kf provides helical trichomes a better nutrient uptake through advection in aquatic environments. On the other hand, the lower kf improves the gliding ability of straight trichomes in aquatic environments, enabling it to chemotactically relocate to more favorable territories when it encounters certain environmental stresses. When more optimal conditions are encountered, straight trichomes can revert to their original helical form. Our study is one of the first to highlight the biomechanical role of an overall-shape transformation in cyanobacteria.","[""1 Biological Engineering Program, Faculty of Engineering, King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi, Bangkok, Thailand."", ""2 Division of Biotechnology, School of Bioresources and Technology, King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi, Bangkok, Thailand."", '3 Centre for Cell Engineering, Institute of Molecular, Cell and Systems Biology, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', '4 The Synchrotron Light Research Institute, Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand.', ""5 Nanoscience & Nanotechnology Graduate Program, Faculty of Science, King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi, Bangkok, Thailand."", '6 School of Physics, Institute of Science, Suranaree University of Technology, Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand.', '7 School of Biotechnology, Institute of Agricultural Technology, Suranaree University of Technology, Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand.']","Atitheb Chaiyasitdhi, Wirat Miphonpanyatawichok, Mathis Oliver Riehle, Rungrueang Phatthanakun, Werasak Surareungchai, Worasom Kundhikanjana, Panwong Kuntanawat, ",PloS one,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29746494
894,Biophysical Principles of Ion-Channel-Mediated Mechanosensory Transduction,"Recent rapid progress in the field of mechanobiology has been driven by novel emerging tools and methodologies and growing interest from different scientific disciplines. Specific progress has been made toward understanding how cell mechanics is linked to intracellular signaling and the regulation of gene expression in response to a variety of mechanical stimuli. There is a direct link between the mechanoreceptors at the cell surface and intracellular biochemical signaling, which in turn controls downstream effector molecules. Among the mechanoreceptors in the cell membrane, mechanosensitive (MS) ion channels are essential for the ultra-rapid (millisecond) transduction of mechanical stimuli into biologically relevant signals. The three decades of research on mechanosensitive channels resulted in the formulation of two basic principles of mechanosensitive channel gating: force-from-lipids and force-from-filament. In this review, we revisit the biophysical principles that underlie the innate force-sensing ability of mechanosensitive channels as contributors to the force-dependent evolution of life forms.","[""1 Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute, Lowy Packer Building, Darlinghurst, NSW 2010, Australia; St. Vincent's Clinical School, University of New South Wales, Darlinghurst, NSW 2010, Australia."", '2 Institute for Biophysical Dynamics, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', ""3 Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute, Lowy Packer Building, Darlinghurst, NSW 2010, Australia; St. Vincent's Clinical School, University of New South Wales, Darlinghurst, NSW 2010, Australia.

      Stimulation parameters in deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus for Parkinson's disease (PD) are rarely tested in double-blind conditions. Evidence-based recommendations on optimal stimulator settings are needed. Results from the CUSTOM-DBS study are reported, comparing 2 pulse durations. Methods:
      
    

    
      A total of 15 patients were programmed using a pulse width of 30 µs (test) or 60 µs (control). Efficacy and side-effect thresholds and unified PD rating scale (UPDRS) III were measured in meds-off (primary outcome). The therapeutic window was the difference between patients' efficacy and side effect thresholds. Results:
      
    

    
      The therapeutic window was significantly larger at 30 µs than 60 µs (P = ·0009) and the efficacy (UPDRS III score) was noninferior (P = .00008). Interpretation:
      
    

    
      Subthalamic neurostimulation at 30 µs versus 60 µs pulse width is equally effective on PD motor signs, is more energy efficient, and has less likelihood of stimulation-related side effects. © 2017 The Authors.

898,Collective intercellular communication through ultra-fast hydrodynamic trigger waves,"The biophysical relationships between sensors and actuators1-5 have been fundamental to the development of complex life forms. Swimming organisms generate abundant flows that persist in aquatic environments6-13, and responding promptly to external stimuli is key to survival14-19. Here we present the discovery of 'hydrodynamic trigger waves' in cellular communities of the protist Spirostomum ambiguum that propagate-in a manner similar to a chain reaction20-22-hundreds of times faster than their swimming speed. By coiling its cytoskeleton, Spirostomum can contract its long body by 60% within milliseconds23, experiencing accelerations that can reach forces of 14g. We show that a single cellular contraction (the transmitter) generates long-ranged vortex flows at intermediate Reynolds numbers that can, in turn, trigger neighbouring cells (the receivers). To measure the sensitivity to hydrodynamic signals in these receiver cells, we present a high-throughput suction-flow device for probing mechanosensitive ion channels24 by back-calculating the microscopic forces on the cell membrane. We analyse and quantitatively model the ultra-fast hydrodynamic trigger waves in a universal framework of antenna and percolation theory25,26, and reveal a phase transition that requires a critical colony density to sustain collective communication. Our results suggest that this signalling could help to organize cohabiting communities over large distances and influence long-term behaviour through gene expression (comparable to quorum sensing16). In more immediate terms, because contractions release toxins27, synchronized discharges could facilitate the repulsion of large predators or immobilize large prey. We postulate that numerous aquatic organisms other than protists could coordinate their behaviour using variations of hydrodynamic trigger waves.","['1 Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', '2 School of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA.', '3 School of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA. saadb@chbe.gatech.edu.', '4 Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. manup@stanford.edu.']","Arnold J T M Mathijssen, Joshua Culver, M Saad Bhamla, Manu Prakash, ",Nature,2019 Jul,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31292551

We investigated concurrent validity of head tracking of two Head Mounted Displays (HMDs), Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, vs. a gold-standard motion capture system (Qualisys). Head kinematics of N = 20 healthy young adults was quantified during static and dynamic postural tasks. While wearing the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive, participants observed moving stars (static tasks) or a flying ball (dynamic task). Head kinematics were recorded simultaneously by the Rift or Vive and Qualisys camera system. We calculated head directional path, acceleration in 6 directions and volume of translation movement. Intra-Class Correlations (ICC) and 95% Limits of agreement were calculated. Most ICC values were around 0.9 with several at 0.99 indicating excellent agreement between the HMDs and Qualisys. Weaker agreement was observed for vertical displacement during a static task and moderate agreement was observed pitch and yaw displacement during a dynamic task. A negative bias of a small magnitude (indicating more movement in VR) was observed for most variables in static tasks, while a positive bias was observed for most variables in the dynamic task (indicating less movement in VR). Our results generally support the concurrent validity of Oculus Rift and HTC Vive head tracking during static and dynamic standing tasks in healthy young adults. Specific task- and direction-dependent differences should be considered when planning measurement studies using these novel tools.","['1 New York University, Department of Physical Therapy, Steinhardt School of Culture Education and Human Development, United States.

In this study, an integrated metabonomic-proteomic method was performed to systematically compare the profiles of metabolites and proteins with or without ciprofloxacin (CFLX) treatment. Proteomics identified 290 altered proteins including 143 with decreased and 147 increased expression, respectively. Metabonomics identified 65 altered metabolites including 58 and 7 with decreased and increased expression, respectively. The integrated analysis showed that the CFLX inhibited the DNA replication and increased the expression of DNA gyrase and DNA topoisomerase 1, while causing a sharp decrease in metabolic activity such as the alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism. Moreover, CFLX affected the biosynthesis of aminoacyl- transfer RNAs (tRNAs), leading to an increase in aminoacyl-tRNAs ligases, but limited the aminoacyl-tRNAs-mediated-biosynthesis of related amino acids. In this study, we identified the metabolite and protein profiles under CFLX stress, indicating the mode of action of antibiotics in E. coli.

907,The Impact of Electrical Charge Delivery on Inhibition of Mechanical Hypersensitivity in Nerve-Injured Rats by Sub-Sensory Threshold Spinal Cord Stimulation,"Objectives:
      
    

    
      Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) represents an important neurostimulation therapy for pain. A new ultra-high frequency (10,000 Hz) SCS paradigm has shown improved pain relief without eliciting paresthesia. We aim to determine whether sub-sensory threshold SCS of lower frequencies also can inhibit mechanical hypersensitivity in nerve-injured rats and examine how electric charge delivery of stimulation may affect pain inhibition by different patterns of subthreshold SCS. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      We used a custom-made quadripolar electrode (Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) to provide bipolar SCS epidurally at the T10 to T12 vertebral level. According to previous findings, SCS was tested at 40% of the motor threshold, which is considered to be a sub-sensory threshold intensity in rats. Paw withdrawal thresholds to punctate mechanical stimulation were measured before and after SCS in rats that received an L5 spinal nerve ligation. Results:
      
    

    
      Both 10,000 Hz (10 kHz, 0.024 msec) and lower frequencies (200 Hz, 1 msec; 500 Hz, 0.5 msec; 1200 Hz; 0.2 msec) of subthreshold SCS (120 min) attenuated mechanical hypersensitivity, as indicated by increased paw withdrawal thresholds after stimulation in spinal nerve ligation rats. Pain inhibition from different patterns of subthreshold SCS was not governed by individual stimulation parameters. However, correlation analysis suggests that pain inhibition from 10 kHz subthreshold SCS in individual animals was positively correlated with the electric charges delivered per second (electrical dose). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Inhibition of neuropathic mechanical hypersensitivity can be achieved with low-frequency subthreshold SCS by optimizing the electric charge delivery, which may affect the effect of SCS in individual animals.","['1 Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', '2 Department of Neurobiology, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', ""3 Department of Orthopedics, Hong Hui Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Medical School, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shanxi, China."", '4 Department of Orthopedics, Luhe Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', '5 Department of Biomedical Engineering, Institute for Computational Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.', '6 Core Technology & Research, Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA.', '7 Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', '8 Department of Neurological Surgery, Johns Hopkins University, School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.']","Zhiyong Chen, Qian Huang, Fei Yang, Christine Shi, Eellan Sivanesan, Shuguang Liu, Xueming Chen, Sridevi V Sarma, Louis P Vera-Portocarrero, Bengt Linderoth, Srinivasa N Raja, Yun Guan, ",Neuromodulation : journal of the International Neuromodulation Society,2019 Feb,Electrical charge; nerve injury; pain; rat; spinal cord stimulation.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30556616
908,Platelet Mechanotransduction,"The vasculature is a dynamic environment in which blood platelets constantly survey the endothelium for sites of vessel damage. The formation of a mechanically coherent hemostatic plug to prevent blood loss relies on a coordinated series of ligand-receptor interactions governing the recruitment, activation, and aggregation of platelets. The physical biology of each step is distinct in that the recruitment of platelets depends on the mechanosensing of the platelet receptor glycoprotein Ib for the adhesive protein von Willebrand factor, whereas platelet activation and aggregation are responsive to the mechanical forces sensed at adhesive junctions between platelets and at the platelet-matrix interface. Herein we take a biophysical perspective to discuss the current understanding of platelet mechanotransduction as well as the measurement techniques used to quantify the physical biology of platelets in the context of thrombus formation under flow.","[""1 Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Department of Pediatrics, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta/Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30332, USA; email: wilbur.lam@emory.edu."", '2 Wallace H.

909,Gain-of-function HCN2 variants in genetic epilepsy,"Genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE) is a common epilepsy syndrome that encompasses seizure disorders characterized by spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs). Pacemaker hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (HCN) are considered integral to SWD genesis, making them an ideal gene candidate for GGE. We identified HCN2 missense variants from a large cohort of 585 GGE patients, recruited by the Epilepsy Phenome-Genome Project (EPGP), and performed functional analysis using two-electrode voltage clamp recordings from Xenopus oocytes. The p.S632W variant was identified in a patient with idiopathic photosensitive occipital epilepsy and segregated in the family. This variant was also independently identified in an unrelated patient with childhood absence seizures from a European cohort of 238 familial GGE cases. The p.V246M variant was identified in a patient with photo-sensitive GGE and his father diagnosed with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Functional studies revealed that both p.S632W and p.V246M had an identical functional impact including a depolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of activation that is consistent with a gain-of-function. In contrast, no biophysical changes resulted from the introduction of common population variants, p.E280K and p.A705T, and the p.R756C variant from EPGP that did not segregate with disease. Our data suggest that HCN2 variants can confer susceptibility to GGE via a gain-of-function mechanism.","['1 Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', '2 School of Biosciences, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', '3 Epilepsy Research Centre, Department of Medicine, The University of Melbourne, Austin Health, Heidelberg, Victoria, Australia.', '4 Laboratory of Neurogenetics, Department of Neuroscience, Institute ""G.

910,A novel mechanobiological model can predict how physiologically relevant dynamic loading causes proteoglycan loss in mechanically injured articular cartilage,"Cartilage provides low-friction properties and plays an essential role in diarthrodial joints. A hydrated ground substance composed mainly of proteoglycans (PGs) and a fibrillar collagen network are the main constituents of cartilage. Unfortunately, traumatic joint loading can destroy this complex structure and produce lesions in tissue, leading later to changes in tissue composition and, ultimately, to post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA). Consequently, the fixed charge density (FCD) of PGs may decrease near the lesion. However, the underlying mechanisms leading to these tissue changes are unknown. Here, knee cartilage disks from bovine calves were injuriously compressed, followed by a physiologically relevant dynamic compression for twelve days. FCD content at different follow-up time points was assessed using digital densitometry. A novel cartilage degeneration model was developed by implementing deviatoric and maximum shear strain, as well as fluid velocity controlled algorithms to simulate the FCD loss as a function of time. Predicted loss of FCD was quite uniform around the cartilage lesions when the degeneration algorithm was driven by the fluid velocity, while the deviatoric and shear strain driven mechanisms exhibited slightly discontinuous FCD loss around cracks. Our degeneration algorithm predictions fitted well with the FCD content measured from the experiments. The developed model could subsequently be applied for prediction of FCD depletion around different cartilage lesions and for suggesting optimal rehabilitation protocols.","['1 Department of Applied Physics, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland. gustavo.orozco@uef.fi.', '2 Department of Applied Physics, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland.', '3 Departments of Biological Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA.']","Gustavo A Orozco, Petri Tanska, Cristina Florea, Alan J Grodzinsky, Rami K Korhonen, ",Scientific reports,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30348953

Here, a stretchable triboelectric-photonic smart skin (STPS) is reported that enables multidimensional tactile and gesture sensing for a robotic hand. With a grating-structured metal film as the bioinspired skin stripe, the STPS exhibits a tunable aggregation-induced emission in a lateral tensile range of 0-160%. Moreover, the STPS can be used as a triboelectric nanogenerator for vertical pressure sensing with a maximum sensitivity of 34 mV Pa-1 . The pressure sensing characteristics can remain stable in different stretching conditions, which demonstrates a synchronous and independent sensing property for external stimuli with great durability. By integrating on a robotic hand as a conformal covering, the STPS shows multidimensional mechanical sensing abilities for external touch and different gestures with joints bending. This work has first demonstrated a triboelectric-photonic coupled multifunctional sensing terminal, which may have great applications in human-machine interaction, soft robots, and artificial intelligence.","['1 CAS Center for Excellence in Nanoscience, Beijing Key Laboratory of Micro-Nano Energy and Sensor, Beijing Institute of Nanoenergy and Nanosystems, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100083, P.

913,Paired Associative Stimulation Delivered by Pairing Movement-Related Cortical Potentials With Peripheral Electrical Stimulation: An Investigation of the Duration of Neuromodulatory Effects,"Background:
      
    

    
      Novel paired associative stimulation (novel-PAS), delivered by pairing movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs) with electrical stimulation of somatosensory afferents, is an innovative neuromodulatory intervention. Novel-PAS results in increased corticomotor excitability and has potential as a rehabilitative adjunct to improve outcomes following stroke. The duration of its excitatory effect has important implications for how this novel PAS intervention might be applied within a traditional therapy session, but previous research has not explored its effects beyond 30 min post-intervention. Objective:
      
    

    
      The objective was to explore changes in corticomotor excitability in healthy participants, over a 60-min period following a single session of novel-PAS. Materials and method:
      
    

    
      Ten healthy adults completed a single session of novel-PAS, delivered by pairing 50 MRCPs with peripheral electrical stimulation. TMS was used to elicit motor evoked potentials (MEPs) of the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle, immediately prior to the intervention, and at 0, 30, 45, and 60 min post-intervention. Results:
      
    

    
      When compared with pre-intervention, there was a statistically significant increase in the mean TA MEP amplitudes at 0 (p = 0.006), 30 (p = 0.006), 45 (p = 0.027), and 60 min post-intervention (p = 0.020). Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Corticomotor excitability is increased for 60 min following this novel-PAS intervention. Future research could investigate the optimal method of combining this neuromodulatory technique with traditional therapy.","['1 Health and Rehabilitation Research Institute, Auckland University of Technology, Auckland, New Zealand.', '2 New Zealand College of Chiropractic, Auckland, New Zealand.', '3 Centre for Sensory-Motor Interaction, Department of Health Science and Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark.']","Sharon Olsen, Nada Signal, Imran Khan Niazi, Thomas Christensen, Mads Jochumsen, Denise Taylor, ",Neuromodulation : journal of the International Neuromodulation Society,2018 Jun,Brain-computer interfaces (MeSH); movement related cortical potential; neuronal plasticity (MeSH); paired associative stimulation; rehabilitation (MeSH); stroke (MeSH).,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28580648

Here, we sample a longitudinal wellness cohort with 100 healthy individuals and analyze blood molecular profiles including proteomics, transcriptomics, lipidomics, metabolomics, autoantibodies and immune cell profiling, complemented with gut microbiota composition and routine clinical chemistry. Overall, our results show high variation between individuals across different molecular readouts, while the intra-individual baseline variation is low. The analyses show that each individual has a unique and stable plasma protein profile throughout the study period and that many individuals also show distinct profiles with regards to the other omics datasets, with strong underlying connections between the blood proteome and the clinical chemistry parameters.

915,Imaging and the completion of the omics paradigm in breast cancer,"Within the field of oncology, ""omics"" strategies-genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics-have many potential applications and may significantly improve our understanding of the underlying processes of cancer development and progression. Omics strategies aim to develop meaningful imaging biomarkers for breast cancer (BC) by rapid assessment of large datasets with different biological information. In BC the paradigm of omics technologies has always favored the integration of multiple layers of omics data to achieve a complete portrait of BC. Advances in medical imaging technologies, image analysis, and the development of high-throughput methods that can extract and correlate multiple imaging parameters with ""omics"" data have ushered in a new direction in medical research. Radiogenomics is a novel omics strategy that aims to correlate imaging characteristics (i. e., the imaging phenotype) with underlying gene expression patterns, gene mutations, and other genome-related characteristics. Radiogenomics not only represents the evolution in the radiology-pathology correlation from the anatomical-histological level to the molecular level, but it is also a pivotal step in the omics paradigm in BC in order to fully characterize BC. Armed with modern analytical software tools, radiogenomics leads to new discoveries of quantitative and qualitative imaging biomarkers that offer hitherto unprecedented insights into the complex tumor biology and facilitate a deeper understanding of cancer development and progression. The field of radiogenomics in breast cancer is rapidly evolving, and results from previous studies are encouraging. It can be expected that radiogenomics will play an important role in the future and has the potential to revolutionize the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of BC patients. This article aims to give an overview of breast radiogenomics, its current role, future applications, and challenges.","['1 Department of Radiology, Breast Imaging Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 300 E 66th St, 7th Floor, 10065, New York, NY, USA.', '2 Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.', '3 Department of Biomedical Imaging and Image-guided Therapy, Division of Molecular and Gender Imaging, Medical University Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', '4 Department of Radiology, Breast Imaging Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 300 E 66th St, 7th Floor, 10065, New York, NY, USA. pinkerdk@mskcc.org.', '5 Department of Biomedical Imaging and Image-guided Therapy, Division of Molecular and Gender Imaging, Medical University Vienna, Vienna, Austria. pinkerdk@mskcc.org.']","D Leithner, J V Horvat, R E Ochoa-Albiztegui, S Thakur, G Wengert, E A Morris, T H Helbich, K Pinker, ",Der Radiologe,2018 Nov,Biomarkers; Breast neoplasms; Diffusion-weighted imaging; Gene expression; Magnetic resonance imaging; Molecular subtypes.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29947931

However, there is limited data regarding adherence to this recommendation among the pediatric community. To assess current clinical practices for CIED ABX prophylaxis in pediatrics; whether the AHA guidelines are being followed; and if not, the reasons for non-adherence. An anonymous web-based survey was sent to physician members of the Pediatric And Congenital Electrophysiology Society regarding ABX prophylaxis for new CIED implants and reoperations. 75 (25%) members responded. Only 7% of respondents follow the 2010 AHA guidelines. While all respondents give pre-OP IV ABX, 64% routinely treat patients with 24-h post-OP IV ABX with additional oral or IV therapy. 69% of respondents are cognizant of the guidelines but 88% of those cognizant do not follow the guidelines for a variety of reasons including lack of data and different substrate (pediatric patients). 79% stated that pediatric-specific data would be required for them to change their practice and follow the published guidelines. The majority of pediatric EP physicians who responded to this survey do not follow the current AHA guidelines on ABX prophylaxis and administer post-OP ABX.

      Chronic recordings with multi-electrode arrays are widely used to study neural networks underlying complex primate behaviors. Most of these systems are designed for studying neural activity in the cortical hemispheres resulting in a lack of devices being capable of simultaneously recording from ensembles of neurons in deep brainstem structures.

      We report a light-weight system that simultaneously measures single-unit activity from a large number of recording sites in the brainstem of marmoset monkeys. It includes a base chamber fixed to the animal's skull and a removable upper chamber that can be semi-chronically mounted to the base chamber to flexibly position an embedded micro-drive containing a 32-channel laminar probe to record from various positions within the brainstem for several weeks.

921,Peripheral neuropathies: Diagnostic strategy,"Diagnosing a peripheral neuropathy is sometimes challenging, as the causes are diverse and the clinical pictures heterogeneous. Overall, diagnosing a patient with peripheral neuropathy will require some knowledge in almost every field of medicine. Therefore, it appears crucial to adopt a diagnostic strategy that is based on solid clinical and neurophysiological grounds. The present paper describes a three-step diagnostic strategy: (1) to delineate a clinico-pathologic entity from clinical and electrodiagnostic findings; (2) to propose a list of plausible causes based on step one, history and clinical context; (3) to use appropriate workup in order to determine the cause or mechanism of the neuropathy. The three steps of this diagnostic strategy necessitate a high level of expertise and interaction between physicians is highly desirable. Finally, an aggressive course and a severe impairment should lead to relentlessly look for a curable cause.","['1 Service et laboratoire de neurologie, centre de référence «\xa0neuropathies périphériques rares\xa0», FILNEMUS, EA 6309 «\xa0maintenance myélinique et neuropathies périphériques\xa0», CHU Dupuytren, 2, avenue Martin-Luther-King, 87 042 Limoges cedex, France.

922,A nanoelectrode array for obtaining intracellular recordings from thousands of connected neurons,"Current electrophysiological or optical techniques cannot reliably perform simultaneous intracellular recordings from more than a few tens of neurons. Here we report a nanoelectrode array that can simultaneously obtain intracellular recordings from thousands of connected mammalian neurons in vitro. The array consists of 4,096 platinum-black electrodes with nanoscale roughness fabricated on top of a silicon chip that monolithically integrates 4,096 microscale amplifiers, configurable into pseudocurrent-clamp mode (for concurrent current injection and voltage recording) or into pseudovoltage-clamp mode (for concurrent voltage application and current recording). We used the array in pseudovoltage-clamp mode to measure the effects of drugs on ion-channel currents. In pseudocurrent-clamp mode, the array intracellularly recorded action potentials and postsynaptic potentials from thousands of neurons. In addition, we mapped over 300 excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections from more than 1,700 neurons that were intracellularly recorded for 19 min. This high-throughput intracellular-recording technology could benefit functional connectome mapping, electrophysiological screening and other functional interrogations of neuronal networks.","['1 John A.

929,Unpacking Transient Event Dynamics in Electrophysiological Power Spectra,"Electrophysiological recordings of neuronal activity show spontaneous and task-dependent changes in their frequency-domain power spectra. These changes are conventionally interpreted as modulations in the amplitude of underlying oscillations. However, this overlooks the possibility of underlying transient spectral 'bursts' or events whose dynamics can map to changes in trial-average spectral power in numerous ways. Under this emerging perspective, a key challenge is to perform burst detection, i.e. to characterise single-trial transient spectral events, in a principled manner. Here, we describe how transient spectral events can be operationalised and estimated using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). The HMM overcomes a number of the limitations of the standard amplitude-thresholding approach to burst detection; in that it is able to concurrently detect different types of bursts, each with distinct spectral content, without the need to predefine frequency bands of interest, and does so with less dependence on a priori threshold specification. We describe how the HMM can be used for burst detection and illustrate its benefits on simulated data. Finally, we apply this method to empirical data to detect multiple burst types in a task-MEG dataset, and illustrate how we can compute burst metrics, such as the task-evoked timecourse of burst duration.","['1 Department of Psychiatry, Oxford Centre for Human Brain Activity, Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK. andrew.quinn@psych.ox.ac.uk.', '2 Department of Psychiatry, Oxford Centre for Human Brain Activity, Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', '3 Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham, University Park, Nottingham, NG7 2RD, UK.', '4 Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging, Oxford Centre for Functional MRI of the Brain, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', '5 Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.']","Andrew J Quinn, Freek van Ede, Matthew J Brookes, Simone G Heideman, Magdalena Nowak, Zelekha A Seedat, Diego Vidaurre, Catharina Zich, Anna C Nobre, Mark W Woolrich, ",Brain topography,2019 Nov,Bursting; Dynamics; Electrophysiology; Hidden Markov model; Spectrum.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31754933

      The prokinetic action of erythromycin is clinically useful under conditions associated with gastrointestinal hypomotility. Although erythromycin is known to affect the electrogastrogram, no studies have examined the effects that erythromycin has on gastric slow wave magnetic fields. Methods:
      
    

    
      In this study, gastric slow wave activity was assessed simultaneously using noninvasive magnetogastrogram (MGG), electrogastrogram, and mucosal electromyogram recordings. Recordings were obtained for 30 min prior to and 60 min after intravenous administration of erythromycin at dosages of 3 and 6 mg/kg. Results:
      
    

    
      MGG recordings showed significant changes in the percentage power distribution of gastric signal after infusion of both 3 and 6 mg/kg erythromycin at t = 1-5 min that persisted for t = 30-40 min after infusion. These changes agree with the changes observed in the electromyogram. We did not observe any statistically significant difference in MGG amplitude before or after injection of either 3 or 6 mg/kg erythromycin. Both 3 and 6 mg/kg erythromycin infusion showed retrograde propagation with a statistically significant decrease in slow wave propagation velocity 11-20 min after infusion. Propagation velocity started returning toward baseline values after approximately 21-30 min for the 3 mg/kg dosage and after 31-40 min for a dosage of 6 mg/kg. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Our results showed that the magnetic signatures were sensitive to disruptions in normal slow wave activity induced by pharmacological and prokinetic agents such as erythromycin. Significance:

      A good quality CMAP was obtained in all subjects after stimulation of the frontal branch, but only in 64.5% of nerves after stimulation of the main trunk of the facial nerve. Furthermore, nerve conduction studies of the frontal branch required less intense stimuli and were better tolerated. Conclusions:

937,Origins of the changing detector response in small megavoltage photon radiation fields,"Differences in detector response between measured small fields, f clin, and wider reference fields, f msr , can be overcome by using correction factors [Formula: see text] or by designing detectors with field-size invariant responses. The changing response in small fields is caused by perturbations of the electron fluence within the detector sensitive volume. For solid-state detectors, it has recently been suggested that these perturbations might be caused by the non-water-equivalent effective atomic numbers Z of detector materials, rather than by their non-water-like densities. Using the EGSnrc Monte Carlo code we have analyzed the response of a PTW 60017 diode detector in a 6 MV beam, calculating the [Formula: see text] correction factor from computed doses absorbed by water and by the detector sensitive volume in 0.5 × 0.5 and 4 × 4 cm2 fields. In addition to the 'real' detector, fully modelled according to the manufacturer's blue-prints, we calculated doses and [Formula: see text] factors for a 'Z → water' detector variant in which mass stopping-powers and microscopic interaction coefficients were set to those of water while preserving real material densities, and for a 'density → 1' variant in which densities were set to 1 g cm-3, leaving mass stopping-powers and interaction coefficients at real levels. [Formula: see text] equalled 0.910 ± 0.005 (2 standard deviations) for the real detector, was insignificantly different at 0.912 ± 0.005 for the 'Z → H2O' variant, but equalled 1.012 ± 0.006 for the 'density → 1' variant. For the 60017 diode in a 6 MV beam, then, [Formula: see text] was determined primarily by the detector's density rather than its atomic composition. Further calculations showed this remained the case in a 15 MV beam. Interestingly, the sensitive volume electron fluence was perturbed more by detector atomic composition than by density; however, the density-dependent perturbation varied with field-size, whereas the Z-dependent perturbation was relatively constant, little affecting [Formula: see text].","['1 Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, The Sherrington Building, Ashton Street, Liverpool L69 3BX, United Kingdom.

939,Effects of pupillary responses to luminance and attention on visual spatial discrimination,"The optic quality of the eyes is, at least in part, determined by pupil size. Large pupils let more light enter the eyes, but degrade the point spread function, and thus the spatial resolution that can be achieved (Campbell & Gregory, 1960). In natural conditions, the pupil is mainly driven by the luminance (and possibly the color and contrast) at the gazed location, but is also modulated by attention and cognitive factors. Whether changes in eyes' optics related to pupil size modulation by luminance and attention impacts visual processing was assessed in two experiments. In Experiment 1, we measured pupil size using a constantly visible display made of four disks with different luminance levels, with no other task than fixating the disks in succession. The results confirmed that pupil size depends on the luminance of the gazed stimulus. Experiment 2, using similar settings as Experiment 1, used a two-interval forced-choice design to test whether discriminating high spatial frequencies that requires covert attention to parafoveal stimuli is better during the fixation of bright disks that entails a small pupil size, and hence better eyes' optics, as compared to fixating dark disks that entails a large pupil size, and hence poorer eyes' optics. As in Experiment 1, we observed large modulations of pupil size depending on the luminance of the gazed stimulus, but pupil dynamics was more variable, with marked pupil dilation during stimulus encoding, presumably because the demanding spatial frequency discrimination task engaged attention. However, discrimination performance and mean pupil size were not correlated. Despite this lack of correlation, the slopes of pupil dilation during stimulus encoding were correlated to performance, while the slopes of pupil dilation during decision-making were not. We discuss these results regarding the possible functional roles of pupil size modulations.","['1 Sorbonne Université, INSERM, CNRS, Institut de la Vision, Paris, France.']","Suzon Ajasse, Ryad B Benosman, Jean Lorenceau, ",Journal of vision,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30347093
940,Linearization of excitatory synaptic integration at no extra cost,"In many theories of neural computation, linearly summed synaptic activation is a pervasive assumption for the computations performed by individual neurons. Indeed, for certain nominally optimal models, linear summation is required. However, the biophysical mechanisms needed to produce linear summation may add to the energy-cost of neural processing. Thus, the benefits provided by linear summation may be outweighed by the energy-costs. Using voltage-gated conductances in a relatively simple neuron model, this paper quantifies the cost of linearizing dendritically localized synaptic activation. Different combinations of voltage-gated conductances were examined, and many are found to produce linearization; here, four of these models are presented. Comparing the energy-costs to a purely passive model, reveals minimal or even no additional costs in some cases.","['1 Physics Department, Emory & Henry College, Emory, VA, 24327, USA.', '2 Departments of Neurosurgery and of Psychology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, 22904, USA.', '3 Departments of Neurosurgery and of Psychology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, 22904, USA. wbl@virginia.edu.']","Danielle Morel, Chandan Singh, William B Levy, ",Journal of computational neuroscience,2018 Apr,Biophysical model; Metabolic cost; Mixed-cation channel; Sodium channel; Voltage-gated conductances.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29372434

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the dose rate and energy dependency of methacrylic acid gelatin tetrakis (hydroxymethyl) phosphonium chloride (MAGAT) gel in unflattened photon beam using X-ray computed tomography (CT) and ultraviolet (UV)-visible spectroscopy. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      MAGAT gel was prepared and it was exposed to 6 MV flattened and unflattened beams. The dose selected for irradiation was ranging from 3 to 15 Gy with an increment of 3 Gy. The dose rate dependency of the gel was investigated by exposing the gel to three different dose rates of 250, 500, and 1500 cGy/min for flattening filter free (FFF). To verify the energy dependency of the gel, it was exposed by both FFF and flattening filter (FF) for constant dose rate (250 cGy/min) and different energy (6 and 10 MV X-ray photons). The exposed gels were scanned by X-ray CT and UV-visible spectrophotometer. Results:
      
    

    
      The change in dose sensitivity observed over the dose rate from 250 cGy/min to 1500 cGy/min was 58.00% and 57.89% using a UV-visible spectrophotometer and X-ray CT analysis method. Energy dependency was evaluated with respect to dose sensitivity and the variation between 6 MV FF and FFF photon beams was found to be 2.20% and 2.21% using UV-visible spectrophotometer analysis and X-ray CT, respectively. Similarly, the variation noticed with 10 MV FF and FFF was 2.30% using UV-visible spectrophotometer analysis and 2.22% using X-ray CT analysis. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The results clearly show that the MAGAT gel was highly dose rate-dependent and less dependent on energy. The beam quality variation between FF and FFF was less. The similar results obtained using X-ray CT scanner and UV-visible spectrophotometer indicate that this study can be recommended for polymer gel scanning procedure.","['1 Department of Physics, Medical Gel Dosimetry Laboratory, School of Advanced Sciences, VIT University, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India.']","P Sathiyaraj, James Jebaseelan Samuel, ",Journal of cancer research and therapeutics,Jan-Mar 2018,Dose rate; X-ray computed tomography; methacrylic acid gelatin tetrakis (hydroxymethyl) phosphonium chloride gel; ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29516908
942,Bionic Single-Electrode Electronic Skin Unit Based on Piezoelectric Nanogenerator,"Moravec's paradox shows that low-level sensorimotor skills are more difficult than high-level reasoning in artificial intelligence and robotics. So simplifying every sensing unit on electronic skin is critical for endowing intelligent robots with tactile and temperature sense. The human nervous system is characterized by efficient single-electrode signal transmission, ensuring the efficiency and reliability of information transmission under big data conditions. In this work, we report a sensor based on a single-electrode piezoelectric nanogenerator (SPENG) by electrospun polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanofibers that can realize steady-state sensing of pressure integrating cold/heat sensing on a single unit. Piezoelectric signals appear as square wave signals, and the thermal-sensing signals appear as pulse signals. Therefore, the two signals can be acquired by a single unit simultaneously. The SPENG overcomes the shortcoming of electronic skins based on a single-electrode triboelectric nanogenerator (STENG), which can sense only dynamic movement and cannot sense temperature variations. The new sensor configuration uses a capacitor instead of the STENG's ground wire as a potential reference, allowing it to be used for truly autonomous robots. At the same time, the traditional advantages of polymer piezoelectric materials, such as flexibility, transparency, and self-powered advantages, have also been preserved.","['1 Collaborative Innovation Center for Nanomaterials & Devices, College of Physics , Qingdao University , Qingdao 266071 , China.', '2 Department of Mechanical Engineering , Columbia University , New York , New York 10027 , United States.', '3 Department of Electronic & Computer Engineering , The Hong Kong University of Science & Technology , Kowloon , Hong Kong , China.', '4 Center for Nanofibers & Nanotechnology , National University of Singapore , Singapore 119077 , Singapore.']","Xiaoxiong Wang, Wei-Zhi Song, Ming-Hao You, Jun Zhang, Miao Yu, Zhiyong Fan, Seeram Ramakrishna, Yun-Ze Long, ",ACS nano,2018,electronic skin; electrospinning; piezoelectric nanogenerators; polyvinylidene fluoride; single-electrode sensor.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30102853

944,Using Microscale Thermophoresis to Characterize Hits from High-Throughput Screening: A European Lead Factory Perspective,"High-throughput screening (HTS) is a proven method for discovering new lead matter for drug discovery and chemical biology. To maximize the likelihood of identifying genuine binders to a molecular target, and avoid wasting resources following up compounds with unproductive/nonspecific mechanisms of action, it is important to employ a range of assays during an HTS campaign that build confidence of target engagement for hit compounds. Biophysical methods that measure direct target/compound engagement have established themselves as key techniques in generating this confidence, and they are now integral to the latter stages of HTS triage at the European Lead Factory (ELF). One relatively new technique that the ELF is using is microscale thermophoresis (MST), which measures the differences in rate of movement through a temperature gradient that are caused when single molecular species form complexes. Here we provide an overview of the MST assay development workflow that the ELF employs and a perspective of our experience to date of using MST to triage the output of HTS campaigns and how it compares and contrasts with the use of other biophysical techniques.","['1 1 European Screening Centre Newhouse, Biocity Scotland, University of Dundee, Newhouse, UK.']","Julie M Rainard, George C Pandarakalam, Stuart P McElroy, ",SLAS discovery : advancing life sciences R & D,2018 Mar,assay development; biophysical assays; drug discovery; high-throughput screening; microscale thermophoresis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29460707
945,Conflict and adaptation signals in the anterior cingulate cortex and ventral tegmental area,"The integration and utilization of feedback in order to determine which decision strategy to use in different contexts is the core of executive function. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is central to these processes but how feedback is made available to the ACC is unclear. To address this question, we trained rats with implants in the ACC and the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a dopaminergic brain region implicated in feedback processing, in a spatial decision reversal task with rule switching occurring approximately every 12 trials. Following a rule switch, the rats had to shift and sustain responses to the alternative side in order to obtain reward. Partial directed coherence (PDC) models of signal directionality between the ACC and VTA indicated that VTA → ACC communication (near 4 Hz) increased immediately prior to incorrect choices and during post-error decisions. This increase did not occur during correct choices. These data indicate that the VTA provides a feedback-driven, bottom-up modulating signal to the ACC which may be involved in assessing, and correcting for, decision conflict.","['1 Department of Psychology, University of Otago, Dunedin, 9016, New Zealand. telston@nurhopsi.org.', '2 Brain Health Research Centre, University of Otago, Dunedin, 9016, New Zealand. telston@nurhopsi.org.', '3 Institute for Neurobiology, University of Tübingen, Tübingen, 72076, Germany. telston@nurhopsi.org.', '4 Department of Psychology, University of Otago, Dunedin, 9016, New Zealand.', '5 Brain Health Research Centre, University of Otago, Dunedin, 9016, New Zealand.']","Thomas W Elston, Shivam Kalhan, David K Bilkey, ",Scientific reports,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30082775

Although the efficient collection of emitted light is critical to attain high-contrast spatiotemporal information, the intrinsic low numerical aperture of the endoscopic probe poses a physical limitation. We report a simple solution to overcome this limit by incorporating a reflective waveguide ensheathing the endoscopic probe, which improves the collection efficiency by approximately two-fold.

947,Feasibility study of using flattening-filter-free photon beams to deliver conventional flat beams,"Various dosimetric benefits such as increased dose rate, and reduced leakage and out of field dose have led to the growth of flattening-filter-free (FFF) technology in the clinic. In this study, we concentrate on investigating the feasibility of using FFF beams to deliver conventional flat beams, since completely getting rid of the flattening-filter module from the gantry head can not only simplify the gantry design but also decrease the workload on machine maintenance and quality assurance. Two intensity modulated radiotherapy techniques, step-and-shoot (S&S) and sliding window (SW), were used to generate flat beam profiles for 6 regular-shaped beams and 3 clinical beams while operating in FFF mode. The inverse plans were generated based on uniform dose optimization. Degree of flatness, MU efficiency, and beam delivery time for both methods were assessed. S&S technique is able to achieve a degree of flatness less than 2.5% for most field configurations. While SW technique was able to generate relatively flat beams for field sizes less than 18 × 18 cm2. For all field configurations, S&S beams resulted in a longer delivery time compared to reference flat beams and SW beams. For field sizes less than 18 × 18 cm2, SW modulated FFF beams resulted in a faster delivery time compared to reference flat beams. The ability to deliver conventional flat beams is not absent when operating in FFF mode. Utilizing beam modulation, FFF mode can achieve reasonable flat profiles and comparable efficiency to conventional flat beams. The ability to deliver most clinical treatments from the same treatment unit will allow for less quality assurance as well as maintenance, and completely eliminate the need for the flattening filter on modern linacs.","['1 Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610.

948,Active High-Density Electrode Arrays: Technology and Applications in Neuronal Cell Cultures,"Active high-density electrode arrays realized with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology provide electrophysiological recordings from several thousands of closely spaced microelectrodes. This has drastically advanced the spatiotemporal recording resolution of conventional multielectrode arrays (MEAs). Thus, today's electrophysiology in neuronal cultures can exploit label-free electrical readouts from a large number of single neurons within the same network. This provides advanced capabilities to investigate the properties of self-assembling neuronal networks, to advance studies on neurotoxicity and neurodevelopmental alterations associated with human brain diseases, and to develop cell culture models for testing drug- or cell-based strategies for therapies.Here, after introducing the reader to this neurotechnology, we summarize the results of different recent studies demonstrating the potential of active high-density electrode arrays for experimental applications. We also discuss ongoing and possible future research directions that might allow for moving these platforms forward for screening applications.","['1 Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT), Genova, Italy.', '2 Plasticity Models for Aging & Neurodegeneration Group, Deutsches Zentrum für Neurodegenerative Erkrankungen e.V.

949,Near-Infrared-Responsive Photoelectrochemical Aptasensing Platform Based on Plasmonic Nanoparticle-Decorated Two-Dimensional Photonic Crystals,"The photoelectrochemical (PEC) analysis is an emerging and fast developing biosensing technique. However, the in vivo PEC biosensing in deep tissue is seriously hampered because of the shallow penetration depth of ultraviolet and visible light. Expanding the optical absorption wavelength of photoelectrodes from the visible light region into the near-infrared (NIR) light region is highly desirable because of its deep tissue penetrability and minimal invasiveness for organisms, but the exploration of the facile strategy to implement efficient NIR absorption with good biocompatibility is still challenging. Herein, a NIR PEC aptasensor is proposed by coupling plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) into periodic two-dimensional nanocavity (NC) photonic crystals as photoelectrodes, where the Au NPs are sputtered on a periodic two-dimensional TiO2 NC photonic crystal substrate to significantly enhance the NIR PEC response and successfully achieve sensitive PEC detection of Hg2+ under irradiation of NIR light in blood. We believe that the proposed NIR-responsive Au/TiO2 NC-based PEC aptasensor will open a new in vivo biosensing model for a series of important biomolecules and pave up an avenue for the practical applications of PEC biosensing in deep tissue or even in organs and brain of the living body.","['1 Shanghai Key Laboratory of Green Chemistry and Chemical Processes, School of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering , East China Normal University , 500 Dongchuan Road , Shanghai 200241 , China.']","Zhenzhen Li, Xue Zhou, Jing Yang, Baihe Fu, Zhonghai Zhang, ",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019,aptasensor; near-infrared; photoelectrochemistry; photonic crystals; plasmonic resonance.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31140775
950,Spectral analysis of the EBT3 radiochromic films for clinical photon and electron beams,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      The purpose of this study was to investigate the spectral response of the EBT3 radiochromic films to different beam qualities for radiation therapy dosimetry. Dose, dose rate, and interbatch dependencies on the spectral response of the films were investigated as well. Methods:
      
    

    
      Pieces of EBT3 films placed between layers of solid water phantoms were irradiated with 6 and 15 MV photon beams, 6 and 10 MV-flattening filter free (FFF) photon beams, and 6 and 20 MeV electron beams at dose levels between 0.4 and 50 Gy. Net absorbance was measured as a function of wavelength from the spectra acquired in the wavelength range of 400-800 nm using a fiber-coupled spectrometer and broadband light source. Results:
      
    

    
      No significant change was observed in the absorption spectra of the EBT3 film from the same batch irradiated with the same amount of dose using different beam qualities. Also, no spectral change with dose rate was observed. The measured net absorbance per Gy was independent of beam quality in the 1-50 Gy dose range. Slight differences in the spectral shape and absorption band positions were observed in film samples from different batches. The net absorbance spectra showed two absorption bands centered around 634-636 nm (primary) and 583-585 nm (secondary). However, depending on the film batch, for doses above a certain level the primary absorption band appears to ""split"" into two bands centered around ~624-628 and ~641-645 nm. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The spectral shape of the EBT3 radiochromic films irradiated with photons (including FFF) and electron beams is beam quality and dose rate independent; however, it varies with dose level, batch, and spectroscopy system used.","['1 Department of Radiation Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, 63110, USA.', '2 Department of Chemistry, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, 63110, USA.']","Elsa Y León-Marroquín, Daniel J Mulrow, Rao Khan, Arash Darafsheh, ",Medical physics,2019 Feb,EBT3; absorption spectroscopy; film dosimetry; radiochromic film.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30536832

      Patients with the axial length of eyes less than 22 mm from previously reported studies. Methods:
      
    

    
      A comprehensive search in Pubmed, EMBASE, Cochrane Data Base of Systematic Reviews and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was conducted by October 2016. We assessed the methodological quality using a modified QUADAS-2 tool and performed analysis on weighted mean differences of mean absolute errors (MAE) among different formulas. Main outcomes measures:
      
    

    
      The between-group difference of MAE was evaluated with weighted mean difference and 95% confidence intervals. Results:
      
    

    
      Ten observational studies, involving 1161 eyes, were enrolled to compare six formulas: Haigis, Holladay 2, Hoffer Q, Holladay 1, SRK/T and SRK II. Among them, the Holladay 2 introduced the smallest overall MAE (0.496D) without statistical significance. The difference of MAE is statistically significant between Haigis and Hoffer Q (mean difference = -0.07D, P = 0.003), Haigis and SRK/T (mean difference = -0.07D, P = 0.009), Haigis and SRK II (mean difference = -0.41D, P = 0.01). For publication bias and small-study effect, neither funnel plot nor egger's test detected statistical finding. Conclusion and relevance:

952,A TPMS-based method for modeling porous scaffolds for bionic bone tissue engineering,"In the field of bone defect repair, gradient porous scaffolds have received increased attention because they provide a better environment for promoting tissue regeneration. In this study, we propose an effective method to generate bionic porous scaffolds based on the TPMS (triply periodic minimal surface) and SF (sigmoid function) methods. First, cortical bone morphological features (e.g., pore size and distribution) were determined for several regions of a rabbit femoral bone by analyzing CT-scans. A finite element method was used to evaluate the mechanical properties of the bone at these respective areas. These results were used to place different TPMS substructures into one scaffold domain with smooth transitions. The geometrical parameters of the scaffolds were optimized to match the elastic properties of a human bone. With this proposed method, a functional gradient porous scaffold could be designed and produced by an additive manufacturing method.","['1 School of Mechanical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, 211189, China.', '2 Jiangsu Key Laboratory of 3D Printing Equipment and Manufacturing, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, 210042, China.', '3 Department of Sports Medicine and Adult Reconstructive Surgery, Drum Tower Hospital affiliated to Medical School of Nanjing University, Nanjing, China.', '4 Jiangsu Key Laboratory of 3D Printing Equipment and Manufacturing, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, 210042, China. 61047@njnu.edu.cn.', '5 School of Mechanical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, 211189, China. xswang007@gmail.com.']","Jianping Shi, Liya Zhu, Lan Li, Zongan Li, Jiquan Yang, Xingsong Wang, ",Scientific reports,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29743648

955,Stimulation and Artifact-Suppression Techniques for In Vitro High-Density Microelectrode Array Systems,"We present novel voltage stimulation buffers with controlled output current, along with recording circuits featuring adjustable high-pass cut-off filtering to perform efficient stimulation while actively suppressing stimulation artifacts in high-density microelectrode arrays. Owing to the dense packing and close proximity of the electrodes in such systems, a stimulation through one electrode can cause large electrical artifacts on neighboring electrodes that easily saturate the corresponding recording amplifiers. To suppress such artifacts, the high-pass corner frequencies of all available 2048 recording channels can be raised from several Hz to several kHz by applying a ""soft-reset"" or pole-shifting technique. With the implemented artifact suppression technique, the saturation time of the recording circuits, connected to electrodes in immediate vicinity to the stimulation site, could be reduced to less than 150 μs. For the stimulation buffer, we developed a circuit, which can operate in two modes: either control of only the stimulation voltage or control of current and voltage during stimulation. The voltage-only controlled mode employs a local common-mode feedback operational transconductance amplifier with a near rail-to-rail input/output range, suitable for driving high-capacitive loads. The current/voltage controlled mode is based on a positive current conveyor generating adjustable output currents, whereas its upper and lower output voltages are limited by two feedback loops. The current/voltage controlled circuit can generate stimulation pulses up to 30 μA with less than ±0.1% linearity error in the low-current mode and up to 300 μA with less than ±0.2% linearity error in the high-current mode.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Amir Shadmani, Vijay Viswam, Yihui Chen, Raziyeh Bounik, Jelena Dragas, Milos Radivojevic, Sydney Geissler, Sergey Sitnikov, Jan Muller, Andreas Hierlemann, ",IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,2019 Sep,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30605090

We build models from 3D morphologies and somatic electrophysiological responses measured in the same cells. Densities of active somatic conductances and additional parameters are optimized with a genetic algorithm to match electrophysiological features. We evaluate the models by applying additional stimuli and comparing model responses to experimental data.

957,Recent advances in single-cell analysis by mass spectrometry,"Cells are the most basic structural units that play vital roles in the functioning of living organisms. Analysis of the chemical composition and content of a single cell plays a vital role in ensuring precise investigations of cellular metabolism, and is a crucial aspect of lipidomic and proteomic studies. In addition, structural knowledge provides a better understanding of cell behavior as well as the cellular and subcellular mechanisms. However, single-cell analysis can be very challenging due to the very small size of each cell as well as the large variety and extremely low concentrations of substances found in individual cells. On account of its high sensitivity and selectivity, mass spectrometry holds great promise as an effective technique for single-cell analysis. Numerous mass spectrometric techniques have been developed to elucidate the molecular profiles at the cellular level, including electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), laser-based mass spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). In this review, the recent advances in single-cell analysis by mass spectrometry are summarized. The strategies of different ionization modes to achieve single-cell analysis are classified and discussed in detail.","['1 Research Institute of Translational Medicine, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Jilin University, Dongminzhu Street, Changchun 130061, PR China. gujk@jlu.edu.cn.']","Lei Yin, Zhi Zhang, Yingze Liu, Yin Gao, Jingkai Gu, ",The Analyst,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30334031

The system can be used in applications that require interactive robots to recognize the contents of speech that includes ambient noise. The system comprises two stages, which are the threshold-based noise detection and the noise reduction procedure. In the first stage, the proposed system automatically determines when to enhance the quality of speech based on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values of the collected speech at all times. In the second stage, independent component analysis (ICA) and subspace speech enhancement (SSE) are employed for noise reduction. Experimental results reveal that the SNR values of the enhanced speech exceed those of the received noisy speech by approximately 20 dB to 25 dB. The noise reduction procedure improves the speech recognition rates by around 15% to 25%. The experimental results indicate that the proposed system can reduce the effect of noise in numerous noisy environments and improve the quality of speech for recognition purposes.","['1 Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, No. 1, Dasyue Road, Tainan City 701, Taiwan. appleway1984@gmail.com.', '2 Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, No. 1, Dasyue Road, Tainan City 701, Taiwan. wangjf@mail.ncku.edu.tw.', '3 Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, No. 1, Dasyue Road, Tainan City 701, Taiwan. tanchi2@yahoo.com.tw.']","Sheng-Chieh Lee, Jhing-Fa Wang, Miao-Hia Chen, ","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2018,automatic speech recognition; human-robot interaction; noise detection; noise reduction.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29958442

961,Remote fear memory is sensitive to reconditioning,"Exposure of some individuals to recurring traumatic events from the same perpetrator or situation, such as during child abuse or domestic violence, is quite prevalent. Studies have shown that the number of traumatic events experienced is positively related to the severity of post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental disorders. Using a contextual fear conditioning (Cond1) and reconditioning (Cond2) paradigm, which were separated by either 1 or 35 days, we examined fear responses to immediate extinction and retrieval-extinction procedures after repeated fear conditioning stress. Based on the time interval between Cond1 and Cond2, the animals were divided into recent and remote fear memory groups. We observed that when Cond2 was performed in the original conditioning context in which Cond1 was performed, the reconditioned remote fear memory was resistant to the disruptive effect of immediate extinction and retrieval-extinction paradigms. Furthermore, the resistance to disruptive effects could be induced by very low shock intensities, which cannot even induce any fear response in naive animals. When Cond2 was performed in a novel context, animals with remote fear memory acquired a significantly higher fear response to the novel context. Our findings suggest that remote fear memory may be more sensitive to reconditioning and resistant to post-reconditioning disruption.","['1 School of Educational Science, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China; Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Experimental & Translational Non-Coding RNA Research, School of Medicine, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China.', '2 School of Educational Science, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China.', '3 Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Experimental & Translational Non-Coding RNA Research, School of Medicine, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China; Institute of Comparative Medicine, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China; Jiangsu Co-Innovation Center for Prevention and Control of Important Animal Infectious Disease and Zoonosis, Yangzhou, China.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine how many runs are needed to define a stable or typical running pattern. Six biomechanical variables were recorded using a single wearable sensor placed on the lower back during ten outdoor runs for twelve runners. Univariate and multivariate distributions were created and based on the probability density function, the percent of similar data points (within 95%) from each unique run for the same runner were determined. Stability was defined when the addition of data from a new run resulted in less than a 5% change in the probability density function. To cross-validate, the percent of similar data points at stability was compared between the same and different runners using a repeated-measures MANOVA (Bonferroni-corrected α = 0.007). The maximum number of runs needed to reach stability for univariate and multivariate analyses was four and five, respectively. There was a significant overall effect on similar data points between the same and different runners (p = 0.001), with a greater percent of similar data points for the same runner compared to other runners (p < 0.007). Based on biomechanical data collected using a single wearable sensor placed on the lower back, this is the first study to show that four (univariate) to five (multivariate) runs are needed to establish a stable running pattern in real-world settings.","['1 University of Calgary, Faculty of Kinesiology, 2500 University Dr. NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.

ZnFDCA is the first reported achiral MOF showing optical activity, as demonstrated by a pair of circular dichroism signals with opposite signs and enhanced intensity. Moreover, simply through adding an amino substituent to adenine, the chiroptical activity, as well as nonlinear optical activity, of the analogous MOF, namely ZnFDCA-NH2, disappears due to diverse packing pattern giving rise to centrosymmetric crystal symmetry.","['1 Department of Chemistry , Shantou University , Guangdong 515063 , P.

965,Early clinical results of proton spatially fractionated GRID radiation therapy (SFGRT),"Objective:
      
    

    
      Approximately 70 patients with large and bulky tumors refractory to prior treatments were treated with photon spatially fractionated GRID radiation (SFGRT). We identified 10 additional patients who clinically needed GRID but could not be treated with photons due to adjacent critical organs. We developed a proton SFGRT technique, and we report treatment of these 10 patients. Methods:
      
    

    
      Subject data were reviewed for clinical results and dosimetric data. 50% of the patients were metastatic at the time of treatment and five had previous photon radiation to the local site but not via GRID. They were treated with 15-20 cobalt Gray equivalent using a single proton GRID field with an average beamlet count of 22.6 (range 7-51). 80% received an average adjuvant radiation dose to the GRID region of 40.8Gy (range 13.7-63.8Gy). Four received subsequent systemic therapy. Results:
      
    

    
      The median follow-up time was 5.9 months (1.1-18.9). At last follow-up, seven patients were alive and three had died. Two patients who had died from metastatic disease had local shrinkage of tumor. Of those alive, four had complete or partial response, two had partial response but later progressed, and one had no response. For all patients, the tumor regression/local symptom improvement rate was 80%. 50% had acute side-effects of grade1/2 only and all were well-tolerated. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      In circumstances where patients cannot receive photon GRID, proton SFGRT is clinically feasible and effective, with a similar side-effect profile. Advances in knowledge:
      
    

    
      Proton GRID should be considered as a treatment option earlier in the disease course for patients who cannot be treated by photon GRID.","['1 Northwestern Medicine Chicago Proton Center 4455 Weaver Pkwy, Warrenville, IL 60555.', '2 Radiation Oncology Consultants, Ltd. 700 Commerce Drive, Suite 500, Oak Brook, IL 60523.']","Majid Mohiuddin, Connor Lynch, Mingcheng Gao, William Hartsell, ",The British journal of radiology,2020 Mar,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31651185
966,Molecular mimicking of C-terminal phosphorylation tunes the surface dynamics of Ca V 1.2 calcium channels in hippocampal neurons,"L-type voltage-gated CaV1.2 calcium channels (CaV1.2) are key regulators of neuronal excitability, synaptic plasticity, and excitation-transcription coupling. Surface-exposed CaV1.2 distributes in clusters along the dendrites of hippocampal neurons. A permanent exchange between stably clustered and laterally diffusive extra-clustered channels maintains steady-state levels of CaV1.2 at dendritic signaling domains. A dynamic equilibrium between anchored and diffusive receptors is a common feature among ion channels and is crucial to modulate signaling transduction. Despite the importance of this fine regulatory system, the molecular mechanisms underlying the surface dynamics of CaV1.2 are completely unexplored. Here, we examined the dynamic states of CaV1.2 depending on phosphorylation on Ser-1700 and Ser-1928 at the channel C terminus. Phosphorylation at these sites is strongly involved in CaV1.2-mediated nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) signaling, long-term potentiation, and responsiveness to adrenergic stimulation. We engineered CaV1.2 constructs mimicking phosphorylation at Ser-1700 and Ser-1928 and analyzed their behavior at the membrane by immunolabeling protocols, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, and single particle tracking. We found that the phosphomimetic S1928E variant increases the mobility of CaV1.2 without altering the steady-state maintenance of cluster in young neurons and favors channel stabilization later in differentiation. Instead, mimicking phosphorylation at Ser-1700 promoted the diffusive state of CaV1.2 irrespective of the differentiation stage. Together, these results reveal that phosphorylation could contribute to the establishment of channel anchoring mechanisms depending on the neuronal differentiation state. Finally, our findings suggest a novel mechanism by which phosphorylation at the C terminus regulates calcium signaling by tuning the content of CaV1.2 at signaling complexes.","['1 From the Institute of Biophysics, Medical University of Graz, 8010 Graz, Austria.', '2 the Department of Pharmacology, University of California, Davis, California 95616.', '3 the Department of Physiology and Medical Physics, Medical University of Innsbruck, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria, and.', '4 the Leibniz Institute for Neurobiology, 39118 Magdeburg, Germany.', '5 From the Institute of Biophysics, Medical University of Graz, 8010 Graz, Austria, valentina.di-biase@medunigraz.at valentina.di.biase75@gmail.com.']","Alessandra Folci, Angela Steinberger, Boram Lee, Ruslan Stanika, Susanne Scheruebel, Marta Campiglio, Claudia Ramprecht, Brigitte Pelzmann, Johannes W Hell, Gerald J Obermair, Martin Heine, Valentina Di Biase, ",The Journal of biological chemistry,2018,L-type Ca2+ channels; Ser1700; Ser1928; dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR); excitatory; fluorescence; imaging; molecular dynamics; neuron; trafficking.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29180451
967,Cell Membrane Repair Assay Using a Two-photon Laser Microscope,"Numerous pathophysiological insults can cause damage to cell membranes and, when coupled with innate defects in cell membrane repair or integrity, can result in disease. Understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms surrounding cell membrane repair is, therefore, an important objective to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for diseases associated with dysfunctional cell membrane dynamics. Many in vitro and in vivo studies aimed at understanding cell membrane resealing in various disease contexts utilize two-photon laser ablation as a standard for determining functional outcomes following experimental treatments. In this assay, cell membranes are subjected to wounding with a two-photon laser, which causes the cell membrane to rupture and fluorescent dye to infiltrate the cell. The intensity of fluorescence within the cell can then be monitored to quantify the cell's ability to reseal itself. There are several alternative methods for assessing cell membrane response to injury, as well as great variation in the two-photon laser wounding approach itself, therefore, a single, unified model of cell wounding would beneficially serve to decrease the variation between these methodologies. In this article, we outline a simple two-photon laser wounding protocol for assessing cell membrane repair in vitro in both healthy and dysferlinopathy patient fibroblast cells transfected with or without a full-length dysferlin plasmid.","['1 Department of Medical Genetics, University of Alberta Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry.', '2 Center for iPS Cell Research and Application, Kyoto University.', '3 Department of Medical Genetics, University of Alberta Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry; toshifum@ualberta.ca.']","Joshua J A Lee, Rika Maruyama, Hidetoshi Sakurai, Toshifumi Yokota, ",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29364240
968,Refurbishment of an Au-coated toroidal mirror by capacitively coupled RF plasma discharge,"Deposition of synchrotron-radiation-induced carbon contamination on beamline optics causes their performance to deteriorate, especially near the carbon K edge. The photon flux losses due to carbon contamination have spurred researchers to search for a suitable decontamination technique to restore the optical surface and retain its performance. Several in situ and ex situ refurbishing strategies for beamline optics are still under development to solve this serious issue. In this work, the carbon contamination is removed from a large (340 mm × 60 mm) Au-coated toroidal mirror surface using a capacitively coupled low-pressure RF plasma. Before and after RF plasma cleaning, the mirror was characterized by Raman spectroscopy, soft X-ray reflectivity (SXR) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques. The Raman spectra of the contaminated mirror clearly show the G (1575-1590 cm-1) and D (1362-1380 cm-1) bands of graphitic carbon. The SXR curve of the contaminated mirror shows a clear dip near the critical momentum transfer of carbon, indicating the presence of carbon contamination on the mirror surface. This dip disappears after removal of the contamination layer by RF plasma exposure. A decrease in the intensities of the CO bands is also observed by optical emission spectrometry during plasma exposure. The AFM and SXR results suggest that the root-mean-square (r.m.s.) roughness of the mirror surface does not increase after plasma exposure.","['1 Soft X-ray Application Laboratory, Raja Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technology, Indore, Madhya Pradesh 452013, India.', '2 Laser Plasma Section, Raja Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technology, Indore, Madhya Pradesh 452013, India.', '3 Homi Bhabha National Institute, Anushakti Nagar, Mumbai 400094, India.']","Praveen Kumar Yadav, Mukund Kumar, Raj Kumar Gupta, Mangalika Sinha, J A Chakera, M H Modi, ",Journal of synchrotron radiation,2019,RF plasma; carbon contamination; soft X-ray reflectivity; synchrotron optics.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31274439
969,Interaction of semiochemicals with model lipid membranes: A biophysical approach,"Unravelling the chemical language of insects has been the subject of intense research in the field of chemical ecology for the past five decades. Insect communication is mainly based on chemosensation due to the small body size of insects, which limits their ability to produce or perceive auditory and visual signals, especially over large distances. Chemicals involved in insect communication are called semiochemicals. These volatiles and semivolatiles compounds allow to Insects to find a mate, besides the oviposition site in reproduction and food sources. Actually, insect olfaction mechanism is subject to study, but systematic analyses of the role of neural membranes are scarce. In the present work we evaluated the interactions of α-pinene, benzaldehyde, eugenol, and grandlure, among others, with a lipid membrane model using surface pressure experiments and Monte Carlo computational analysis. This allowed us to propose a plausible membranotropic mechanism of interaction between semiochemicals and insect neural membrane.","['1 Laboratory of Antioxidants and Oxidative Process, CITSE- National University of Santiago del Estero and CONICET, 4206 RN 9 Km 1125, Santiago del Estero, Argentina.

The integration of multiple physiological modalities for the routine acquisition of multimodal data with microelectrodes could be useful for biomedical applications, yet this has been challenging owing to incompatibilities of fabrication methods. Here, we present a suite of glass pipettes with integrated microelectrodes for the simultaneous acquisition of multimodal intracellular and extracellular information in vivo, electrochemistry assessments, and optogenetic perturbations of neural activity. We used the integrated devices to acquire multimodal signals from the CA1 region of the hippocampus in mice and rats, and show that these data can serve as ground-truth validation for the performance of spike-sorting algorithms.

972,Biophysical implications of Maxwell stress in electric field stimulated cellular microenvironment on biomaterial substrates,"A number of experimental studies have established the critical role of electric field stimulation on cell functionality modulation of various cell types on a wide range of biomaterial platforms in vitro. In particular, cell fate processes, morphological changes and electroporation are significantly modulated over a narrow range of electric field stimulation conditions. Although a few studies using electrical network theory, first principle simulations and electrohydrodynamic models are reported in the literature, the present study establishes a theoretical foundation to a new perspective that bioelectric stress can significantly influence cell morphological changes/electroporation and in a broader sense, the cell response to electric field on biomaterial substrates. A single cell is modelled as a spherical membrane separating the culture medium and the cytoplasm having different dielectric properties. The analytical solutions to the Laplace equation and Poisson equation for the system are adopted to quantitatively capture the potential distribution in the cellular microenvironment for different cases. These include a cell on a conducting substrate, on an insulating substrate and a cell with surface charge density, in electric field stimulated cellular microenvironment. The biophysical significance of the normal stress distribution has been discussed in terms of the variation in the cellular deformation, depending on the frequency of the electric field and substrate conductivity. A significant difference has been observed in the deformation behavior at higher frequencies (>109 Hz) compared to low frequency and DC electric fields. This theoretical study therefore unravels the significance of substrate conductivity in synergy with electric field parameters to modulate cell response. In addition, the tangential component of the Maxwell stress tensor (shear stress), a measure of the stretching force on the membrane, has been used to obtain estimates of the critical electric field required for membrane rupture. It has been predicted that a cell with surface charge density requires electric fields of the order of 10 kV/mm in order to undergo membrane rupture, which is in line with the experimental observations reported in the literature. Taken together, the presented analysis is expected to provide guidelines to develop next generation biomaterials and biomedical devices for regenerative medicine and cancer treatments.","['1 Materials Research Centre, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, 560012, India.', '2 Department of Chemical Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, 560012, India.', '3 Materials Research Centre, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, 560012, India.

As such, metabolomic analysis produces a global biochemical phenotype. It is a technology that has been utilized in the research setting for over a decade. The metabolome is directly linked to and is influenced by genetics, epigenetics, environmental factors, and the microbiome-all of which affect health. Metabolomics can be applied to human clinical diagnostics and to other fields such as veterinary medicine, nutrition, exercise, physiology, agriculture/plant biochemistry, and toxicology. Applications of metabolomics in clinical testing are emerging, but several aspects of its use as a clinical test differ from applications focused on research or biomarker discovery and need to be considered for metabolomics clinical test data to have optimum impact, be meaningful, and be used responsibly. In this review, we deconstruct aspects and challenges of metabolomics for clinical testing by illustrating the significance of test design, accurate and precise data acquisition, quality control, data processing, n-of-1 comparison to a reference population, and biochemical pathway analysis. We describe how metabolomics technology is integral to defining individual biochemical phenotypes, elaborates on human health and disease, and fits within the precision medicine landscape. Finally, we conclude by outlining some future steps needed to bring metabolomics into the clinical space and to be recognized by the broader medical and regulatory fields.","['1 Metabolon, Morrisville, NC, USA.', '2 Department of Molecular and Human Genetics and Baylor Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.']","Adam D Kennedy, Bryan M Wittmann, Anne M Evans, Luke A D Miller, Douglas R Toal, Shaun Lonergan, Sarah H Elsea, Kirk L Pappan, ",Journal of mass spectrometry : JMS,2018 Nov,Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA); College of American Pathologists (CAP); assay development; biochemical phenotype; biochemistry; biomarker; chromatography; clinical; laboratory developed test (LDT); longitudinal analysis; mass spectrometry; metabolomics; quality control; validation.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30242936

975,MnO 2 nanosheets as the biomimetic oxidase for rapid and sensitive oxalate detection combining with bionic E-eye,"Urolithiasis commonly occurs in kidney and ureteral, and may cause local organ/tissue damage, even kidney failure. The incidence of this disease is increasing worldwide, in which calcium oxalate is the major composition forming the urinary calculus. Therefore, to monitor this disease for the prevention and treatment, measuring the oxalate in the urine is of great significance. Here, a rapid and sensitive colorimetric method was developed based on 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine-manganese dioxide (TMB-MnO2) nanosheets for oxalate detection. MnO2 nanosheets acted as an efficient biomimetic oxidase to catalyze the reaction with TMB and oxalate. Pale yellow TMB can be oxidized to blue oxide TMB catalyzed by BSA-stabilized MnO2 nanosheets, and oxalate can selectively inhibit this reaction by consuming and reacting with MnO2 nanosheets, thus achieving the quantitative detection of oxalate. Moreover, a home-made bionic electronic-eye (E-eye) system was developed as a portable in-situ detection platform to efficiently measure the oxalate concentrations in 10 s by direct photographing. By optimizing experimental conditions, this method shows a wide linear range (7.8 μM to 250 μM) and a low detection limit (0.91 μM) for oxalate detection. Besides, this method exhibits high selectivity even with 80-fold interfering chemicals. Furthermore, the performance of the method was validated by testing the artificial urine samples, indicating its great potential for monitoring and diagnosis of urolithiasis in point-of-care applications.","['1 Biosensor National Special Laboratory, Key Laboratory of Biomedical Engineering of Ministry of Education, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310027, China; State Key Laboratory of Transducer Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200050, China.', '2 Biosensor National Special Laboratory, Key Laboratory of Biomedical Engineering of Ministry of Education, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310027, China.', '3 Laboratory of Chemical Sensors, Chemistry Department, Mendeleev Center, Saint-Petersburg State University, Saint-Petersburg 199034, Russia.', '4 Biosensor National Special Laboratory, Key Laboratory of Biomedical Engineering of Ministry of Education, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310027, China; State Key Laboratory of Transducer Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200050, China.

Optogenetics technology provides a novel approach for research on cardiac arrhythmia treatment, including pacing, recovering the conduction system, and achieving cardiac resynchronization with precise and low-energy optical control. Photosensitive proteins, which usually act as ion channels, pumps, or receptors, are delivered to target cells, where they respond to light pulses of specific wavelengths, evoke transient flows of transmembrane ion currents, and induce signal transmission. With the development of gene technology, the in vivo efficiency of optogenetics in cardiology has been trialed, and in vitro experiments have been performed to test its potential in cardiac electrophysiology. Challenges for applying optogenetics in large animals and humans include the effectiveness, safety, and long-term expression of photosensitive proteins, unscattered and unattenuated exogenous light stimulation, and the need for implantable miniature light stimulators. Photosensitive proteins, genetic engineering technology, and light equipment are essential for experiments in cardiac optogenetics.

This work has performed systematic numerical parametric study to investigate the nonlinear dependences of the hemisphere diffuse reflectance on gold-silica nanoshells, laser irradiance, and hosting biology tissue. Planar phantom based tissue models have been constructed as platforms for study. The radiant transport equation (RTE) has been applied to mathematically describe the interactions among laser lights, hosting tissues, and hosted nanoshells. The diffuse reflectance signal under various combinations of parametric conditions has been computed and analyzed. Parametric parameters whose effects on the diffuse reflectance signal have been investigated are: (1) optical properties of a nanoshell generic, (2) nanoshell volume fraction, which is an indicator of nanoshell accumulation in the target tissue site, (3) the width of irradiating laser beam, and (4) thickness of the tissue slab. Seven nanoshell generics have been tested as the exogenous contrast agent including the R[50, 10] (radius of silica core is 50 nm and thickness of gold shell is 10 nm), R[55, 25], R[40, 15], R[40, 40], R[104, 23], R[75, 40] and R[154, 24] nanoshells. It has been found the R[55, 25] nanoshell works best as the exogenous contrast agent, the R[75, 40] and R[104, 23] nanoshells show good potentials as well while the R[50, 10] and R[40, 15] nanoshells should be avoided for diagnostic usage. The practice of neglecting the absorption characteristic of the exogenous contrast agent, which is quite common among the bio-nano community, has been proven to end up with an over-prediction of the effectiveness of the exogenous contrast agent. Such practice therefore is not well justified and should be avoided in future research. Interactions among laser lights, the tissue and nanoshells are highly nonlinear, demonstrated by that nanoshell generics with totally different optical properties might have similar effects on the diffuse reflectance signal and vice versa. Prior to any bench experiment, preliminary numerical investigation as this work has showcased is highly recommended.","[""1 School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Guilin University of Electronic Technology, Guilin, People's Republic of China. xiao717@gmail.com.""]","Xiao Xu, ",Lasers in medical science,2019 Apr,Cancer detection; Gold-silica nanoshell; Lasers; Optical imaging.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30350124

The patient had a past history of intestinal bleeding, bifid uvula and hypothyroidism in his childhood. Repetitive nerve stimulation tests showed a decrement pattern in the left deltoid muscle. The single fiber electromyography of the left extensor digitorum muscle showed an increment of jitter. Both findings were improved by the edrophonium test. He was diagnosed as having phosphoglucomutase 1 (PGM1) deficiency, as the compound heterozygote mutation of the PGM1 gene was recognized in the whole-exome sequencing and the enzyme activity of PGM1 was defective in the biopsied muscle. Treatment with the galactose lead to improvement of the fluctuating muscle weakness and decremental pattern in the repetitive stimulation test. PGM1 deficiency should be listed in the differential diagnosis of the neuromuscular junction disorder, when the patient is seronegative for antibodies related with myasthenia gravis and shows symptoms or signs consistent with PGM1 deficiency.","['1 Division of Neurology, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine.', '2 Hyogo-Chuo National Hospital.', '3 Division of Neurogenetics, Center for Neurological Diseases and Cancer, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine.', '4 Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, Tokoha University.']","Yu Takenaka, Kenji Sekiguchi, Hiroaki Sekiya, Kinji Ohno, Hideo Sugie, Riki Matsumoto, ",Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,2020,congenital disorder of glycosylation; glycogenosis type XIV; phosphoglucomutase 1 deficiency; repetitive stimulation test; the neuromuscular junction disorder.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31956197
980,2D convolution kernels of ionization chambers used for photon-beam dosimetry in magnetic fields: the advantage of small over large chamber dimensions,"This study aims at developing an optimization strategy for photon-beam dosimetry in magnetic fields using ionization chambers. Similar to the familiar case in the absence of a magnetic field, detectors should be selected under the criterion that their measured 2D signal profiles M(x,y) approximate the absorbed dose to water profiles D(x,y) as closely as possible. Since the conversion of D(x,y) into M(x,y) is known as the convolution with the 'lateral dose response function' K(x-ξ, y-η) of the detector, the ideal detector would be characterized by a vanishing magnetic field dependence of this convolution kernel (Looe et al 2017b Phys. Med. Biol. 62 5131-48). The idea of the present study is to find out, by Monte Carlo simulation of two commercial ionization chambers of different size, whether the smaller chamber dimensions would be instrumental to approach this aim. As typical examples, the lateral dose response functions in the presence and absence of a magnetic field have been Monte-Carlo modeled for the new commercial ionization chambers PTW 31021 ('Semiflex 3D', internal radius 2.4 mm) and PTW 31022 ('PinPoint 3D', internal radius 1.45 mm), which are both available with calibration factors. The Monte-Carlo model of the ionization chambers has been adjusted to account for the presence of the non-collecting part of the air volume near the guard ring. The Monte-Carlo results allow a comparison between the widths of the magnetic field dependent photon fluence response function K M(x-ξ, y-η) and of the lateral dose response function K(x-ξ, y-η) of the two chambers with the width of the dose deposition kernel K D(x-ξ, y-η). The simulated dose and chamber signal profiles show that in small photon fields and in the presence of a 1.5 T field the distortion of the chamber signal profile compared with the true dose profile is weakest for the smaller chamber. The dose responses of both chambers at large field size are shown to be altered by not more than 2% in magnetic fields up to 1.5 T for all three investigated chamber orientations.","['1 University Clinic for Medical Radiation Physics, Medical Campus Pius Hospital, Carl von Ossietzky University, Oldenburg, Germany.']","Hui Khee Looe, Björn Delfs, Daniela Poppinga, Dietrich Harder, Björn Poppe, ",Physics in medicine and biology,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29516870
981,An Intra-Oral Optical Sensor for the Real-Time Identification and Assessment of Wine Intake,"Saliva has gained considerable attention as a diagnostics alternative to blood analyses. A wide spectrum of salivary compounds is correlated to blood concentrations of biomarkers, providing informative and discriminative data regarding the state of health. Intra-oral detection and assessment of food and beverage intake can be correlated and provides valuable information to forecast the formation and modification of salivary biomarkers. In this context, the present work proposes a novel intra-oral optical fiber sensor, developed around an optical coupler topology, and exemplified on the detection and assessment of wine intake, which is accounted for example for the formation of Nε-carboxymethyllysine Advanced Glycation End-products. A laboratory proof of concept validates the proposed solution on four white and four red wine samples.

      The purpose of this study was to investigate the beam quality dependence of the EBT-XD radiochromic films for megavoltage photon and electron beam irradiations by studying their spectral response. Dose, dose rate, and interbatch dependencies were investigated as well. Methods:
      
    

    
      EBT-XD and EBT3 radiochromic films were cut into 5 cm2 × 5 cm2 pieces, placed between solid water phantoms, and irradiated with 6 and 15 MV photon beams, 6 and 10 MV flattening filter free photon beams, and 6 and 20 MeV electron beams at dose levels between 0.5 and 50 Gy. In order to measure the spectral response, the films were illuminated by a deuterium and tungsten-halogen lamp and net absorption was measured in 400-800 nm spectral range using a fiber-coupled optical spectrometer. Film samples were then analyzed using a flatbed scanner in the red, green, and blue channel to obtain the optical density of the films. Results:
      
    

    
      The net absorption spectra of the EBT-XD and EBT3 films showed two absorption bands centered at 635 and 585 nm, characteristic of the EBT model. However, for a given dose, the EBT-XD films showed lower net absorbance compared to the EBT3 films. At a given dose level, the net absorption spectra and dose-response curves for EBT-XD films showed only slight variations across various beam qualities. When a calibration curve obtained from a given beam quality is used to measure dose from films irradiated with other beam qualities, the maximum uncertainty in the calculated dose, in ranges 5-40 and 8-50 Gy for red and green channels, respectively, were ~3.1% and ~2.4%. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The response of the EBT-XD films is dose rate independent but batch dependent. No significant beam quality dependence was observed in EBT-XD films in the dose range up to 50 Gy.","['1 Department of Radiation Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, 63110, USA.', '2 Department of Chemistry, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, 63110, USA.']","E Yazmin León-Marroquín, Daniel Mulrow, Arash Darafsheh, Rao Khan, ",Medical physics,2019 Sep,EBT-XD; EBT3; absorption spectroscopy; film dosimetry; radiochromic film.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31297824

Transcriptomics and proteomics provide a global snapshot of the abundance of gene products in a sample, from which researchers can learn a great deal about the inner machinations of a cell. However, when attempting to piece together a roadmap of an organism's metabolism, these strategies illuminate only a portion of the cellular landscape, and the evidence provided is often once- or even twice-removed from the actual players (the metabolites) involved.

In addition, patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) have a high risk of developing primary lung cancer. Prevention, risk estimation and a non-invasive diagnostics are essential to decrease COPD and lung cancer mortality. Therefore, better and more accurate molecular diagnostic markers (biomarkers) are needed for the early differential diagnosis of these lung diseases to help clinicians make better therapeutic decisions. This review focuses on recently discovered adenocarcinoma and COPD biomarkers at the proteome and glycome level. In the first part, the protein markers are summarized, while the second part is focused on glycan markers.

988,Anticipation via canards in excitable systems,"Neurons can anticipate incoming signals by exploiting a physiological mechanism that is not well understood. This article offers a novel explanation on how a receiver neuron can predict the sender's dynamics in a unidirectionally-coupled configuration, in which both sender and receiver follow the evolution of a multi-scale excitable system. We present a novel theoretical viewpoint based on a mathematical object, called canard, to explain anticipation in excitable systems. We provide a numerical approach, which allows to determine the transient effects of canards. To demonstrate the general validity of canard-mediated anticipation in the context of excitable systems, we illustrate our framework in two examples, a multi-scale radio-wave circuit (the van der Pol model) that inspired a caricature neuronal model (the FitzHugh-Nagumo model) and a biophysical neuronal model (a 2-dimensional reduction of the Hodgkin-Huxley model), where canards act as messengers to the senders' prediction. We also propose an experimental paradigm that would enable experimental neuroscientists to validate our predictions. We conclude with an outlook to possible fascinating research avenues to further unfold the mechanisms underpinning anticipation. We envisage that our approach can be employed by a wider class of excitable systems with appropriate theoretical extensions.","['1 MathNeuro Team, Inria Sophia Antipolis Méditerranée, 06902 Sophia Antipolis, France.', '2 Instituto de Física Interdisciplinar y Sistemas Complejos IFISC (CSIC-UIB), Universitat de les Illes Baleares, Campus UIB, E-07122 Palma de Mallorca, Spain.', '3 IKERBASQUE: The Basque Foundation for Science 48013 Bilbao, Basque Country, Spain.']","Elif Köksal Ersöz, Mathieu Desroches, Claudio R Mirasso, Serafim Rodrigues, ","Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)",2019 Jan,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30709107

990,Defining the ionic mechanisms of optogenetic control of vascular tone by channelrhodopsin-2,"Background and purpose:
      
    

    
      Optogenetic control of electromechanical coupling in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) is emerging as a powerful research tool with potential applications in drug discovery and therapeutics. However, the precise ionic mechanisms involved in this control remain unclear. Experimental approach:
      
    

    
      Cell imaging, patch-clamp electrophysiology and muscle tension recordings were used to define these mechanisms over a wide range of light stimulations. Key results:
      
    

    
      Transgenic mice expressing a channelrhodopsin-2 variant [ChR2(H134R)] selectively in VSMCs were generated. Isolated VSMCs obtained from these mice demonstrated blue light-induced depolarizing whole-cell currents. Fine control of artery tone was attained by varying the intensity of the light stimulus. This arterial response was sufficient to overcome the endogenous, melanopsin-mediated, light-evoked, arterial relaxation observed in the presence of contractile agonists. Ca2+ entry through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, and opening of plasmalemmal depolarizing channels (TMEM16A and TRPM) and intracellular IP3 receptors were involved in the ChR2(H134R)-dependent arterial response to blue light at intensities lower than ~0.1 mW·mm-2 . Light stimuli of greater intensity evoked a significant Ca2+ influx directly through ChR2(H134R) and produced marked intracellular alkalinization of VSMCs. Conclusions and implications:
      
    

    
      We identified the range of light intensity allowing optical control of arterial tone, primarily by means of endogenous channels and without substantial alteration to intracellular pH. Within this range, mice expressing ChR2(H134R) in VSMCs are a powerful experimental model for achieving accurate and tuneable optical voltage-clamp of VSMCs and finely graded control of arterial tone, offering new approaches to the discovery of vasorelaxant drugs.","['1 Department of Pharmacology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', '2 OXION Initiative in Ion Channels and Disease, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', '3 Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.']","Nils J G Rorsman, Chau M Ta, Hannah Garnett, Pawel Swietach, Paolo Tammaro, ",British journal of pharmacology,2018 Jun,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29486056
991,Accuracy and precision of electrical permittivity mapping at 3T: the impact of three [Formula: see text] mapping techniques,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      To investigate the sequence-specific impact of B 1 +  amplitude mapping on the accuracy and precision of permittivity reconstruction at 3T in the pelvic region. Methods:
      
B 1 +  maps obtained with actual flip angle imaging (AFI), Bloch-Siegert (BS), and dual refocusing echo acquisition mode (DREAM) sequences, set to a clinically feasible scan time of 5 minutes, were compared in terms of accuracy and precision with electromagnetic and Bloch simulations and MR measurements. Permittivity maps were reconstructed based on these B 1 +  maps with Helmholtz-based electrical properties tomography. Accuracy and precision in permittivity were assessed. A 2-compartment phantom with properties and size similar to the human pelvis was used for both simulations and measurements. Measurements were also performed on a female volunteer's pelvis. Results:
      
    

    
      Accuracy was evaluated with noiseless simulations on the phantom. The maximum B 1 +  bias relative to the true B 1 +  distribution was 1% for AFI and BS and 6% to 15% for DREAM. This caused an average permittivity bias relative to the true permittivity of 7% to 20% for AFI and BS and 12% to 35% for DREAM. Precision was assessed in MR experiments. The lowest standard deviation in permittivity, found in the phantom for BS, measured 22.4 relative units and corresponded to a standard deviation in B 1 +  of 0.2% of the B 1 +  average value. As regards B 1 +  precision, in vivo and phantom measurements were comparable. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our simulation framework quantitatively predicts the different impact of B 1 +  mapping techniques on permittivity reconstruction and shows high sensitivity of permittivity reconstructions to sequence-specific bias and noise perturbation in the B 1 +  map. These findings are supported by the experimental results.","['1 Department of Radiotherapy, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', '2 Center for Image Sciences, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', '3 Department of Radiation Oncology, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']","Soraya Gavazzi, Cornelis A T van den Berg, Alessandro Sbrizzi, H Petra Kok, Lukas J A Stalpers, Jan J W Lagendijk, Hans Crezee, Astrid L H M W van Lier, ",Magnetic resonance in medicine,2019 Jun,B1 mapping; Helmholtz-based EPT; accuracy and precision; permittivity mapping.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30737816

993,Investigation of AAA dose calculation algorithm accuracy in surface and buildup region for 6MV photon beam using markus parallel-plate ion chamber,"In radiotherapy, dose distributions are obtained by using dose calculation algorithms that are implanted in treatment planning systems (TPS). This study aims to compare the surface doses of separate field sizes calculated by different version of The Analytical Anisotropic Algorithm (AAA) and measured by the parallel-plate ion chamber that is admitted as the most reliable dosimetry system for the surface region dose measurements. In order to measure the near surface dose, water equivalent solid phantom was used and measurements were made for 6MV photon beam at 100 cm source-detector distance for 5×5, 10×10, and 20×20 cm2 field sizes. AAA 8.9 and AAA 15.1 versions of the Varian Eclipse TPS were used for surface dose calculations by generating beams with separate field sizes. The doses were read by considering the effective buildup thickness of Markus parallel-plate ion chamber. The surface doses using 6 MV photon beams for 10×10 cm2 field size at 0.07 mm were found to be 11.04%, 26.25%, and 19.69% for AAA v8.9, AAA v15.1 and Markus chamber, respectively. It was seen that for both of the AAA versions and Markus parallel-plate ion chamber, increasing field sizes also increase surface dose. For all field sizes, surface dose was lowest by using AAA v8.9 at 0.07 mm. The different versions of the same TPS algorithms may calculate the surface doses distinctively. After upgrading of TPS algorithms, surface doses should be calculated and compared by measurements with different dosimetry systems to better understand their calculation behaviors in the near surface region.","['1 Division of Medical Physics, Istanbul University Oncology Institute, Istanbul, Turkey.']","Nazmiye Donmez Kesen, Ugur Akbas, Canan Koksal, Hatice Bilge, ",Journal of X-ray science and technology,2019,AAA dose algorithm; Markus parallel plate ion chamber; buildup region; surface dose.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30856153

Calculated doses with both algorithms agreed with the measurement data to within the following criteria recommended for conventional therapeutic MV beams: 2% local dose-difference in the high-dose region, 3% global difference in the low-dose region, 3 mm distance to agreement in the penumbra, and a gamma pass rate of >95% for 3%/3 mm criteria. Acuros was able to accurately calculate dose through cork and bone-equivalent heterogeneities. AAA was able to accurately calculate dose through the bone-equivalent heterogeneity but did not pass within the recommended criteria for the cork heterogeneity.

      We aimed to develop a method for evaluating developmental changes in the synchronized activity of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neurons without extrinsic signals from feeder astrocytes. Methods:
      
    

    
      Microelectrode arrays (MEAs) and microtunnels were fabricated with photolithography and soft lithography. hiPSCs were induced to differentiate into cortical neurons, and seeded to conventional and microtunnel MEAs. Spontaneous activity was recorded every ten days, and spiking and bursting activities were elucidated. Results:
      
    

    
      First, hiPSC-derived neurons were cultured on conventional MEAs. They formed aggregates and subsequently detached from the culture substrate. Hence, no MEAs showed spontaneous synchronized activity beyond 300 days post-induction. Next, we applied a microtunnel structure designed to keep the axons on the array. Synchronized activity was then recorded from all microtunnel MEAs by 450 days post-induction. The proportion of electrodes showing neural activity was greater than that in conventional MEAs. The activity pattern reached a steady state after approximately 330 days, which may be the maturation time of the human neuronal network. Conclusion:

In this review, key quantitative methods for AF analysis are described, and suggestions are provided for the coordination of the available information, and to develop foci and directions for future research efforts. Quantitative biologists may have an interest in this topic in order to develop machine learning and tools for arrhythmia characterization, but they may perhaps have a minimal background in the clinical methodology and in the types of observed events and mechanistic hypotheses that have thus far been developed. We attempt to address these issues via exploration of the published literature. Although no new data is presented in this review, examples are shown of current lines of investigation, and in particular, how electrogram analysis and whole-chamber quantitative modeling of the left atrium may be useful to characterize fibrillatory patterns of activity, so as to propose avenues for more efficacious acquisition and interpretation of AF data.","['1 Department of Medicine - Division of Cardiology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA; ElectroCardioMaths Programme, Imperial Centre for Cardiac Engineering, Imperial College London, London, UK.

We further demonstrate the capabilities of this system to validate the direct link between these two modalities of voltage recordings.","['1 Myocardial Function Section, National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, 4th floor Imperial Centre for Translational and Experimental Medicine, Hammersmith Campus, Du Cane Road, London, W12 0NN, UK. r.chowdhury@imperial.ac.uk.', '2 ElectroCardioMaths Programme, Imperial Centre for Cardiac Engineering, Imperial College London, London, UK. r.chowdhury@imperial.ac.uk.', '3 Myocardial Function Section, National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, 4th floor Imperial Centre for Translational and Experimental Medicine, Hammersmith Campus, Du Cane Road, London, W12 0NN, UK.', '4 ElectroCardioMaths Programme, Imperial Centre for Cardiac Engineering, Imperial College London, London, UK.', '5 Department of Aeronautics, Imperial College London, South Kensington Campus, London, SW7 2AZ, UK. c.cantwell@imperial.ac.uk.', '6 ElectroCardioMaths Programme, Imperial Centre for Cardiac Engineering, Imperial College London, London, UK. c.cantwell@imperial.ac.uk.', '7 Department of Cardiothoracic Transplantation & Mechanical Circulatory Support, Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust, London, UB9 6JH, UK.']","Rasheda A Chowdhury, Konstantinos N Tzortzis, Emmanuel Dupont, Shaun Selvadurai, Filippo Perbellini, Chris D Cantwell, Fu Siong Ng, Andre R Simon, Cesare M Terracciano, Nicholas S Peters, ",Scientific reports,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29720607
1003,Digital-resolution detection of microRNA with single-base selectivity by photonic resonator absorption microscopy,"Circulating exosomal microRNA (miR) represents a new class of blood-based biomarkers for cancer liquid biopsy. The detection of miR at a very low concentration and with single-base discrimination without the need for sophisticated equipment, large volumes, or elaborate sample processing is a challenge. To address this, we present an approach that is highly specific for a target miR sequence and has the ability to provide ""digital"" resolution of individual target molecules with high signal-to-noise ratio. Gold nanoparticle tags are prepared with thermodynamically optimized nucleic acid toehold probes that, when binding to a target miR sequence, displace a probe-protecting oligonucleotide and reveal a capture sequence that is used to selectively pull down the target-probe-nanoparticle complex to a photonic crystal (PC) biosensor surface. By matching the surface plasmon-resonant wavelength of the nanoparticle tag to the resonant wavelength of the PC nanostructure, the reflected light intensity from the PC is dramatically and locally quenched by the presence of each individual nanoparticle, enabling a form of biosensor microscopy that we call Photonic Resonator Absorption Microscopy (PRAM). Dynamic PRAM imaging of nanoparticle tag capture enables direct 100-aM limit of detection and single-base mismatch selectivity in a 2-h kinetic discrimination assay. The PRAM assay demonstrates that ultrasensitivity (<1 pM) and high selectivity can be achieved on a direct readout diagnostic.","['1 Institute for Genomic Biology, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL 61801.', '2 Holonyak Micro and Nanotechnology Laboratory, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL 61801.', '3 Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL 61801.', '4 Department of Bioengineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL 61801.', '5 Department of Chemistry, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL 61801.', '6 Department of Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905.', '7 Department of Genitourinary Oncology, H.

1005,Nanophotonic Cell Lysis and Polymerase Chain Reaction with Gravity-Driven Cell Enrichment for Rapid Detection of Pathogens,"Rapid and precise detection of pathogens is a critical step in the prevention and identification of emergencies related to health and biosafety as well as the clinical management of community-acquired urinary tract infections or sexually transmitted diseases. However, a conventional culture-based pathogen diagnostic method is time-consuming, permitting physicians to use antibiotics without ample clinical data. Here, we present a nanophotonic Light-driven Integrated cell lysis and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on a chip with Gravity-driven cell enrichment Health Technology (LIGHT) for rapid precision detection of pathogens (<20 min). We created the LIGHT, which has the three functions of (1) selective enrichment of pathogens, (2) photothermal cell lysis, and (3) photonic PCR on a chip. We designed the gravity-driven cell enrichment via a nanoporous membrane on a chip that allows an effective bacterial enrichment of 40 000-fold from a 1 mL sample in 2 min. We established a light-driven photothermal lysis of preconcentrated bacteria within 1 min by designing the network of nanoplasmonic optical antenna on a chip for ultrafast light-to-heat conversion, created the nanoplasmonic optical antenna network-based ultrafast photonic PCR on a chip, and identified Escherichia coli. Finally, we demonstrated the end-point detection of up to 103 CFU/mL of E. coli in 10 min. We believe that our nanophotonic LIGHT will provide rapid and precise identification of pathogens in both developing and developed countries.","['1 Department of Bioengineering , University of California , Berkeley , California 94720 , United States.', '2 UC Berkeley and UCSF Joint Graduate Program in Bioengineering , University of California , Berkeley , California 94720 , United States.', '3 Berkeley Sensor and Actuator Center , University of California , Berkeley , California 94720 , United States.', '4 Division of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology, School of Public Health , University of California , Berkeley , California 94720 , United States.', '5 Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science , University of California , Berkeley , California 94720 , United States.', '6 Biophysics Graduate Program , University of California , Berkeley , California 94720 , United States.', '7 Biomedical Institute for Global Health Research and Technology (BIGHEART), Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine and Faculty of Engineering , National University of Singapore , Singapore 119077.']","Byungrae Cho, Sang Hun Lee, Jihwan Song, Saptati Bhattacharjee, Jeffrey Feng, SoonGweon Hong, Minsun Song, Wonseok Kim, Jonghwan Lee, Doyeon Bang, Bowen Wang, Lee W Riley, Luke P Lee, ",ACS nano,2019,lab-on-a-chip; molecular diagnostics; photothermal lysis; plasmonics; rapid photonic PCR; sample enrichment; urinary tract infection (UTI).,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31756079
1006,Recording single- and multi-unit neuronal action potentials from the surface of the dorsal root ganglion,"The dorsal root ganglia (DRG) contain cell bodies of primary afferent neurons, which are frequently studied by recording extracellularly with penetrating microelectrodes inserted into the DRG. We aimed to isolate single- and multi-unit activity from primary afferents in the lumbar DRG using non-penetrating electrode arrays and to characterize the relationship of that activity with limb position and movement. The left sixth and seventh lumbar DRG (L6-L7) were instrumented with penetrating and non-penetrating electrode arrays to record neural activity during passive hindlimb movement in 7 anesthetized cats. We found that the non-penetrating arrays could record both multi-unit and well-isolated single-unit activity from the surface of the DRG, although with smaller signal to noise ratios (SNRs) compared to penetrating electrodes. Across all recorded units, the median SNR was 1.1 for non-penetrating electrodes and 1.6 for penetrating electrodes. Although the non-penetrating arrays were not anchored to the DRG or surrounding tissues, the spike amplitudes did not change (<1% change from baseline spike amplitude) when the limb was moved passively over a limited range of motion (~20 degrees at the hip). Units of various sensory fiber types were recorded, with 20% of units identified as primary muscle spindles, 37% as secondary muscle spindles, and 24% as cutaneous afferents. Our study suggests that non-penetrating electrode arrays can record modulated single- and multi-unit neural activity of various sensory fiber types from the DRG surface.","['1 Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', '2 Department of Bioengineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', '3 Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', '4 Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.', '5 Biointerfaces Institute, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.', '6 Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States of America. dougweber@pitt.edu.', '7 Department of Bioengineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States of America. dougweber@pitt.edu.', '8 Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States of America. dougweber@pitt.edu.']","Ahmed I Kashkoush, Robert A Gaunt, Lee E Fisher, Tim M Bruns, Douglas J Weber, ",Scientific reports,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30808921

1008,Effects of pre-treatments on bulk stable isotope ratios in fish samples: A cautionary note for studies comparisons,"Rationale:
      
    

    
      Stable isotope analysis (SIA) has revolutionised ecological studies over the past thirty years. One of the major fields where SIA is applied in the marine environment is related to the definition of ecosystem structure and function. With marine top predators such as sharks, SIA is a method of choice because tissue samples can be collected without the sacrifice of the animal. In elasmobranch research, the influence of compounds such as urea, trimethylamine oxide and lipids must be considered when using stable isotopes as ecological markers. Currently, a range of pre-treatments are used to chemically remove these molecules prior to SIA. Methods:
      
    

    
      This study investigated the impact of eleven commonly used pre-treatments on carbon and nitrogen contents and C:N atomic ratio, as well as carbon and nitrogen SI ratios in elasmobranch tissues and its prey, measured by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. Three tissues were tested: blood and muscle of the ragged-tooth shark Carcharias taurus, and muscle of one teleost species, the Cape knifejaw Oplegnathus conwayi. Results:
      
    

    
      Compared with untreated samples, no trend or generalisation could be highlighted with the influence of pre-treatments being species-, tissue- and chemical-element-dependent. For the δ13 C and δ15 N values, differences among pre-treatments were as high as 3‰, therefore potentially leading to erroneous ecological interpretation. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The chemical properties of compounds (e.g. urea, lipids) combined with the polarity of solutions (e.g. water, solvents) explained a large part of these observations. This study highlights that pre-treatments need to be considered especially when comparing carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios between studies. The results of this study provide a call to all stable isotope researchers to make a concerted effort to standardise pre-treatment methods. This is crucial as global reviews are becoming increasingly more informative.","['1 Institute for Coastal and Marine Research, Marine Apex Predator Research Unit, Department of Zoology, Nelson Mandela University, PO Box 77000, Port Elizabeth, 6031, South Africa.', '2 UP Stable Isotope Laboratory, Mammal Research Institute, University of Pretoria, Private Bag X20, Hatfield, 0028, South Africa.', '3 Port Elizabeth Museum, PO Box 13147 Humewood, Port Elizabeth, 6013, South Africa.']","Maëlle Connan, Grant Hall, Malcolm Smale, ",Rapid communications in mass spectrometry : RCM,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30414205

We employ a new approach for the accurate STED measurement of the hitherto unmeasured degree of hexadecapolar transition dipole moment alignment α40 present at a given excitation-depletion (pump-dump) pulse separation. Time-resolved polarized fluorescence measurements as a function of pump-dump delay reveal the time evolution of α40 to be considerably more rapid than predicted for isotropic rotational diffusion in EGFP. Additional depolarization by homo-Förster resonance energy transfer is investigated for both α20 (quadrupolar) and α40 transition dipole alignments.

The mechanochemical make-up of this polymer network regulates growth, morphogenesis, and stability at the cell and tissue scales. To understand the dynamics of cell wall mechanics, and how it correlates with cellular activities, several experimental frameworks have been deployed in recent years to quantify the mechanical properties of plant cells and tissues. Here we critically review the application of biomechanical tool sets pertinent to plant cell mechanics and outline some of their findings, relevance, and limitations. We also discuss methods that are less explored but hold great potential for the field, including multiscale in silico mechanical modeling that will enable a unified understanding of the mechanical behavior across the scales. Our overview reveals significant differences between the results of different mechanical testing techniques on plant material. Specifically, indentation techniques seem to consistently report lower values compared with tensile tests. Such differences may in part be due to inherent differences among the technical approaches and consequently the wall properties that they measure, and partly due to differences between experimental conditions.","['1 Department of Plant Science, McGill University, Macdonald Campus, Lakeshore, Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue, Québec, Canada.', '2 Institut de recherche en biologie végétale, Département de sciences biologiques, Université de Montréal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']","Amir J Bidhendi, Anja Geitmann, ",Journal of experimental botany,2019,Acoustic microscopy; fracture; indentation; mechanical modeling; microfluidics; morphogenesis; multiscale models; plant cell mechanics; primary cell wall; tension test.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31301141

Although significant advances have been made in developing nanodevices for intracellular probes, current approaches exhibit a trade-off between device scalability and recording amplitude. We address this challenge by combining deterministic shape-controlled nanowire transfer with spatially defined semiconductor-to-metal transformation to realize scalable nanowire field-effect transistor probe arrays with controllable tip geometry and sensor size, which enable recording of up to 100 mV intracellular action potentials from primary neurons. Systematic studies on neurons and cardiomyocytes show that controlling device curvature and sensor size is critical for achieving high-amplitude intracellular recordings.

1017,Hybrid Microdrive System with Recoverable Opto-Silicon Probe and Tetrode for Dual-Site High Density Recording in Freely Moving Mice,"Multi-regional neural recordings can provide crucial information to understanding fine-timescale interactions between multiple brain regions. However, conventional microdrive designs often only allow use of one type of electrode to record from single or multiple regions, limiting the yield of single-unit or depth profile recordings. It also often limits the ability to combine electrode recordings with optogenetic tools to target pathway and/or cell type specific activity. Presented here is a hybrid microdrive array for freely moving mice to optimize yield and a description of its fabrication and reuse of the microdrive array. The current design employs nine tetrodes and one opto-silicon probe implanted in two different brain areas simultaneously in freely moving mice. The tetrodes and the opto-silicon probe are independently adjustable along the dorsoventral axis in the brain to maximize the yield of unit and oscillatory activities. This microdrive array also incorporates a set-up for light, mediating optogenetic manipulation to investigate the regional- or cell type-specific responses and functions of long-range neural circuits. In addition, the opto-silicon probe can be safely recovered and reused after each experiment. Because the microdrive array consists of 3D-printed parts, the design of microdrives can be easily modified to accommodate various settings. First described is the design of the microdrive array and how to attach the optical fiber to a silicon probe for optogenetics experiments, followed by fabrication of the tetrode bundle and implantation of the array into a mouse brain. The recording of local field potentials and unit spiking combined with optogenetic stimulation also demonstrate feasibility of the microdrive array system in freely moving mice.","['1 Department of Psychiatry, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.', '2 Department of Psychiatry, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center; Department of Neuroscience, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.', '3 Department of Psychiatry, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center; Jun.Yamamoto@utsouthwestern.edu.']","Hisayuki Osanai, Takashi Kitamura, Jun Yamamoto, ",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31449259
1018,Spatial scales of living cells and their energetic and informational capacity,"Physical (thermodynamic and kinetic), chemical, and biological reasoning restrict the spatial dimensions of living cells (prokaryotic and eukaryotic) and confine them to between 1 and 100 µm. Cells should necessarily be macroscopic, dissipative objects, resisting thermal fluctuations and providing sufficient informational capacity. The upper limit of the spatial dimensions of cells is supplied by their ability to withstand gravity and inertia forces under reasonable deformations. The upper limit of cell dimensions is also governed by the hierarchy of characteristic time scales, inherent for mass and heat transport. For micron-scaled cells, the ""traffic time"" (namely a typical time necessary for the migration of one enzyme to another) is on the order of magnitude of a millisecond, which coincides with the characteristic time scale of a single round of the catalytic enzyme cycle. The macroscopic dimensions of living cells (seen as dissipative systems) and the hierarchy of time scales of the mass transfer processes vs. those inherent for heat transport and viscous dissipation give rise to the irreversibility of biological processes.","['1 Department of Chemical Engineering, Biotechnology and Materials, Engineering Faculty, Ariel University, P.O.B. 3, 407000, Ariel, Israel. edward@ariel.ac.il.', '2 Tel-Aviv University, Ramat Aviv, 66978, Tel-Aviv, Israel.']","Edward Bormashenko, Alexander Voronel, ",European biophysics journal : EBJ,2018 Jul,Characteristic time of mass transport; Dissipative system; Informational capacity; Living cells; Spatial dimensions.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29204891

1024,Transition of the Field from Biochemical Engineering to Pharmaceutical Sciences during 40 Years of the Research,"This review reflects back over almost 40 years of the author's basic research conducted at Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Osaka University, Japan. After performing postdoctoral research in USA, the author became a research associate at Prof. Yoshiharu Miura's lab and started research on Biochemical Engineering in 1984. At that time, the main research purpose was to solve global environmental issues for maintaining human health. The author's achievements included novel useful material production system under inorganic conditions and genetically engineered whole-cell bacterial sensors detecting arsenite by naked eye without a detecting device. Another theme in the lab was to construct bioartificial liver support system. Various scaffolds for hepatocytes were newly prepared for constructing the compact reactor. Besides the bioreactor study, the author conducted cell transplantation research for the treatment of chronic liver diseases. It was shown that mesenchymal stem cells derived from third molars (wisdom teeth) could differentiate into hepatocytes and exhibit therapeutic effects in liver-damaged animals. After 2006, the lab started research on drug delivery systems, including noninvasive delivery of drugs such as peptides and nucleic acids by regulating epithelial tight junctions. Many substances enabling drug delivery through ""paracellular"" route were newly prepared. The author started basic research on Biochemical Engineering in the 1970s. Although these studies eventually shifted into the pharmaceutical field, the underlying concept was based on ""engineering"" throughout a 40-year research period. The author cordially thanks all colleagues for supporting engineering research in our lab.","['1 Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Osaka University.']","Kiyohito Yagi, ",Yakugaku zasshi : Journal of the Pharmaceutical Society of Japan,2019,bioartificial liver; biochemical engineering; biodegradable polymer; cell transplantation; drug delivery system; whole-cell biosensor.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30713241
1025,The Medial Canthus Reference Electrode Is not Electrically Indifferent to the Ocular Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potential,"Objective:
      
    

    
      To determine whether a reference electrode placed over the contralateral medical canthus is electrically indifferent to the ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potential (oVEMP). Study design:
      
    

    
      Prospective observational study. Setting:
      
    

    
      Tertiary academic center. Participants:
      
    

    
      Nineteen otologically normal subjects. Methods:
      
    

    
      oVEMPs were recorded using a 500 Hz tone burst at 125 dB pSPL using both a conventional dual infra-orbital derivation and contralateral infraorbital electrode referenced to a medial canthus electrode known as the ""belly-tendon"" derivation. Results:
      
    

    
      The belly-tendon derivation produced significantly larger oVEMP amplitudes. This appears to be due to a polarity inversion of the first negative peak that occurs when the reference electrode is placed over the medial canthus. Thus, the belly-tendon derivation was associated with reference contamination, but in this instance the reference contamination produced an augmented oVEMP amplitude. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Neither the dual infra-orbital nor belly-tendon electrode montages are electrically neutral. Reference contamination is the source of both a decrease in amplitude using conventional recording techniques and increased amplitude using the belly-tendon montage. The results support the contention that the belly-tendon montage generates a reversed polarity response, i.e., algebraically subtracted (i.e., added in the differential amplifier) from the response recorded at the infraorbital midline enhancing the oVEMP amplitude. It should be noted that the amplitude gained when using the belly-tendon montage may also be due to electromyographic (EMG) generated by extraocular muscles other than the inferior oblique generator, resulting in a loss of specificity. The authors recommend the belly-tendon montage be used in clinical situations where the oVEMP is absent or low in amplitude.","['1 Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders, James Madison University, Harrisonburg, Virginia.', '2 Department of Hearing and Speech Sciences, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.']","Erin G Piker, Gary P Jacobson, Kathryn F Makowiec, Paris M Atabek, Sara Krolewicz, ","Otology & neurotology : official publication of the American Otological Society, American Neurotology Society [and] European Academy of Otology and Neurotology",2018 Dec,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30212429
1026,Gel-based proteomics in disease research: Is it still valuable?,"Gel electrophoresis had been the primary method in proteomics. In the early era of proteomics, gel electrophoresis was a dominant technique of sample preparation for mass spectrometry analysis. Particularly, two-dimensional electrophoresis provided high-resolution proteome separation, and was regarded as the standard methodology for the separation of wide-range proteomes. However, gel electrophoresis turned downwards due to the progress of other separations including liquid chromatography and ionization techniques, resulting gel-free proteomics finally becoming dominant players at present. There are numerous advantages in gel-free approach in aspects of current trends of disease research. Interestingly, gel-free approaches are still advanced, it seems that gel electrophoresis will not be disappeared. The unique features of gel electrophoresis can be complementary for gel-free and it is suitable for the new wave of top-down functional proteomics.","['1 Department of Biochemistry, BK21 PLUS Program for Creative Veterinary Science Research and Research Institute for Veterinary Science, College of Veterinary Medicine, Seoul National University, 1 Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul 08826, Republic of Korea; Center for Bioanalysis, Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science, 267 Gajeong-ro, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon 43113, Republic of Korea.', '2 Department of Biochemistry, BK21 PLUS Program for Creative Veterinary Science Research and Research Institute for Veterinary Science, College of Veterinary Medicine, Seoul National University, 1 Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul 08826, Republic of Korea.

1027,Solving the general inter-ring distances optimization problem for concentric ring electrodes to improve Laplacian estimation,"Background:
      
    

    
      Superiority of noninvasive tripolar concentric ring electrodes over conventional disc electrodes in accuracy of surface Laplacian estimation has been demonstrated in a range of electrophysiological measurement applications. Recently, a general approach to Laplacian estimation for an (n + 1)-polar electrode with n rings using the (4n + 1)-point method has been proposed and used to introduce novel multipolar and variable inter-ring distances electrode configurations. While only linearly increasing and linearly decreasing inter-ring distances have been considered previously, this paper defines and solves the general inter-ring distances optimization problem for the (4n + 1)-point method. Results:
      
    

    
      General inter-ring distances optimization problem is solved for tripolar (n = 2) and quadripolar (n = 3) concentric ring electrode configurations through minimizing the truncation error of Laplacian estimation. For tripolar configuration with middle ring radius αr and outer ring radius r the optimal range of values for α was determined to be 0 < α ≤ 0.22 while for quadripolar configuration with an additional middle ring with radius βr the optimal range of values for α and β was determined by inequalities 0 < α < β < 1 and αβ ≤ 0.21. Finite element method modeling and full factorial analysis of variance were used to confirm statistical significance of Laplacian estimation accuracy improvement due to optimization of inter-ring distances (p < 0.0001). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Obtained results suggest the potential of using optimization of inter-ring distances to improve the accuracy of surface Laplacian estimation via concentric ring electrodes. Identical approach can be applied to solving corresponding inter-ring distances optimization problems for electrode configurations with higher numbers of concentric rings. Solutions of the proposed inter-ring distances optimization problem define the class of the optimized inter-ring distances electrode designs. These designs may result in improved noninvasive sensors for measurement systems that use concentric ring electrodes to acquire electrical signals such as from the brain, intestines, heart or uterus for diagnostic purposes.","['1 Department of Mathematics, Diné College, 1 Circle Dr, Tsaile, AZ, 86556, USA. omakeyev@dinecollege.edu.']","Oleksandr Makeyev, ",Biomedical engineering online,2018,Concentric ring electrodes; Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology; Finite element method; Inter-ring distances; Laplacian; Modeling; Optimization; Wearable sensors.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30165898

1032,Greetings from foodland: Teaching biochemistry to BS students in food-related courses in Italy,"Biochemistry has always been a mandatory topic within BS courses aimed at food science students at the University of Milan, namely: Food Science & Technology and Catering Sciences. Addressing biochemistry topics in this peculiar setting requires: (i) specific focus on topics that are seldom considered in courses offered in bio-medical curricula; (ii) close integration with other area disciplines, such as food biotechnology; (iii) ad hoc design of laboratory classes; and (iv) an array of elective courses covering specific aspects of biochemistry. In this context, for example, protein chemistry is presented by using food proteins of known structure and discussed in terms of structural features in the raw materials and of structural and chemical modifications occurring upon processing. Along the same lines, metabolic pathways and their regulation are presented starting from widespread metabolism-related issues and to issues related to food safety (including food allergies and intolerances). A similar ""hands on"" approach is used for laboratory classes, that cover about one third of total credits and are aimed at providing fundamental-type information by analyzing practical situations in the food chain. In spite of their inherent complexity and volume, biochemistry courses score very well with the students in mandatory anonymous surveys. Our approach to biochemistry courses seems to help the students in ""visualizing"" the practical implications of concepts acquired in other courses within their curricula. The students' appreciation is confirmed by the sizeable attendance to elective and specialized biochemical-themed courses. © 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 47(4):394-403, 2019.","['1 Department of Food, Environmental, and Nutritional Sciences (DeFENS), University of Milan, Milan, Italy.']","Stefania Iametti, Alberto Barbiroli, Mauro Marengo, Francesco Bonomi, ",Biochemistry and molecular biology education : a bimonthly publication of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,2019 Jul,BS students; food and catering sciences and technology; food quality and safety; structural changes upon processing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30985970
1033,Investigating the self-study phase of an inverted biochemistry classroom - collaborative dyadic learning makes the difference,"Background:
      
    

    
      The inverted classroom approach is characterized by a primary self-study phase for students followed by an on-site, face-to-face teaching phase that is used to deepen the prior acquired knowledge. Obviously, this teaching approach relies on the students preparing before the on-site phase, which in turn requires optimized preparatory material as well as defined working instructions. The major aim of this study, therefore, was to investigate the effect of different preparatory materials and working instructions for the self-study phase of an e-learning-based inverted classroom on the knowledge gained by medical students in biochemistry. Furthermore, we analyzed whether collaborative dyadic learning during the self-study phase is more effective than individual learning with respect to knowledge gain. Methods:
      
    

    
      The study was performed in a biochemistry seminar for second semester medical students at Ulm University in Germany. This seminar was held using an e-learning-based inverted classroom. A total of 196 students were divided into three homogeneous study groups that differed in terms of the working material and instructions provided for the self-study phase. Knowledge gain was measured by formative tests at the beginning of the on-site phases. Questionnaires were also handed out asking about motivation, interest and learning time in the self-study phases. Results:
      
    

    
      Students who were told to prepare in collaborating dyads during the self-study phase performed better in formative tests taken at the beginning of on-site phases than learners who were told to prepare individually. The study material that was provided was of minor importance for the differences in formative testing since almost all students prepared for the on-site phases. With the dyadic learning approach, both students benefited from this collaboration, characterized by a higher motivation and interest in the topic, as well as a longer time spent on task. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Our study provides strong evidence that the study material, but more importantly the instructions provided for the self-study phase, affect students` knowledge gain in an e-learning-based inverted classroom. The instructed collaboratively working group was the most successful.","['1 Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Ulm University, Albert-Einstein-Allee 11, 89081, Ulm, Germany. susanne.kuehl@uni-ulm.de.', '2 Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Ulm University, Albert-Einstein-Allee 11, 89081, Ulm, Germany.', '3 Office of the Dean of Studies, Medical Faculty, Ulm University, 89081, Ulm, Germany.', '4 Institute of Medical Systems Biology, Ulm University, 89081, Ulm, Germany.', '5 Institute for Medical Education, University Hospital, LMU Munich, 80336, Munich, Germany.']","Susanne J Kühl, Achim Schneider, Hans A Kestler, Matthias Toberer, Michael Kühl, Martin R Fischer, ",BMC medical education,2019,Biochemistry; Collaborative learning; Flipped classroom; Inverted classroom; Medical course of studies; Self-study phase.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30819178
1034,Cook Your Samples: The Application of Microwave Irradiation in Speeding Up Biological Processes,"Classic and conventional procedures in molecular cloning are inherent compositions in modern molecular biological experiments and are frequently involved in daily laboratory activities. They take up the majority of the total time input in spite of the availability of well-designed specialized commercial kits. A similar situation is also in the field of biotechnology. Fortunately, microwave/ultrasonic irradiation has been found to be capable of speeding up these processes, such as proteolysis in sample preparation for proteomics research, and digestion, ligation, (de)phosphorylation of DNA with the corresponding enzymes, even the introduction of DNA samples to recipient cells, and biotransformation (e.g., the production of biodiesel). Microwave/ultrasonic irradiation, when used solely or in combination with other existing operations, makes it possible to finish these time-consuming processes in as short as 1 min with comparable or even improved efficiency, and there is no need of reagent upgradation. The adoption of irradiation is ideal because it eliminates any possible side effects of the chemicals used as performance enhancer(s) that will inevitably make the system more complicated at least. More notably, the needed irradiation in the laboratory can be generated by a common microwave oven or ultrasonic cleaner. Taken together, microwave/ultrasonic irradiation provides an accessible method to make the procedures mentioned above time- and cost- efficient. In this article, we reviewed the relevant literature and discussed the experiment and mechanism details.","['1 College of Life Sciences, and Institute for Conservation and Utilization of Agro-bioresources in Dabie Mountains, Xinyang Normal University, Xinyang, 464000, China.', '2 College of Life Sciences, and Institute for Conservation and Utilization of Agro-bioresources in Dabie Mountains, Xinyang Normal University, Xinyang, 464000, China. tianwenw@gmail.com.']","Chen Liang, Ziwei Liu, Chaoping Liu, Yimeng Li, Hongyu Yuan, Tianwen Wang, ",Molecular biotechnology,2018 Mar,Biotransformation; Efficiency enhancement; Microwave irradiation; Molecular cloning; Sample preparation; Structure flexibility.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29396747
1035,mineXpert: Biological Mass Spectrometry Data Visualization and Mining with Full JavaScript Ability,"Biological mass spectrometry mainly comprises three fields of endeavor, namely, proteomics, metabolomics, and structural biology. In each of these specialties, the mass spectrometrist needs to access MS1 mass spectral data, although not necessarily on the same basis. For example, the bottom-up proteomics scientist will occasionally access MS1 data to perform data inspection, quality assessments, and quantitation measurements, whereas top-down proteomics, structural biology, or metabolomics scientists will actually spend most of their time mining profile-mode MS1 data. Furthermore, the advent of ion mobility-mass spectrometry imposes new manners of mass spectral data visualization. An open-source MS1-only mass data visualization software for the desktop was developed to allow scientists to visualize conventional and drift time mass data. Various mass data integrations are possible, allowing a thorough mass spectral data scrutiny. Isotopic cluster calculations are easily carried over from the chemical formula up to the display of the mass spectrum. Deconvolution of mass peaks can be achieved with a simple mouse drag. Flexible reporting of data inspection events and of mining discoveries is provided. Very large sparse data sets can be sliced into smaller chunks replicating the original data without data loss. Task automation is achieved in a JavaScript environment. This project allows users of mass spectrometry facilities to inspect and mine their MS1 mass data outside of these facilities without having to resort to the closed-source vendor software shipped with the instruments. mineXpert requires no proprietary software whatsoever once the mass spectrometry data have been converted to mzML.

1036,Teaching metabolism with scientific articles: A new approach,"Scientific articles have been explored as a didactic resource in the teaching of Biochemistry, as well as in other areas of science. This teaching strategy contributes to the learning and understanding of specific concepts, and development of the skills, necessary for the research training of students. The present study investigated the use of scientific articles in the Topics in Metabolism course, which was offered to Biochemistry graduate students, at the University of São Paulo. Instead of lectures and seminars, two main activities were used: directed study (DS) and discussion groups (DG). Both utilized and explored high impact publications with a recognized quality of intellectual production. In this active learning environment, the objective was to evaluate the perception of the students regarding the teaching strategy, and the level of effort each student expended to understand the course material. Data collection involved using the responses to open and closed questions, from two questionnaires. Then the Pirouette software was employed to perform the Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA). The results indicated that 78% of the students had a positive perception of the teaching strategy and struggled less to understand the course material. On the other hand, 22% of the students had a less positive perception of the strategy and displayed a less intense course engagement. Ultimately, the results presented in the present study indicate that the adoption of this teaching strategy can help graduate students to develop the ability to read critically and thoroughly understand scientific materials, which are fundamental skills for future researchers. © 2018 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 47(1):85-92, 2018.","['1 Universidade Federal do Pampa, Dom Pedrito, Brazil.', '2 Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil.', '3 Department of Biochemistry, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.']","Camila Cicuto, Maurícius Pazinato, Bayardo Torres, ",Biochemistry and molecular biology education : a bimonthly publication of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,2019 Jan,Metabolism; active learning methods; didactic resources; scientific articles.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30475433

High-sensitivity and low-cost pressure sensors are the primary requirement in practical application. Herein, a convenient and low-cost process to fabricate a bionic fish-scale structure poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) film via air/water interfacial formation technique is presented. High-sensitivity flexible pressure sensors can be constructed by assembling conductive films of graphene nanosheets into a microstructured film. Thanks to the unique fish-scale structures of PDMS films, the prepared pressure sensor shows excellent performance with high sensitivity (-70.86% kPa-1). In addition, our pressure sensors can detect weak signals, such as wrist pulses, respiration, and voice vibrations. Moreover, the whole process of pressure sensor preparation is cost-effective, eco-friendly, and controllable. The results indicate that the prepared pressure sensor has a profitable and efficient advantage in future applications for monitoring human physiological signals and sensing subtle touch, which may broaden its potential applications in wearable devices.","['1 Center for Material Design Science, School of Integrated Design Engineering , Keio University , 3-14-1 Hiyoshi , Yokohama 223-8522 , Japan.']","Jian Wang, Mizuki Tenjimbayashi, Yuki Tokura, Jun-Yong Park, Koki Kawase, Jiatu Li, Seimei Shiratori, ",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2018,air/water; e-skin; graphene nanoplatelet; pressure sensor; wearable devices.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30003780

Herein, a quantitative chemical proteomic workflow for stoichiometric analysis of ubiquitination is reported, named isotopically balanced quantification of ubiquitination (IBAQ-Ub). The strategy utilizes a new amine-reactive chemical tag (AcGG-NHS) that is structurally homologous to the GG remnant of ubiquitin on modified lysine after trypsin cleavage and therefore enables the generation of structurally identical peptides from ubiquitinated and unmodified lysine residues following trypsin digestion and secondary stable isotopic labeling. The strategy is highly robust, sensitive, and accurate with a wide dynamic range using either protein standards or complex cell lysates. Thus, this work provides an efficient chemical proteomics tool for quantitative stoichiometric analysis of ubiquitination signaling pathways.","['1 Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Biophysics, University of Minnesota at Twin Cities, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, USA.']","Yunan Li, Jonathan Evers, Ang Luo, Luke Erber, Zachary Postler, Yue Chen, ",Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2019,IBAQ-Ub; proteasome inhibition; quantitative proteomics; stoichiometry; ubiquitination.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30444082
1039,Integrative hepatic metabolomics and proteomics reveal insights into the mechanism of different feed efficiency with high or low dietary forage levels in Holstein heifers,"Feed efficiency (FE) can be affected by dietary composition, management, and metabolic conditions. The liver is the central metabolic organ in cattle; however, specific metabolic changes in the liver under different dietary forage levels have not been clarified. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the hepatic physiology mechanisms of high or low dietary forage levels (80% or 20% forage, namely S80 and S20) on FE in dairy heifers using integrative metabolomic and proteomic methods. Feed efficiency was lower in the S80 group than the S20 group. A total of 29 metabolites and 60 proteins were significantly different between the liver samples of the two groups. Fourteen selected proteins were analyzed using parallel reaction monitoring to confirm the reliability of proteomic analysis. Integrative functional analysis of differentially expressed metabolites/proteins confirmed the enhanced hepatic ability of fatty acid oxidation, amino acid metabolism, pentose phosphate pathway, gluconeogenesis, ketone bodies synthesis, and oxidative stress defense in the S80 heifers. These metabolic pathways are associated with FE in ruminants. Thus, our results suggested that the aforementioned metabolic pathways may be responsible for the reduced FE in heifers fed high levels of forage. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Improving the efficiency of animal production is a continuously urgent mission of all agricultural producers. Limit-feeding high concentrate diets to heifers is considered as an effective way to improve feed efficiency in heifers' raising, which can not only decrease the feeding and management cost but also relieve some environmental problems. However, the detailed metabolic and physiological changes and mechanisms associated with this strategy remain to be further characterized even some transcriptomics and microbiology work have been done. For extending the knowledge towards this strategy, an integrative metabolomic and proteomic method was used to investigate the hepatic physiology mechanisms of high or low dietary forage levels on feed efficiency in dairy heifers. Enhanced hepatic ability of fatty acid oxidation, amino acid metabolism, pentose phosphate pathway, gluconeogenesis, ketone bodies synthesis, and oxidative stress defense were found in high forage consumed heifers, which were all related to energy utilization in ruminants and might be responsible for the reduced feed efficiency. Understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating the hepatic metabolism in high or low forage fed heifers may help to design alternative feeding or management strategies that improve feed efficiency.","['1 State Key Laboratory of Animal Nutrition, Beijing Engineering Technology Research Center of Raw Milk Quality and Safety Control, College of Animal Science and Technology, China Agricultural University, Beijing, PR China.', '2 State Key Laboratory of Animal Nutrition, Beijing Engineering Technology Research Center of Raw Milk Quality and Safety Control, College of Animal Science and Technology, China Agricultural University, Beijing, PR China; College of Life Science and Technology, Southwest Minzu University, Chengdu, Sichuan, 610041，PR China.', '3 State Key Laboratory of Animal Nutrition, Beijing Engineering Technology Research Center of Raw Milk Quality and Safety Control, College of Animal Science and Technology, China Agricultural University, Beijing, PR China.

However, the classical GC- or HPLC-based methods for amino acid quantification do not meet the needs for multiplexed stable isotope-enriched analysis by ultrahigh-resolution Fourier transform mass spectrometry (UHR-FTMS). This is due to insufficient acquisition time during chromatographic separations and large dynamic range in concentrations of analytes, which compromises detection and quantification of the numerous metabolite isotopologues present in crude extracts.

1046,The physiological variability of channel density in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells and interneurons explored using a unified data-driven modeling workflow,"Every neuron is part of a network, exerting its function by transforming multiple spatiotemporal synaptic input patterns into a single spiking output. This function is specified by the particular shape and passive electrical properties of the neuronal membrane, and the composition and spatial distribution of ion channels across its processes. For a variety of physiological or pathological reasons, the intrinsic input/output function may change during a neuron's lifetime. This process results in high variability in the peak specific conductance of ion channels in individual neurons. The mechanisms responsible for this variability are not well understood, although there are clear indications from experiments and modeling that degeneracy and correlation among multiple channels may be involved. Here, we studied this issue in biophysical models of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons and interneurons. Using a unified data-driven simulation workflow and starting from a set of experimental recordings and morphological reconstructions obtained from rats, we built and analyzed several ensembles of morphologically and biophysically accurate single cell models with intrinsic electrophysiological properties consistent with experimental findings. The results suggest that the set of conductances expressed in any given hippocampal neuron may be considered as belonging to two groups: one subset is responsible for the major characteristics of the firing behavior in each population and the other is responsible for a robust degeneracy. Analysis of the model neurons suggests several experimentally testable predictions related to the combination and relative proportion of the different conductances that should be expressed on the membrane of different types of neurons for them to fulfill their role in the hippocampus circuitry.","['1 Institute of Biophysics, National Research Council, Palermo, Italy.', '2 Blue Brain Project, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Campus Biotech, Geneva, Switzerland.', '3 University College London, London, United Kingdom.', '4 University of Westminster, London, United Kingdom.', '5 Laboratory of Neural Microcircuitry (LNMC), Brain Mind Institute, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland.', '6 Institute of Experimental Medicine, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Budapest, Hungary.', '7 Faculty of Information Technology and Bionics, Pázmány Péter Catholic University, Budapest, Hungary.']","Rosanna Migliore, Carmen A Lupascu, Luca L Bologna, Armando Romani, Jean-Denis Courcol, Stefano Antonel, Werner A H Van Geit, Alex M Thomson, Audrey Mercer, Sigrun Lange, Joanne Falck, Christian A Rössert, Ying Shi, Olivier Hagens, Maurizio Pezzoli, Tamas F Freund, Szabolcs Kali, Eilif B Muller, Felix Schürmann, Henry Markram, Michele Migliore, ",PLoS computational biology,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30222740

By using clickers only in a small-group tutorial element of a large theoretical course, we observed an improvement in exam scores that resulted in a lower failure rate for the course. Furthermore, students of all abilities were found to benefit from their use. Students reported better retention of both lecture and tutorial content. An analysis of how clickers were employed within the tutorials indicated that the use of clickers to promote discussion and impart knowledge likely resulted in a moderate improvement of exam scores. We hypothesize that students were more prepared for exams through greater reflection of exam questions, resulting in an enhanced ability to retrieve memorized information and apply it within a time-limited exam setting.","['1 CNRS Univ.

Pattern electroretinograms (PERG) can be used to examine retinal ganglia cells and visual evoked potentials (VEP) help to investigate overall visual pathways. Thus, they support objective functional tests of visual pathways, as well as differential diagnosis. Conventional electrophysiology is of limited value in detecting local defects in the visual field. This gap is filled by applications of multifocal electrophysiology. This permits spatially resolved testing with multifocal PERG (mfPERG) and multifocal VEP (mfVEP), and eventually objective visual field testing with mfVEP. It is important for this spectrum of methods to consider possible confounds when performing the measurements and when interpreting the results. This is explained in the present article on the basis of a series of typical examples.","['1 Klinik für Augenheilkunde, Universität Magdeburg, Magdeburg.', '2 Center for Behavioral Brain Sciences, Magdeburg.', '3 Klinik für Augenheilkunde, Universitätsklinikum Freiburg, Medizinische Fakultät, Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg, Freiburg.']","Michael B Hoffmann, Sven P Heinrich, Hagen Thieme, Khaldoon O Al-Nosairy, ",Klinische Monatsblatter fur Augenheilkunde,2018 Nov,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30458562

The BW-DLW method was compared to the DLW based on blood plasma. Mice (n = 11, 43.5 ± 4.6 g body mass (BM)) were administered orally a single bolus of doubly labelled water (1.2 g H218O kg BM-1 and 0.4 g 2H2O kg BM-1, 99 atom% (AP) 18O or 2H). To sample breath water, the mice were placed into a respiration vessel. The exhaled water vapour was condensed in a cold-trap. The isotope enrichments of breath water were compared with plasma samples. The 2H/1H and 18O/16O isotope ratios were measured by means of isotope ratio mass spectrometry. The CO2 production (RCO2) was calculated from the 2H and 18O enrichments in breath water and plasma over 5 days. The isotope enrichments of breath water vs. plasma were correlated (R2 = 0.89 for 2H and 0.95 for 18O) linearly. The RCO2 determined based on breath water and plasma was not different (113.2 ± 12.7 vs. 111.4 ± 11.0 mmol d-1), respectively. In conclusion, the novel BW-DLW method is appropriate to obtain reliable estimates of RCO2 avoiding blood sampling.","[""1 a Institute of Nutritional Physiology 'Oskar Kellner', Leibniz Institute for Farm Animal Biology (FBN) , Dummerstorf , Germany."", '2 b Institute of Genetics and Biometry, Leibniz Institute for Farm Animal Biology (FBN) , Dummerstorf , Germany.']","Peter Junghans, Solvig Görs, Martina Langhammer, Cornelia C Metges, ",Isotopes in environmental and health studies,2018 Dec,Energy expenditure; doubly labelled water; hydrogen-2; in vivo measurements; mice; oxygen-18; stable isotope tracer techniques.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30318924

      It is important to deliver acid-base balance concepts in the context of multiple physiological systems and metabolic processes that influence acid-base homeostasis. This activity combines the interactions of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and renal systems in conjunction with basic metabolism to generate an integrated activity for first-year medical students. Methods:
      
    

    
      We developed four concise case scenarios around various presentations of acid-base disturbance along with five sets of arterial blood gases (ABGs) and five different metabolic lab panels. M1 students were given class time to match the three different types of data in order to address how the underlying biochemistry and physiology of a scenario translated into ABG and metabolic laboratory values. Results:
      
    

    
      Although not statistically significant, the students' performance on acid-base questions was marginally higher than on standardized National Board of Medical Examiners questions on other topics covered in the same exam, and the improvement over national average scores on the same questions increased. Student evaluation of the activity was positive, with general appreciation of its application and integration of concepts. Discussion:
      
    

    
      The incorporation of this activity into the M1 year was positively received and enhanced integration of content related to acid-base balance. The activity is flexible and can be adapted to most any curricular structure, with the potential to include additional content depending on the level of the learner.","['1 Associate Professor, Department of Basic Science Education, Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine; Chair, Department of Basic Science Education, Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine.', '2 Associate Professor, Department of Basic Science Education, Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine; Director of Faculty Development, Department of Basic Science Education, Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine.']","Renée J LeClair, Andrew P Binks, ",MedEdPORTAL : the journal of teaching and learning resources,2019,Acid; Arteriole; Base; Bicarbonate; Metabolism; Workshop.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30800993
1059,A Physiolomics Approach to Reveal Systemic Organ Dynamics in a Rodent,"The central nervous system controls the activity states of the peripheral organs in response to various environmental changes. However, the physiological interactions across multiple organs remain largely unknown. Recently, we have developed an electrophysiological recording system that simultaneously captures neuronal population activity patterns in the brain, heartbeat signals, muscle contraction signals, respiratory signals, and vagus nerve action potentials in freely moving rodents. This paper summarizes several recent insights obtained from this recording system, including the observations that some but not all brain activity patterns are associated with peripheral organ activity in a behavioral test, and that functions across cortical networks can predict stress-induced changes in cardiac function in rats. The evidence suggests that adding information on peripheral physiological signals to behavioral data assists in a more accurate estimation of animals' mental states. The concept of such a research approach opens a new field of large-scale analysis of systemic physiological signals, termed ""physiolomics,"" which is expected to unveil further physiological issues involving mind-body associations in health and disease.","['1 Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, The University of Tokyo.', '2 Precursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technology (PRESTO), Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST).']","Takuya Sasaki, ",Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,2019,behavior; central–peripheral association; heart rate; local field potential.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31257279
1060,Effect of trailing-edge serrations on noise reduction in a coupled bionic aerofoil inspired by barn owls,"Noise reduction is an important development direction for aircrafts and wind turbines. Owl wings have three unique morphological characteristics (leading-edge serrations, trailing-edge serrations and velvet-like surfaces) that effectively suppress aerodynamic noise in low Reynolds numbers. Among them, trailing-edge serrations are widely considered the most effective noise-reduction method. Although different serrations have been studied, the quantitative relationship and influence mechanism between the serration shape, wavelength and amplitude are poorly understood. The acoustic characteristics of asymmetrical aerofoils with different trailing-edge serrations have not been fully studied. This work investigates the flow characteristics and acoustic scattering mechanisms of novel owl-based aerofoils with different trailing-edge serrations. A sensitivity analysis is utilized to quantitatively investigate the influence and interaction mechanisms of the shape, wavelength and amplitude in trailing-edge noise reduction. Numerical simulations of the transient flow over the aerofoil are performed via the large eddy simulation method, and the acoustic far-field is obtained by solving the Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings equation. The results indicate that the sawtooth and sinusoidal serrations provide the most significant noise reduction effects; the maximum noise reduction is 8.74 dB. The wavelength and amplitude play similar roles, but the amplitude has relatively greater influence. For the sawtooth and sinusoidal serrations, the large-scale vortex structures are broken into many small-scale spiral vortex structures due to the presence of the sharp serration tip. The serrations can effectively reduce the coherence of the turbulent fluctuations due to spanwise variations in the edge and may be the main reason for noise suppression. The original owl-based aerofoil generates more low-frequency noise and less high-frequency noise than aerofoils with trailing-edge serrations. The peak noise frequencies of all aerofoils are approximately 400 Hz; hence, low-frequency noise is a dominant influence in noise generation. Furthermore, the acoustic sources generated by transient pressure fluctuations are mainly located on the serration root.","[""1 School of Energy and Power Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, People's Republic of China.""]","Dian Li, Xiaomin Liu, Fujia Hu, Lei Wang, ",Bioinspiration & biomimetics,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31665715

One particularly notable feature is the ability for users to define original mathematical equations for representing unknown kinetic mechanisms and customize them as GUI components for representing reaction steps. Many simulators support System Biology Markup Language SBML; however, since the definition of the algebraic equations (AssignmentRule) and the events are made through an interface that is distinct from the definition of the reaction steps, there are tough works to define them. Accordingly, we have developed a new version of WinBEST-KIT that allows users to define the algebraic equations and the events through the same interface as those used in the definition of the reaction steps and customize them as GUI components appearing in the symbol selection area. The customized algebraic equations and events can thus be visually arranged at any time and any place. It also allows users to easily understand the roles of the algebraic equations and the events. We have also implemented other useful features, including importing/exporting of SBML format files, exporting to MATLAB, and merging the existing models into the model currently being created.

The newly proposed label-free HTS-RS platform combines automated imaging microscopy with Raman spectroscopy to enable a rapid label-free screening of cells and can be applied to a large number of biomedical and clinical applications. The potential of the new approach is illustrated by two applications. (1) HTS-RS-based differential white blood cell count. A classification model was trained using Raman spectra of 52 218 lymphocytes, 48 220 neutrophils, and 7 294 monocytes from four volunteers. The model was applied to determine a WBC differential for two volunteers and three patients, producing comparable results between HTS-RS and machine counting. (2) HTS-RS-based identification of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in 1:1, 1:9, and 1:99 mixtures of Panc1 cells and leukocytes yielded ratios of 55:45, 10:90, and 3:97, respectively.

1064,Advanced liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry enables merging widely targeted metabolomics and proteomics,"Either widely targeted metabolomics or quantitative proteomics usually requires unique analytical platform. However, cross-platform omics studies entail higher levels of complexity and uncertainty, and result in a significant obstacle for high throughput assay as well. It is thereby urgent to pursue an integrative approach being capable of merging these two omics terms, namely widely targeted bi-omics. As an eligible analytical tool for large-scale targeted metabolomics, reversed phase liquid chromatography-hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-tailored selected reaction monitoring (RPLC-HILIC-tailored SRM) was deployed here to further receive the tryptic peptides as the analytes. Comparative evaluation of metabolites and tryptic peptides, 101 ones in total, between HepG2 and SK-Hep1 cells was conducted as a proof-of-concept. All analytes, regardless of metabolites or peptides, exhibited satisfactory chromatographic behaviors on RPLC-HILIC. Quantitative MS parameters, such as SRM transitions and collision energies (CEs), of either tryptic peptides or metabolites were online optimized in a standard compound-independent manner. It was worthwhile to mention that the signal responses of the peptides-of-choice generated by the optimized CEs were significantly superior to those values suggested by Skyline software. Calibration curves of both metabolites and peptides were constructed by serially diluting a so-called universal metabolome standard (UMS) sample. The quasi-content of each peptide or metabolite was gained according to applying those regressive calibration curves. After subjecting the quasi-content dataset into SIMCA-P software, significant differences took place between the two hepatic cell lines, and not only metabolites but tryptic peptides contributed to the discrimination. Above all, RPLC-HILIC-tailored SRM offered a promising choice towards widely targeted bi-omics attributing to the advantage of simultaneous monitoring metabolites and tryptic peptides.","['1 Modern Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine, School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, 100029, China.', '2 State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Institute of Chinese Medical Sciences, University of Macau, Taipa, 999078, Macao.', '3 Modern Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine, School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, 100029, China.

Here, we provide a perspective on how these models can be applied to study the mechano-geometrical contributions to early mammalian development, which still escape direct verification in species that develop in utero. We thus outline new avenues for robust and scalable perturbation of geometry and mechanics in ways traditionally limited to non-implanting developmental models.","['1 Laboratory of Stem Cell Bioengineering, Institute of Bioengineering, School of Life Sciences (SV) and School of Engineering (STI), Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland.

1066,Cancer genetics meets biomolecular mechanism-bridging an age-old gulf,"Increasingly available genomic sequencing data are exploited to identify genes and variants contributing to diseases, particularly cancer. Traditionally, methods to find such variants have relied heavily on allele frequency and/or familial history, often neglecting to consider any mechanistic understanding of their functional consequences. Thus, while the set of known cancer-related genes has increased, for many, their mechanistic role in the disease is not completely understood. This issue highlights a wide gap between the disciplines of genetics, which largely aims to correlate genetic events with phenotype, and molecular biology, which ultimately aims at a mechanistic understanding of biological processes. Fortunately, new methods and several systematic studies have proved illuminating for many disease genes and variants by integrating sequencing with mechanistic data, including biomolecular structures and interactions. These have provided new interpretations for known mutations and suggested new disease-relevant variants and genes. Here, we review these approaches and discuss particular examples where these have had a profound impact on the understanding of human cancers.","['1 Bioquant, Heidelberg University, Germany.', '2 Heidelberg University Biochemistry Center (BZH), Germany.']","Juan Carlos González-Sánchez, Francesco Raimondi, Robert B Russell, ",FEBS letters,2018 Feb,bioinformatics; genetics; mechanism; protein interactions; protein structure.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29364530

1068,A role for phosphorus redox in emerging and modern biochemistry,"Phosphorus is a major biogeochemical element controlling growth in many ecosystems. It has presumably been an important element since the onset of life. In most chemical and biochemical considerations, phosphorus is synonymous with phosphates, a pentavalent oxidation state that includes the phosphate backbone of DNA and RNA, as well as major metabolites such as ATP. However, redox processing of phosphates to phosphites and phosphonates, and to even lower oxidation states provides a work-around to many of the problems of prebiotic chemistry, including phosphorus's low solubility and poor reactivity. In addition, modern phosphorus cycling has increasingly identified reduced P compounds as playing a role, sometimes significant, in biogeochemical processes. This suggests that phosphorus is not redox-insensitive and reduced P compounds should be considered as part of the phosphorus biogeochemical cycle.","['1 University of South Florida, School of Geosciences, 4202 E Fowler Ave, NES 204, Tampa, FL, 3360, USA.

1071,Comparison of electrophysiological properties of two types of pre-sympathetic neurons intermingled in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus,"The hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) contains two types of neurons projecting to either the rostral ventrolateral medulla (PVNRVLM) or the intermediolateral horn (IML) of the spinal cord (PVNIML). These two neuron groups are intermingled in the same subdivisions of the PVN and differentially regulate sympathetic outflow. However, electrophysiological evidence supporting such functional differences is largely lacking. Herein, we compared the electrophysiological properties of these neurons by using patch-clamp and retrograde-tracing techniques. Most neurons (＞70%) in both groups spontaneously fired in the cell-attached mode. When compared to the PVNIML neurons, the PVNRVLM neurons had a lower firing rate and a more irregular firing pattern (p ＜ 0.05). The PVNRVLM neurons showed smaller resting membrane potential, slower rise and decay times, and greater duration of spontaneous action potentials (p ＜ 0.05). The PVNRVLM neurons received greater inhibitory synaptic inputs (frequency, p ＜ 0.05) with a shorter rise time (p ＜ 0.05). Taken together, the results indicate that the two pre-sympathetic neurons differ in their intrinsic and extrinsic electrophysiological properties, which may explain the lower firing activity of the PVNRVLM neurons. The greater inhibitory synaptic inputs to the PVNRVLM neurons also imply that these neurons have more integrative roles in regulation of sympathetic activity.","['1 Department of Veterinary Pharmacology, College of Veterinary Medicine and Research Institute of Veterinary Science, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, Korea.', '2 Department of Oral Physiology, School of Dentistry and Institute of Oral Bioscience, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju 54896, Korea.']","Yiming Shen, Seong Kyu Han, Pan Dong Ryu, ",Journal of veterinary science,2018,action potential; inhibitory postsynaptic current; patch-clamp techniques; rostral ventrolateral medulla; spinal cord lateral horn.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29649859
1072,Probing the Relevance of Chemical Identity Thinking in Biochemical Contexts,"The solving of problems in biochemistry often uses concepts from multiple disciplines such as chemistry and biology. Chemical identity (CI) is a foundational concept in the field of chemistry, and the knowledge, thinking, and practices associated with CI are used to answer the following questions: ""What is this substance?"" and ""How is it different from other substances?"" In this study, we examined the relevance of CI in biochemical contexts and first explored the ways in which practicing biochemists consider CI relevant in their work. These responses informed the development of creative exercises (CEs) given to second--semester biochemistry students. Analysis of the student responses to these CEs revealed that students incorporated precursors to CI thinking in more than half of their responses, which were categorized by seven previously identified themes of CI relevant to the presented biochemical contexts. The prevalence of these precursors in student responses to the CEs, coupled with the examples provided by practicing biochemists of contexts in which CI is relevant, indicate that CI thinking is relevant for both students training to be biochemists and practicing biochemists.","['1 Department of Chemistry, University of Massachusetts Boston, Boston, MA 02125.', '2 The Institute for Learning and Teaching, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523-1052.']","Courtney Ngai, Hannah Sevian, ",CBE life sciences education,2018 Dec,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30417758
1073,Photophysical properties of the hemicyanine Dy-630 and its potential as a single-molecule fluorescent probe for biophysical applications,"Protein-induced fluorescence enhancement (PIFE) is an increasingly used approach to investigate DNA-protein interactions at the single molecule level. The optimal probe for this type of application is highly photostable, has a high absorption extinction coefficient, and has a moderate fluorescence quantum yield that increases significantly when the dye is in close proximity to a large macromolecule such as a protein. So far, the green-absorbing symmetric cyanine known as Cy3 has been the probe of choice in this field because the magnitude of the increase observed upon protein binding (usually 2-4 -fold) is large enough to allow for the analysis of protein dynamics on the inherently noisy single-molecule signals. Here, we report the characterization of the photophysical properties of the red-absorbing hemicyanine dye Dy-630 in the context of its potential application as a single-molecule PIFE probe. The behavior of Dy-630 in solution is similar to that of Cy3; the fluorescence quantum yield and lifetime of Dy-630 increase with increasing viscosity, and decrease with increasing temperature indicating the existence of an activated nonradiative process that depopulates the singlet state of the dye. As in the case of Cy3, the results of transient spectroscopy experiments are consistent with the formation of a photoisomer that reverts to the ground state thermally in the microsecond timescale. Unfortunately, experiments with DNA samples paint a more complex scenario. As in the case of Cy3, the fluorescence quantum yield of Dy-630 increases significantly when the dye interacts with the DNA bases, but in the case of Dy-630 attachment to DNA results in an already long fluorescence lifetime that does not provide a significant window for the protein-induced enhancement observed with Cy3. Although we show that Dy-630 may not be well-suited for PIFE, our results shed light on the optimal design principles for probes for PIFE applications.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Nikita Kumari, Monika A Ciuba, Marcia Levitus, ",Methods and applications in fluorescence,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31585443
1074,Inconsistencies in some common terms and notations in enzymology: Textbook examples and suggestions,"A number of terms have been defined and inconsistently used across various texts in enzymology which may attract the attention of undergraduate students and instructors. At some places, inconsistent use results in confusions as well as leads to the misuse of these terms. Although it is difficult to resolve such inconsistencies, attempts have constantly been made by international regulatory forums such as International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB) and other similar organizations to abolish the inconsistencies. This article highlights some of the most commonly occurring confusing and inconsistent terms in enzymology. We have gathered shreds of evidences and provide here possible suggestions and caution for readers and instructors, so that mistakes can be minimized and possible guidelines can be prepared for their usage. A few inconsistencies observed and discussed here include different notations of activation energy, differences in terms uncompetitive and noncompetitive in enzyme inhibition, classification of cofactors and definitions of their sub-types, and confusing usage of the enzyme-inhibitor dissociation constant.

1075,A course-based undergraduate research experience in biochemistry that is suitable for students with various levels of preparedness,"Due to resource limitations at predominantly undergraduate institutions, research opportunities for non-senior students can be limited. To provide opportunities for a variety of students to gain exposure to research, a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) was designed and conducted. Coupled inquiry was used to allow underclassmen and upperclassmen to participate. Students first utilized a bioinformatics approach to develop hypotheses concerning protein interactions with the receptor Mer tyrosine kinase (MERTK). Students designed experiments to identify specific sites of interactions with SH2-domain proteins utilizing an assortment of basic biochemical techniques. The semester culminated in students testing their hypotheses and producing manuscripts. Underclassmen that participated in the course also benefitted from mentor-mentee relationships developed with upperclassmen due to the collaborative nature of the course. The structure of the course also allows for further studies to be conducted based on novel findings and is highly adaptable to receptor tyrosine kinases found in other tissue types. © 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 47(3):220-227, 2019.","['1 Department of Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Physics, Florida Southern College, Lakeland, Florida 33801.']","Shameka J Shelby, ",Biochemistry and molecular biology education : a bimonthly publication of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,2019 May,Course-based undergraduate research experience; coupled inquiry; protein-protein interactions; undergraduate biochemistry.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30794348
1076,SDA: a semi-parametric differential abundance analysis method for metabolomics and proteomics data,"Background:
      
    

    
      Identifying differentially abundant features between different experimental groups is a common goal for many metabolomics and proteomics studies. However, analyzing data from mass spectrometry (MS) is difficult because the data may not be normally distributed and there is often a large fraction of zero values. Although several statistical methods have been proposed, they either require the data normality assumption or are inefficient. Results:
      
    

    
      We propose a new semi-parametric differential abundance analysis (SDA) method for metabolomics and proteomics data from MS. The method considers a two-part model, a logistic regression for the zero proportion and a semi-parametric log-linear model for the possibly non-normally distributed non-zero values, to characterize data from each feature. A kernel-smoothed likelihood method is developed to estimate model coefficients and a likelihood ratio test is constructed for differential abundant analysis. The method has been implemented into an R package, SDAMS, which is available at https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SDAMS.html . Conclusion:
      
    

    
      By introducing the two-part semi-parametric model, SDA is able to handle both non-normally distributed data and large fraction of zero values in a MS dataset. It also allows for adjustment of covariates. Simulations and real data analyses demonstrate that SDA outperforms existing methods.","['1 Department of Statistics, University of Kentucky, Lexington, 40536, USA.', '2 Markey Cancer Center, University of Kentucky, Lexington, 40536, USA.', '3 Center for Environmental and Systems Biochemistry, University of Kentucky, Lexington, 40536, USA.', '4 Department of Toxicology and Cancer Biology, University of Kentucky, Lexington, 40536, USA.', '5 Department of Medicine, University of Kentucky, Lexington, 40536, USA.', '6 Markey Cancer Center, University of Kentucky, Lexington, 40536, USA. chi.wang@uky.edu.', '7 Department of Biostatistics, University of Kentucky, Lexington, 40536, USA. chi.wang@uky.edu.', '8 Markey Cancer Center, University of Kentucky, Lexington, 40536, USA. lichenuky@uky.edu.', '9 Department of Biostatistics, University of Kentucky, Lexington, 40536, USA. lichenuky@uky.edu.']","Yuntong Li, Teresa W M Fan, Andrew N Lane, Woo-Young Kang, Susanne M Arnold, Arnold J Stromberg, Chi Wang, Li Chen, ",BMC bioinformatics,2019,Differential abundance analysis; Kernel smoothing; Metabolomics; Proteomics; Semi-parametric log-linear model.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31623550
1077,Flexible Nanopipettes for Minimally Invasive Intracellular Electrophysiology In Vivo,"Intracellular recordings in vivo remains the best technique to link single-neuron electrical properties to network function. Yet existing methods are limited in accuracy, throughput, and duration, primarily via washout, membrane damage, and movement-induced failure. Here, we introduce flexible quartz nanopipettes (inner diameters of 10-25 nm and spring constant of ∼0.08 N/m) as nanoscale analogs of traditional glass microelectrodes. Nanopipettes enable stable intracellular recordings (seal resistances of 500 to ∼800 MΩ, 5 to ∼10 cells/nanopipette, and duration of ∼1 hr) in anaesthetized and awake head-restrained mice, exhibit minimal diffusional flux, and facilitate precise recording and stimulation. When combined with quantum-dot labels and microprisms, nanopipettes enable two-photon targeted electrophysiology from both somata and dendrites, and even paired recordings from neighboring neurons, while permitting simultaneous population imaging across cortical layers. We demonstrate the versatility of this method by recording from parvalbumin-positive (Pv) interneurons while imaging seizure propagation, and we find that Pv depolarization block coincides with epileptic spread. Flexible nanopipettes present a simple method to procure stable intracellular recordings in vivo.","['1 Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA; Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA; NeuroTechnology Center, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA; Kavli Institute for Brain Science, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA.

1078,iCURE (iterative course-based undergraduate research experience): A case-study,"Several models suggest ways to expose undergraduates at minority serving institutions or institutions with limited research infrastructures to the iterative process of research. Apprentice-based research experiences allow students to work one-on-one with a research mentor in the hands-on discovery process, but with teaching being a priority for faculty at the aforementioned institutions, financial, spatial, and time limitations for research progress exist. Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) provide opportunities for a greater number of undergraduates to become familiar with the questions, techniques, and failure involved in research. However, designing projects that a group of students can complete in a semester can be challenging. Inclusive Research Education Communities are intended to promote retention in STEM courses for early college students but have limited benefit for upper-level courses. We sought to create an iterative CURE between fall semester BIOL3900 at the University of North Texas and spring semester CHE397 at Bethel University (Saint Paul, MN) to promote collaboration between unique learning communities. The research goal was to use a tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) transient expression system as a platform to test gene functions and to engineer valuable bioproducts in plant vegetative tissues.

1079,Spike-triggered average electrical stimuli as input filters for bionic vision-a perspective,"Bionic retinal implants are gaining acceptance in the treatment of blindness from degenerative diseases including retinitis pigmentosa and macular degeneration. Objective:
      
    

    
      A current obstacle to the improved performance of such implants is the difficulty of comparing the results of disparate experiments. Another obstacle is the current difficulty in selectively activating the many different retinal ganglion cell types that are used as separate pathways for visual information to the brain. Approach:
      
    

    
      To address these obstacles, we propose a modelling framework based on white noise stimulation and reverse correlation. In this perspective, we first outline early developments in visual retinal physiology leading up to the implementation of white noise stimuli and spike-triggered averaging. We then review recent efforts to adapt the white noise method for electrical stimulation of the retina and some of the nuances of this approach. Main results:
      
    

    
      Based on such white noise methods, we describe a modelling framework whereby the effect of any arbitrary electrical stimulus on a ganglion cell's neural code can be better understood. Significance:
      
    

    
      This framework should additionally disentangle the effects of stimulation on photoreceptor, bipolar cell and retinal ganglion cell-ultimately supporting selective stimulation of specific ganglion cell types for a more nuanced bionic retinal implant. Finally, we point to upcoming considerations in this rapidly developing domain of research.","['1 Institute for Ophthalmic Research, Eberhard Karls University, 72076 Tübingen, Germany.

However, data on the validity of the device are unavailable. Fluctuations of the center of pressure (COP) were measured in 24 healthy participants (age: 29 ± 5 (mean ± SD) years, 12 females) synchronously using the IBS, which was rigidly mounted on a Kistler platform. Four different bipedal conditions were examined: eyes open or closed on stable or soft surfaces. Time series were compared using congruity (CON, proportion of the measurement time during which values of both devices changed similarly in direction), whereas IBS-specific postural outcomes were correlated with traditional postural control outcomes of the Kistler force platform. The time-displacement curves showed similar shapes for CON (>0.9) for each of the four standing conditions without differences between male and female participants (P > 0.39). The path length results of both devices showed very high linear associations, explaining on average 92% (medio-lateral) or 96% (anterior-posterior) of the common variance. The Kistler path length of the anterior-posterior direction revealed nearly perfect linear associations with the stability index of the IBS (r2 > 0.99). The results of this study indicate that the IBS provides valid posturographic results. Since the medial-lateral and anterior-posterior trajectories of the IBS can be used to calculate COP fluctuations, comparisons between different measurement systems are possible.","['1 Department of Orthopedic and Trauma Surgery, Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle (Saale), Germany; Institute of Sport Science, Movement Science Group, Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle (Saale), Germany.

      Despite considerable research investment, moving from biomarker discovery to clinical application has presented unique challenges. We aimed to evaluate progress toward clinical application of a sample of molecular- and ""omics""-based diagnostic tests over a 10-year period. Methods:
      
    

    
      We used Scopus to locate studies, published before the December 31, 2016, citing 107 original-research articles published in 2006 that assessed the diagnostic value of a molecular- or ""omics""-based test. We identified diagnostic studies of the same test and disease and determined whether the article represented progress in the validation of the molecular test. We classified the types of progress: (a) clinical validation (measuring diagnostic accuracy in a series of patients similar to the population in which the test will be used in practice), (b) technical improvement, (c) extended diagnostic application (modification of the diagnostic question attended initially by the test), (d) economic evaluation, or (e) clinical use or implementation. Results:
      
    

    
      In the 10-year period analyzed, 4257 articles cited the 107 diagnostic studies; 118 (2.8%) were diagnostic studies of the same test, and of these papers, 25 (21.2%) did not constitute progress toward validation of the test for use in clinical practice (potential research waste).

Accurate detection of periods of bursting activity is thus an important aspect of characterising both spontaneous and evoked neuronal network activity.

1088,Electrical coupling and its channels,"As the physiology of synapses began to be explored in the 1950s, it became clear that electrical communication between neurons could not always be explained by chemical transmission. Instead, careful studies pointed to a direct intercellular pathway of current flow and to the anatomical structure that was (eventually) called the gap junction. The mechanism of intercellular current flow was simple compared with chemical transmission, but the consequences of electrical signaling in excitable tissues were not. With the recognition that channels were a means of passive ion movement across membranes, the character and behavior of gap junction channels came under scrutiny. It became evident that these gated channels mediated intercellular transfer of small molecules as well as atomic ions, thereby mediating chemical, as well as electrical, signaling. Members of the responsible protein family in vertebrates-connexins-were cloned and their channels studied by many of the increasingly biophysical techniques that were being applied to other channels. As described here, much of the evolution of the field, from electrical coupling to channel structure-function, has appeared in the pages of the Journal of General Physiology.","['1 Department of Pharmacology, Physiology, and Neuroscience, Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, Newark, NJ aharris@njms.rutgers.edu.']","Andrew L Harris, ",The Journal of general physiology,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30389716

1090,Peppy: A virtual reality environment for exploring the principles of polypeptide structure,"A key learning outcome for undergraduate biochemistry classes is a thorough understanding of the principles of protein structure. Traditional approaches to teaching this material, which include two-dimensional (2D) images on paper, physical molecular modeling kits, and projections of 3D structures into 2D, are unable to fully capture the dynamic 3D nature of proteins. We have built a virtual reality application, Peppy, aimed at facilitating teaching of the principles of protein secondary structure. Rather than attempt to model molecules with the same fidelity to the underlying physical chemistry as existing, research-oriented molecular modelling approaches, we took the more straightforward approach of harnessing the Unity video game physics engine. Indeed, the simplicity and limitations of our model are strengths in a teaching context, provoking questions and thus deeper understanding. Peppy allows exploration of the relative effects of hydrogen bonding (and electrostatic interactions more generally), backbone φ/ψ angles, basic chemical structure, and steric effects on a polypeptide structure in an accessible format that is novel, dynamic, and fun to use. Apart from describing the implementation and use of Peppy, we discuss the outcomes of deploying Peppy in undergraduate biochemistry courses.","['1 Games Art and Design, Norwich University of the Arts, Norwich, UK.', '2 School of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', '3 School of Biological Sciences, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.', '4 School of Chemical Sciences, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.']","David G Doak, Gareth S Denyer, Juliet A Gerrard, Joel P Mackay, Jane R Allison, ",Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society,2020 Jan,polypeptide; protein; secondary structure; teaching; undergraduate; virtual reality.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31622516
1091,Electrophysiological Assessment of Murine Atria with High-Resolution Optical Mapping,"Recent genome-wide association studies targeting atrial fibrillation (AF) have indicated a strong association between the genotype and electrophysiological phenotype in the atria. That encourages us to utilize a genetically-engineered mouse model to elucidate the mechanism of AF. However, it is difficult to evaluate the electrophysiological properties in murine atria due to their small size. This protocol describes the electrophysiological evaluation of atria using an optical mapping system with a high temporal and spatial resolution in Langendorff perfused murine hearts. The optical mapping system is assembled with dual high-speed complementary metal oxide semiconductor cameras and high magnification objective lenses, to detect the fluorescence of a voltage-sensitive dye and Ca2+ indicator. To focus on the assessment of murine atria, optical mapping is performed with an area of 2 mm × 2 mm or 10 mm x 10 mm, with a 100 × 100 resolution (20 µm/pixel or 100 µm/pixel) and sampling rate of up to 10 kHz (0.1 ms) at maximum. A 1-French size quadripolar electrode pacing catheter is placed into the right atrium through the superior vena cava avoiding any mechanical damage to the atrium, and pacing stimulation is delivered through the catheter. An electrophysiological study is performed with programmed stimulation including constant pacing, burst pacing, and up to triple extrastimuli pacing. Under a spontaneous or pacing rhythm, the optical mapping recorded the action potential duration, activation map, conduction velocity, and Ca2+ transient individually in the right and left atria. In addition, the programmed stimulation also determines the inducibility of atrial tachyarrhythmias. Precise activation mapping is performed to identify the propagation of the excitation in the atrium during an induced atrial tachyarrhythmia. Optical mapping with a specialized setting enables a thorough electrophysiological evaluation of the atrium in murine pathological models.","['1 Department of Bio-informational Pharmacology, Medical Research Institute, Tokyo Medical and Dental University.', '2 Department of Biofunctional Informatics, Tokyo Medical and Dental University; sasano.bi@tmd.ac.jp.']","Kensuke Ihara, Koji Sugiyama, Kentaro Takahashi, Masahiro Yamazoe, Tetsuo Sasano, Tetsushi Furukawa, ",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29553490
1092,Establishing and validating of an laboratory information system-based auto-verification system for biochemical test results in cancer patients,"Background:
      
    

    
      To establish and validate an laboratory information system (LIS)-based auto-verification (AV) system by using large amounts of biochemical test results in cancer patients. Methods:
      
    

    
      An algorithm of the AV process was designed for pre-analysis, analysis, and post-analysis. The limit range check was adjusted three times, while the delta check criteria were first replaced by the same patients' historical extremum results. AV rules of 51 biochemical test items were tested by using data of 121 123 samples (6 177 273 tests) in 2016 that were manually reviewed through the simulative i-Vertification software of Roche. The improved and optimal AV rules were programed into our LIS and validated by using 140 113 clinical specimens in 2018. Results:
      
    

    
      The AV passing rate for samples tested in our laboratory increased from 15.57% to the current overall passing rate of 49.70%. The passing rate of each item for rule 3 was between 71.16% and 99.91%. Different cancer groups had different passing rate, while the disease group of liver, gallbladder, and pancreas always had the lowest passing rate. A total of 9420 reports (6.72%) were not verified by AV but could be verified by MV in 2018, while there were no reports that were verified by AV but not by MV. The TAT of March 2018 decreased with increase in sample size compared with the same time in 2017. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      We have firstly established an LIS-based AV system and implemented it in actual clinical care for cancer patients.","['1 Department of Clinical Laboratory, National Cancer Center/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.']","Cuie Yan, Yujuan Zhang, Jia Li, Jia Gao, Chanjuan Cui, Chun Zhang, Guiyu Song, Mengyao Yu, Jianjun Mu, Feng Chen, Xiaohong Han, Wei Cui, ",Journal of clinical laboratory analysis,2019 Jun,auto-verification; biochemical test; cancer; historical extremum; laboratory information system.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30843281

1094,Nanomechanics and co-transcriptional folding of Spinach and Mango,"Recent advances in fluorogen-binding ""light-up"" RNA aptamers have enabled protein-free detection of RNA in cells. Detailed biophysical characterization of folding of G-Quadruplex (GQ)-based light-up aptamers such as Spinach, Mango and Corn is still lacking despite the potential implications on their folding and function. In this work we employ single-molecule fluorescence-force spectroscopy to examine mechanical responses of Spinach2, iMangoIII and MangoIV. Spinach2 unfolds in four discrete steps as force is increased to 7 pN and refolds in reciprocal steps upon force relaxation. In contrast, GQ-core unfolding in iMangoIII and MangoIV occurs in one discrete step at forces >10 pN and refolding occurred at lower forces showing hysteresis. Co-transcriptional folding using superhelicases shows reduced misfolding propensity and allowed a folding pathway different from refolding. Under physiologically relevant pico-Newton levels of force, these aptamers may unfold in vivo and subsequently misfold. Understanding of the dynamics of RNA aptamers will aid engineering of improved fluorogenic modules for cellular applications.","['1 Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, 61801, USA.', '2 Department of Biophysics and Biophysical Chemistry, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, 21205, USA.', '3 Department of Biophysics and Biophysical Chemistry, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, 21205, USA. tjha@jhu.edu.', '4 Department of Biophysics, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, 21218, USA. tjha@jhu.edu.', '5 Department of Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, 21218, USA. tjha@jhu.edu.', '6 Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Baltimore, MD, 21218, USA. tjha@jhu.edu.']","Jaba Mitra, Taekjip Ha, ",Nature communications,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31541108

A crucial driving force for such developments is the availability and integration of ""omics"" data (e.g., transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) which enable the reconstruction, extraction, and application of context-specific metabolic networks. In this chapter, we demonstrate a workflow to integrate gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based metabolomics data of tomato fruit pericarp (flesh) tissue, at five developmental stages, with a genome-scale reconstruction of tomato metabolism. This method allows for the extraction of context-specific networks reflecting changing activities of metabolic pathways throughout fruit development and maturation.","['1 Faculty of Biochemistry, Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel. na.toepfer@gmail.com.', '2 Mathematics and Computer Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL, USA.', '3 Computation Institute, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', '4 Faculty of Biochemistry, Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']","Nadine Töpfer, Samuel M D Seaver, Asaph Aharoni, ","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2018,Constraint-based optimization; Data integration; Flux balance analysis; Metabolomics; Plant metabolic network; Python programming language.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29761447

The early identification of the MTs in biological tissues could be important tool for the estimation of appropriate clinical therapy. Therefore, here we investigated the application of matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI MSI) together with immunohistochemical analyses (IHC) using MT-1/2 antibody for MT detection in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) biopsy specimens of human skin. Principal component analyses revealed differences in the peptide/protein profiles separating healthy skin from the carcinoma specimens. Statistically significant ion peaks at m/z 6038, 6300, 6676, and 7026 were more frequently detected in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and melanoma. Using IHC, we found that MT-1/2 was significantly higher in SCC and melanoma compared to healthy skin. Surprisingly, significantly low levels of MT-1/2 were found in BCC. On one side, the results indicate important role of MTs in melanoma occurrence and progression, as on the second side, there are hidden processes associated with MTs based on differences of the occurrence of the MS peaks, which could be associated with cycling of MTs isoforms.","['1 Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Mendel University in Brno, Brno, Czech Republic; Central European Institute of Technology, Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic.', '2 Department of Pathology, Kenézy Gyula County Hospital, Debrecen, Hungary.', '3 Department of Dermatology, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary.', '4 Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Mendel University in Brno, Brno, Czech Republic.', '5 Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Mendel University in Brno, Brno, Czech Republic; Central European Institute of Technology, Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic.

1098,Templated Assembly of Pore-forming Peptides in Lipid Membranes,"Pore-forming peptides are of interest due to their antimicrobial activity and ability to form gateways through lipid membranes. Chemical modification of these peptides makes it possible to arrange several peptide monomers into well-defined pore-forming structures using various templating strategies. These templated super-structures can exert antimicrobial activity at significantly lower total peptide concentration than their untemplated equivalents. In addition, the chemical moieties used for templating may be functionalized to interact specifically with targeted membranes such as those of pathogens or cancer cells. A range of molecular templates has been explored, including dimerization of pore-forming monomers, their covalent attachment to cyclodextrin, porphyrin or fullerene scaffolds as well as attachment of amino acid linkers or nucleic acid constructs to generate assemblies of 4 to 26 peptides or proteins. Compared to free peptide monomers, templated pore assemblies showed increased membrane affinity, prolonged open-state lifetimes of the pores and more frequent pore formation due to higher local concentration. These constructs are useful model systems for biophysical studies to understand porin and ion channel proteins and their mechanisms of insertion into lipid membranes. Recently designed DNA-templates are expanding the usefulness of templated pore assemblies beyond applications of cell killing and may include targeted drug delivery and accelerate the emerging field of single-molecule detection and characterization of biomolecules by nanopore-based resistive pulse sensing.","['1 Soft Matter Group, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leeds, Leeds, LS2 9JT, UK.', '2 The Kaiteki Institute, Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings, 1-1 Marunouchi 1-chome, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', '3 Department of Materials, ETH Zürich, 8093 Zürich, Switzerland;, Email: gusev@mat.ethz.ch.']","A P Unwin, P J Hine, I M Ward, M Fujita, E Tanaka, Andrei A Gusev, ",Chimia,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30814000

      Nowadays, transvenous lead extraction (TLE) is considered an essential technique in lead management strategy. Since 2011, a multidisciplinary approach was undertaken in our centre involving electrophysiologists, cardiac surgeons and anaesthesiologists to improve cross- unit cooperation and minimize complications and mortality. The present paper reports procedural outcomes and complications of our lead extraction experience. Methods:
      
    

    
      We retrospectively collected and analysed data from all consecutive patients undergoing cardiac implantable electronic device leads TLE at the IRCCS Centro Cardiologico Monzino between January 2011 and November 2017. Results:
      
    

    
      One-hundred fifty patients (111 males, 68 ± 13 years) underwent extraction procedures. The most common extraction indication were infections (86.7%) and TLE was carried out by laser-based approach in 88 (58.6%) patients, by mechanical dilating sheaths in 58 (38.7%) patients and by a combined approach (TLE + open surgical intervention) in 4 (2.7%) patients. Procedural success was obtained in 146 (97.3%) cases with only 3 (2.0%) major complications with 2 cases of structural injury with tamponade requiring emergent median sternotomy. Open surgery extraction was required in 4 patients, after an attempt to TLE, due to leads strict adhesion to cardiac or vascular structures, whereas in 5 (3.3%) cases, the treatment of choice was a combined approach consisting in transvenous leads extraction followed by planned surgery. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      TLE is a complex procedure that sometimes leads to fatal complications.

They are especially weak in understanding the relationships between metabolic pathways and their integration because these pathways are always taught one-by-one in class. In the past, various online resources have been developed to facilitate students' understanding toward energy metabolism. Although these learning materials enable students to understand individual metabolic pathway in a clearer manner, many of them fail to demonstrate the linkages between these pathways. The ""AG City"" is a self-learning tool which aims to arouse students' interest in exploring nucleotide metabolism. We have designed a metro map as a concept map to allow students to have an overview of different pathways as well as their integration. Major pathways are presented as railway lines in an easy-to-understand and interactive manner using navigation, animations, and narrations. Key molecules involved in the pathways are presented as ""railway stations"". Students can easily identify common ""railway stations"" presented in different pathways and link the concepts that they have learnt together.

1107,A new Michaelis-Menten equation valid everywhere multi-scale dynamics prevails,"The Michaelis-Menten reaction scheme is among the most influential models in the field of biochemistry, since it led to a very popular expression for the rate of an enzyme-catalysed reaction. After the realisation that this expression is valid in a limited region of the parameter space, two additional expressions were later introduced. The range of validity of these three expressions has been studied thoroughly, since the significance of a reliable rate is not based only on the accuracy of its predictive abilities but also on the physical insight that is acquired in the process of its construction. Here a new expression for the rate is introduced that is valid in practically the full parameter space and reduces to the expressions in the literature, when considering appropriate limits. The new expression is produced by employing algorithmic tools for asymptotic analysis, so that its construction is not hindered by the dimensional form and the complexity of the full model or by a wide parameter range of interest. These tools can be employed for the derivation of enzyme rate expressions of much more complex kinetics mechanisms.","['1 School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, National Technical University of Athens, Athens, 15780, Greece.', '2 Department of Mechanical Engineering, Khalifa University, Abu Dhabi,127788, United Arab Emirates.

The limitation to cultivate the majority of potential symbionts has hampered attempts to explore and exploit their natural products for further development toward medical applications. Metagenomics-guided approaches have enabled cloning of natural product biosynthesis genes from uncultured microbial symbionts. Subsequent activation of biosynthesis genes in easily culturable bacteria could lead to the sustainable production of rare sponge-derived compounds. In this chapter, we highlight metagenomic strategies to reveal natural product biosynthetic pathways in sponge metagenomes based on the calyculin and misakinolide polyketides.

1111,Biochemistry laboratory reports: Filling in the introduction and discussion,"Laboratory reports written in the style of a standard scientific article are commonly used to assess student learning in biochemistry laboratory courses. While most students can complete the Materials and Methods or Results sections successfully, many have difficulty with the Introduction and Discussion. They fail to place their data in a larger experimental context or to compare their results to those previously published. To address this issue in a laboratory course focusing on l-lactate dehydrogenase, a new exercise was introduced that was designed 1) to provide more background information about l-lactate dehydrogenase; 2) to give students additional experience in using PubMed and Web of Science to locate specific papers about l-lactate dehydrogenase; 3) to introduce the major bioinformatics databases at the National Center for Biological Information, ExPASy (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics), BRENDA (Braunschweig Enzyme Database), and the Protein Data Bank; 4) to allow students to recover detailed information about l-lactate dehydrogenases; and 5) to provide practice in reading a research article that is similar to what they do in the lab. The students completed a data sheet summarizing these activities and then prepared three laboratory reports. The lab reports improved over the course of the semester and were qualitatively better than in past years. The materials developed for this laboratory course can be adapted to similar projects that use another protein as a model system.

CP (0, 0.5 or 5 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally (i.p.) administered for single dose. Animals were sacrificed 2 days (D2) or 8 days (D8) after administration of CP in order to perform analysis of serum biochemistries and histopathologic examination. Urine samples were collected every 24 hr from pre-treatment to sacrifice. Serum and urinary 1H NMR spectral data revealed apparent differential clustering between control and CP-treated groups as evidenced by principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal projections to latent structures-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) in global and targeted profiling. The concentrations of endogenous serum metabolites, alanine, betaine, glucose, glutamine, lactate, and leucine were significantly increased on D2. Urinary concentrations of alanine, glucose, glycine, guanidinoacetate, acetate, and lactate were significantly elevated on D2 or D8, whereas concentrations of urinary metabolites, citrate and hippurate were significantly decreased on D2 or D8. The correlation of serum and urinary 1H NMR OPLS-DA with serum biochemistry and renal histopathologic changes suggests that 1H NMR urinalysis may be used to reliably predict or screen CP-induced nephrotoxicity. Data suggest that these altered endogenous metabolites might serve as specific biomarkers for CP-induced nephrotoxicity.","['1 R&D Center, GL Pharm Tech Corp., Korea.', '2 College of Pharmacy, Dankook University, Korea.', '3 College of Pharmacy, Sungkyunkwan University, Korea.', '4 Pharmacology Department, CKD Research Institute, Korea.', '5 Department of Chemistry, Center for Proteome Biophysics and Chemistry Institute for Functional Materials, Pusan National University, Korea.']","Sung Ha Ryu, Jung Dae Lee, Ji Won Kim, Siwon Kim, Suhkmann Kim, Kyu-Bong Kim, ",The Journal of toxicological sciences,2019,Biomarker; Cisplatin; Nephrotoxicity; Toxicometabolomics.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30626780
1113,"Gel electrophoresis-based plant proteomics: Past, present, and future. Happy 10th anniversary Journal of Proteomics!","In this century we have assisted at an unimaginable expansion of proteomics, with continuous innovations and optimizations in methods, techniques, protocols, equipment, and associated bioinformatics tools. We have moved forward very fast from first (gel electrophoresis based), to second (based on isotopic or isobaric labelling), to third (shotgun or gel-free, label-free), and to fourth (targeted, mass-western, or SRM/MRM) generation techniques. This evolution is clearly observed in the literature since 1994, when the term ""proteome"" was first coined, with plant proteomics progressing at a much lower speed than human and other model organisms. The question behind this review is: Is gel electrophoresis an obsolete technique? Is it still alive? The answer is that gel electrophoresis is still a valid technique, with its own particularities, strengths, and weaknesses, ""irreplaceable"" in top-down experiments directed at investigating protein species, loci and allelic variants, and isoforms, as well as in the post-translational modifications and interactions studies; it is an excellent complementary and alternative approach that could lead us to achieve a deeper visualization and knowledge of the cell proteome. The past, present, and future of this technique is being reviewed. It is not pretended to discuss in detail technical aspects, referring to key original papers or previous reviews, but instead, how it has contributed, from a historical perspective, to plant proteomics and biology research. It is our personal congratulations to ""Journal of Proteomics"" that celebrates this year its 10th anniversary, and, at the same time, a tribute to those scientists who have contributed to the establishment and development of the gel electrophoresis technique and its application to proteomics and plant biology research. Their direct or indirect teaching has been very valuable to those of us who once decided to enter proteomics, with no access to any sophisticated and expensive equipment. This gel electrophoresis-based plant proteomics review is divided into the following sections: introduction, history, methodology, contribution to plant biology research, and future directions.","['1 Agricultural and Plant Biochemistry, Proteomics, and Systems Biology Research Group, Dept. of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Córdoba, UCO-CeiA3, Córdoba, Spain.

However, there is so much more material here, which laid the foundation for a great deal of research in mathematical biochemistry in the intervening decades. The parameterization of the equations, construction of the first-order uniform singular-perturbation solution, and an attempt to apply similar principles to the pseudo-equilibrium approximation are discussed in particular detail.","['1 Alberta RNA Research and Training Institute, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Lethbridge, Lethbridge, Alberta, T1K 3M4, Canada.

1115,Is the triple stimulation technique a better quantification tool of motor dysfunction than motor evoked potentials in multiple sclerosis?,"The triple stimulation technique (TST) was rarely used in multiple sclerosis (MS). This study aimed to compare TST and motor evoked potentials (MEP) for the quantification of motor dysfunction. Central motor conduction based on MEP (four limbs) and TST (upper limbs) was assessed in 28 MS patients with a median Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) of 4. EDSS, timed 25-foot walk (T25FW), grasping strength and motor components of the MS functional composite were evaluated. Regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between MEP, TST and clinical findings. TST was negatively correlated with EDSS (r = - 0.74, p < 0.0001) and to a lesser extent with T25FW (r = - 0.47, p < 0.05), and grasping strength (r = - 0.43, p < 0.05). A multiple regression analysis underlined the better correlation between clinical data and TST (R2 = 0.56, p < 0.0005) than with MEP (0.03 < R2 < 0.22, p > 0.05). This study evidenced the value of TST as a quantification tool of motor dysfunction. TST appeared to reflect a global disability since it was correlated not only to hand function but also to walking capacity.","['1 Department of Neurology, University Hospital of Liege, Rue Grandfosse 31-33, 4130, Esneux, Belgium. xgiffroy@chuliege.be.', '2 Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, University Hospital of Liege, B35, 4000, Liège, Belgium. xgiffroy@chuliege.be.', '3 Department of Neurology, University Hospital of Liege, Rue Grandfosse 31-33, 4130, Esneux, Belgium.', '4 Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, University Hospital of Liege, B35, 4000, Liège, Belgium.', '5 Department of Biostatistics and Medico-Economic Information, University Hospital (CHU, ULg) of Liege, B35, 4000, Liège, Belgium.']","Xavier Giffroy, Dominique Dive, Jean-François Kaux, Nathalie Maes, Adelin Albert, Catherine Göbels, François Wang, ",Acta neurologica Belgica,2019 Mar,Axonopathy; Conduction failure; Disability; Motor evoked potentials; Multiple sclerosis; Triple stimulation technique.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30136146
1116,From plasmodesma geometry to effective symplasmic permeability through biophysical modelling,"Regulation of molecular transport via intercellular channels called plasmodesmata (PDs) is important for both coordinating developmental and environmental responses among neighbouring cells, and isolating (groups of) cells to execute distinct programs. Cell-to-cell mobility of fluorescent molecules and PD dimensions (measured from electron micrographs) are both used as methods to predict PD transport capacity (i.e., effective symplasmic permeability), but often yield very different values. Here, we build a theoretical bridge between both experimental approaches by calculating the effective symplasmic permeability from a geometrical description of individual PDs and considering the flow towards them. We find that a dilated central region has the strongest impact in thick cell walls and that clustering of PDs into pit fields strongly reduces predicted permeabilities. Moreover, our open source multi-level model allows to predict PD dimensions matching measured permeabilities and add a functional interpretation to structural differences observed between PDs in different cell walls.","['1 Mathematical and statistical methods (Biometris), Wageningen University, Wageningen, Netherlands.', '2 Living Matter Department, Institute AMOLF, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', '3 Laboratory of Cell Biology, Wageningen University, Wageningen, Netherlands.', '4 Centre for Plant Science, University of Leeds, Leeds, United Kingdom.']","Eva E Deinum, Bela M Mulder, Yoselin Benitez-Alfonso, ",eLife,2019,PDinsight; biophysical model; cell biology; effective permeability; none; plant biology; plasmodesmata; ultrastructure.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31755863

1118,A modified gas-trapping method for high-throughput metabolic experiments in Drosophila melanogaster,"Metabolism is often studied in animal models, with the Drosophila melanogaster fruit fly model offering ease of genetic manipulation and high-throughput studies. Fly metabolism is typically studied using end-point assays that are simple but destructive, and do not provide information on the utilization of specific nutrients. To address these limitations, we adapted existing gas-trapping protocols to measure the oxidation of radiolabeled substrates (such as glucose) in multi-well plates. This protocol is cost effective, simple, and offers precise control over experimental diet and measurement time, thus being amenable to high-throughput studies. Furthermore, it is nondestructive, enabling time-course experiments and multiplexing with other parameters. Overall, this protocol is useful for merging fly genetics with metabolic studies to understand whole organism responses to different macronutrients.","['1 Charles Perkins Centre, The University of Sydney, Camperdown, NSW\xa02006, Australia.', '2 School of Life & Environmental Sciences, The University of Sydney, Camperdown, NSW\xa02006, Australia.', '3 School of Medical Sciences, The University of Sydney, Camperdown, NSW\xa02006, Australia.']","Deanne Francis, James R Krycer, Gregory J Cooney, David E James, ",BioTechniques,2019 Sep,carbon dioxide; gas-trap; metabolic labelling; metabolism.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31385711
1119,Limitations of Ligand-Only Approaches for Predicting the Reactivity of Covalent Inhibitors,"Covalent inhibition has undergone a resurgence and is an important modern-day drug design and chemical biology approach. To avoid off-target interactions and to fine-tune reactivity, the ability to accurately predict reactivity is vitally important for the design and development of safer and more effective covalent drugs. Several ligand-only metrics have been proposed that promise quick and simple ways of determining covalent reactivity. In particular, we examine proton affinity and reaction energies calculated with the density functional B3LYP-D3/6-311+G**//B3LYP-D3/6-31G* method to assess the reactivity of a series of α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds that form covalent adducts with cysteine. We demonstrate that while these metrics correlate well with experiment for a diverse range of small reactive molecules these approaches fail for predicting the reactivity of drug-like compounds. We conclude that ligand-only metrics such as proton affinity and reaction energies do not capture determinants of reactivity in situ and fail to account for important factors such as conformation, solvation, and intermolecular interactions.","['1 Centre for Computational Chemistry, School of Chemistry , University of Bristol , Bristol BS8 1TS , United Kingdom.', '2 Computational Chemistry, Janssen Research & Development , Janssen Pharmaceutica N.

This increased complexity and heterogeneity of omics data are challenging data extraction, sensemaking, analyses, knowledge translation, and interpretation. An extended and dynamic taxonomy for the classification and summary of omics studies are essential. We present an updated taxonomy for classification of omics research studies based on four criteria: (1) type and number of genomic loci in a research study, (2) number of species and biological samples, (3) the type of omics technology (e.g., genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics) and omics technology application type (e.g., pharmacogenomics and nutrigenomics), and (4) phenotypes. In addition, we present a graphical summary approach that enables the researchers to define the main characteristics of their study in a single figure, and offers the readers to rapidly grasp the published study and omics data. We searched the PubMed and the Web of Science from 09/2002 to 02/2018, including research and review articles, and identified 90 scientific publications. We propose a call toward omics studies' standardization for reporting in scientific literature. We anticipate the proposed classification scheme will usefully contribute to improved classification of published reports in genomics and other omics fields, and help data extraction from publications for future multiomics data integration.","['1 Department of Animal Science, Biotechnical Faculty, University of Ljubljana , Domzale, Slovenia .']","Nina Pirih, Tanja Kunej, ",Omics : a journal of integrative biology,2018 May,classification; environmental omics; epigenomics; genomics; integrated omics; interactomics; metabolomics; miRNomics/ncRNomics; omics science; phenome; phenomics; proteomics; taxonomy; transcriptomics.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29762088

The epidemiology of ASD is continuously increasing all over the world with huge social and economical burdens. As the etiology of autism is not completely understood, there is still no medication available for the treatment of this disorder. However, some behavioral interventions are available to improve the core and associated symptoms of autism, particularly when initiated at an early stage. Thus, there is an increasing demand for finding biomarkers for ASD. Although diagnostic biomarkers have not yet been established, research efforts have been carried out in neuroimaging and biological analyses including genomics and gene testing, proteomics, metabolomics, transcriptomics, and studies of the immune system, inflammation, and microRNAs.

Historically, unbiased (or discovery) analysis has been performed independently of targeted, quantitative analysis such as multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). These practices have been aptly carried out based on technical limitations of each assay. The wide mass scanning ranges typical of discovery approaches limit assay sensitivity, while targeted methods that improve analyte detection do not acquire data on ions not included in the targeted assay design. Recent improvements to quadrupole-Orbitrap technology have improved both scan speed as well as sensitivity, thus making these instruments more robust. By combining the improved robustness and coverage with stable isotope dilution (SID) techniques, advantages of the separate assays can now be realized in a single run, thereby improving the throughput of this type of analysis.","['1 Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO, USA.', '2 Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO, USA. travis.nemkov@ucdenver.edu.']","Julie A Reisz, Connie Zheng, Angelo D'Alessandro, Travis Nemkov, ","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2019,Absolute quantification; Bile acids; Gradient; High-throughput; Mass spectrometry; Oxylipids; Untargeted metabolomics.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31119660

      Despite advances in the research on HDL composition (lipidomics and proteomics) and functions (cholesterol efflux and antioxidative capacities), the relationship between HDL compositional and functional properties is not fully understood. We have reviewed the recent literature on this topic and pointed out the difficulties which limit our understanding of HDL's role in cardiovascular disease (CVD). Recent findings:
      
    

    
      Though current findings strongly support that HDL has a significant role in CVD, the underlying mechanisms by which HDL mitigates CVD risk are not clear. This review focuses on studies that investigate the cell-cholesterol efflux capacity and the proteomic and lipidomic characterization of HDL and its subfractions especially those that analyzed the relationship between HDL composition and functions. Summary:
      
    

    
      Recent studies on HDL composition and HDL functions have greatly contributed to our understanding of HDL's role in CVD. A major problem in HDL research is the lack of standardization of both the HDL isolation and HDL functionality methods. Data generated by different methods often produce discordant results on the particle number, size, lipid and protein composition, and the various functions of HDL.","['1 Cardiovascular Nutrition Laboratory, Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging, Tufts University, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']","Bela F Asztalos, Katrin Niisuke, Katalin V Horvath, ",Current opinion in lipidology,2019 Aug,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31145119

Results:
      
    

    
      We developed a Virtual Research Environment (VRE) which facilitates rapid integration of new tools and developing scalable and interoperable workflows for performing metabolomics data analysis. The environment can be launched on-demand on cloud resources and desktop computers. IT-expertise requirements on the user side are kept to a minimum, and workflows can be re-used effortlessly by any novice user. We validate our method in the field of metabolomics on two mass spectrometry, one nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and one fluxomics study. We showed that the method scales dynamically with increasing availability of computational resources. We demonstrated that the method facilitates interoperability using integration of the major software suites resulting in a turn-key workflow encompassing all steps for mass-spectrometry-based metabolomics including preprocessing, statistics and identification.

However, reliable identification of the compounds remains a challenge affecting result interpretation. In this protocol, we describe comparable yeast cell and whole blood metabolome sample preparation for extracting similar compound groups, and we present a LC-MS method using the all ion fragmentation (AIF) approach for the purposes of increasing accuracy in metabolite annotation.

We model molecules and molecule interactions as port graphs and port graph rewrite rules, respectively. We use rewriting strategies to control which rules to apply, and where and when to apply them. Our main contributions to rule-based modelling of biochemical systems lie in the strategy language and the associated visual and interactive features offered by PORGY. These features facilitate an exploratory approach to test different ways of applying the rules while recording the model evolution, and tracking and plotting parameters. We illustrate PORGY's features with a study of the role of a scaffold protein in RAF/MEK/ERK signalling.","['1 School of Computing Science, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.', ""2 Department of Informatics, King's College London, London, UK."", '3 Inria Bordeaux Sud-Ouest, Inria, Talence, France.', '4 University of Bordeaux, CNRS UMR5800 LaBRI, Talence, France. bruno.pinaud@labri.fr.']","Oana Andrei, Maribel Fernández, Hélène Kirchner, Bruno Pinaud, ","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2019,Biochemical networks; Computational systems biology; Graph transformations; Rule-based modelling; Strategic rewriting; Visual Analytics Software.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30945242
1140,Distribution of natural ingredients suggests a complex network of metabolic transport between source and sink tissues in the brown alga Fucus vesiculosus,"Tight regulation of intra-thallus metabolite distribution in Fucus vesiculosus in late summer reveals the complex biochemical processes complying with reproduction and the preparation to the dark season. We used inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy to study the tissue-specific elemental composition, and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry to study the distribution of small-molecular weight primary and secondary metabolites of the brown alga Fucus vesiculosus thalli in the reproductive phase. Beyond general physiological requirements, the observed distribution of the analysed nutrients was also found to depend on characteristics related to the season of harvesting, i.e., the reproductive period. However, a particular curious result was the high metabolic activity found in the stipe of the plant. In conclusion, our data not only provide valuable information for industrial use of fucoids targeting specific algal ingredients, but also give highly interesting insights in the multifaceted system of intra-thallus biochemical interactions during reproduction of the brown algae.","['1 Faculty of Chemistry and Mineralogy, Leipzig University, 04103, Leipzig, Germany.', '2 Department of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, Faculty of Biology, St.-Petersburg State University, 199034, St.-Petersburg, Russia.', '3 Department of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, Faculty of Biology, St.-Petersburg State University, 199034, St.-Petersburg, Russia. e.tarahovskaya@spbu.ru.', '4 Department of Scientific Information, Russian Academy of Sciences Library, 199034, St.-Petersburg, Russia. e.tarahovskaya@spbu.ru.']","Claudia Birkemeyer, Natalia Osmolovskaya, Ludmila Kuchaeva, Elena Tarakhovskaya, ",Planta,2019 Feb,Elemental composition; Fucoid algae; Intra-thallus profiling; Long-distance transport; Metabolomics; Reproduction.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30209618

Due to their similarity in size and shape they are useful mimics of classic benzene moieties in drugs, so-called bioisosteres. Moreover, they also fulfill an important role in material sciences as linear linkers, in order to arrange various functionalities in a defined spatial manner. In this Review article, recent developments and usages of these special, rectilinear systems are discussed. Furthermore, we focus on covalently linked, nonconjugated linear arrangements and discuss the physical and chemical properties and differences of individual linkers, as well as their application in material and medicinal sciences.","['1 School of Chemistry, SFI Tetrapyrrole Laboratory, Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute, Trinity College Dublin, The University of Dublin, 152-160 Pearse Street, Dublin, 2, Ireland.']","Gemma M Locke, Stefan S R Bernhard, Mathias O Senge, ","Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2019,crystal engineering; electron transfer; liquid crystals; metal-organic frameworks; porphyrins.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30387906
1142,Current Challenges in Plant Eco-Metabolomics,"The relatively new research discipline of Eco-Metabolomics is the application of metabolomics techniques to ecology with the aim to characterise biochemical interactions of organisms across different spatial and temporal scales. Metabolomics is an untargeted biochemical approach to measure many thousands of metabolites in different species, including plants and animals. Changes in metabolite concentrations can provide mechanistic evidence for biochemical processes that are relevant at ecological scales. These include physiological, phenotypic and morphological responses of plants and communities to environmental changes and also interactions with other organisms. Traditionally, research in biochemistry and ecology comes from two different directions and is performed at distinct spatiotemporal scales. Biochemical studies most often focus on intrinsic processes in individuals at physiological and cellular scales. Generally, they take a bottom-up approach scaling up cellular processes from spatiotemporally fine to coarser scales. Ecological studies usually focus on extrinsic processes acting upon organisms at population and community scales and typically study top-down and bottom-up processes in combination. Eco-Metabolomics is a transdisciplinary research discipline that links biochemistry and ecology and connects the distinct spatiotemporal scales. In this review, we focus on approaches to study chemical and biochemical interactions of plants at various ecological levels, mainly plant⁻organismal interactions, and discuss related examples from other domains. We present recent developments and highlight advancements in Eco-Metabolomics over the last decade from various angles. We further address the five key challenges: (1) complex experimental designs and large variation of metabolite profiles; (2) feature extraction; (3) metabolite identification; (4) statistical analyses; and (5) bioinformatics software tools and workflows. The presented solutions to these challenges will advance connecting the distinct spatiotemporal scales and bridging biochemistry and ecology.","['1 Leibniz Institute of Plant Biochemistry, Stress and Developmental Biology, Weinberg 3, 06120 Halle (Saale), Germany. kpeters@ipb-halle.de.', '2 German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig, Deutscher Platz 5e, 04103 Leipzig, Germany. anja.widdig@eva.mpg.de.', '3 Institute of Biodiversity, Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Dornburger-Str. 159, 07743 Jena, Germany. anja.widdig@eva.mpg.de.', '4 UFZ-Helmholtz-Centre for Environmental Research, Department Environmental Microbiology, Permoserstraße 15, 04318 Leipzig, Germany. anja.widdig@eva.mpg.de.', '5 German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig, Deutscher Platz 5e, 04103 Leipzig, Germany. alexander.weinhold@idiv.de.', '6 Institute of Biodiversity, Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Dornburger-Str. 159, 07743 Jena, Germany. alexander.weinhold@idiv.de.', '7 Applied Bioinformatics Group, Center for Bioinformatics, University of Tübingen, Sand 14, 72076 Tübingen, Germany. alka@informatik.uni-tuebingen.de.', '8 Leibniz Institute of Plant Biochemistry, Cell and Metabolic Biology, Weinberg 3, 06120 Halle (Saale), Germany.

Filter aided sample preparation (FASP) is a method for processing of SDS-solubilized cells in a proteomic reactor format. In FASP, disposable centrifugal ultrafiltration units allow for detergent depletion, protein digestion, and isolation of peptides released by proteases from undigested material. Consecutive protein digestion with two or three proteases enables generation of peptide fractions with minimal overlap and considerably increases the number of identifications and protein sequence coverage. FASP is useful for analysis of samples varying in size from a few micrograms to several milligrams of total protein.","['1 Biochemical Proteomics Group, Department of Proteomics and Signal Transduction, Max-Planck Institute for Biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany. jwisniew@biochem.mpg.de.']","Jacek R Wiśniewski, ","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2018,Bottom-up proteomics; Filter-aided sample preparation (FASP); Multienzyme digestion FASP; Protein digestion; Proteomic reactor; Proteomic sample preparation; Sample preparation.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30259475
1144,To share or not to share: Incentivizing data sharing in life science communities,"Most scientists recognize the importance of sharing data online in an open fashion. Nonetheless, many studies have documented the concerns that accompany data sharing activities, including loss of credit or IP, misuse and the time needed to curate interoperable data. To this end, discussions around data sharing often identify incentives that could potentially ameliorate these disincentivising concerns. Nonetheless, current Open Data discussions often rely on evidence-based studies to identify the disincentives to overcome. This results in highly specific and directed interventions. In contrast, this paper offers a different interpretation of these concerns. To do so, it makes use of the Thomas Theorem which suggests that: ""If men define situations as real, they are real in their consequences"". Using empirical evidence from sub-Saharan African (bio)chemistry laboratories, this paper illustrates how individual perceptions of research environments - whether associated with evidence or not - are highly influential in shaping data sharing practices. It concludes with the suggestion that discussion on incentivising data sharing amongst scientific communities need to take a broader set of concerns into account and offer a more creative approach to ameliorating environmental disincentives.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Louise Bezuidenhout, ",Developing world bioethics,2019 Mar,Open Data; Thomas Theorem; data sharing; incentives; low/middle-income countries.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29356295

1146,Design of Experiments in metabolomics-related studies: An overview,"Nowadays, Design of Experiments (DoE) approach is a very popular methodology of planning and conducting experiments, where the effect of each tested factor on the studied responses is systematically examined and documented. The results obtained in such manner represent the design space more precisely than in the case of One-Variable-At-Time (OVAT) approach, leading to reliable and comprehensive results, while saving time and resources. Despite such a large increase of interest in this approach recently, its implementation in metabolomics research seems to be limited. Therefore, in this short overview, apart from summarizing some basic concepts of DoE, we wanted to provide a guideline for those who are about to plan metabolomics-related experiments. This overview is divided into four sections. In addition to the first section, which will introduce the history and basics of DoE, second part will provide concise description of the most popular experimental designs. Furthermore, third section will describe examples of DoE application in metabolomics and related studies.

1149,Preparation of Cellular Extracts from Xenopus Eggs and Embryos,"Cell-free cytoplasmic extracts prepared from Xenopus eggs have been used extensively to recapitulate and characterize intracellular events in vitro. Egg extracts can be induced to transit the cell cycle and reconstitute assembly of dynamic structures including the interphase nucleus and the mitotic spindle. In this protocol, methods are described for preparing crude cytoplasmic extracts from Xenopus eggs and embryos that are arrested in metaphase of the cell cycle. The basic protocol uses unfertilized Xenopus laevis eggs, which are crushed by centrifugation in the presence of EGTA to preserve the natural cytostatic factor (CSF) activity that maintains high levels of Cdk1/cyclin B kinase and metaphase arrest. In the second method, the basic procedure is adapted for Xenopus tropicalis eggs with minor modifications to accommodate differences in frog size, timing of egg laying, and temperature and salt sensitivity. The third variation takes advantage of the synchronous divisions of fertilized X. laevis eggs to generate extracts from embryos, which are arrested in metaphase by the addition of nondegradable cyclin B and an inhibitor of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) that together stabilize Cdk1/cyclin B kinase activity. Because they are obtained in much smaller amounts and their cell cycles are less perfectly synchronized, extracts prepared from embryos are less robust than egg extracts. X. laevis egg extracts have been used to study a wide range of cellular processes. In contrast, X. tropicalis egg extracts and X. laevis embryo extracts have been used primarily to characterize molecular mechanisms regulating spindle and nuclear size.","['1 Department of Cellular and Developmental Biology and Department of Bioengineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104; bheald@berkeley.edu mattgood@upenn.edu.', '2 Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720 bheald@berkeley.edu mattgood@upenn.edu.']","Matthew C Good, Rebecca Heald, ",Cold Spring Harbor protocols,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29437998

Despite numerous reports of FAD-dependent halogenases utilizing CP-tethered substrates, only a few have been biochemically characterized due to limited accessibility to the physiological substrates. Here, we describe a method for the preparation of acyl-S-CP substrates and their use in biochemical assays to query the activity of FAD-dependent halogenases. Furthermore, we describe a mass spectrometry-based method for the characterization of acyl-S-CP substrates and the corresponding halogenated products generated by the halogenases. Finally, we test the substrate specificity of a physiological chlorinase and a physiological brominase from marine bacteria, and, for the first time, demonstrate the distinct halide specificity of halogenases. The methodology described here will enable characterization of new halogenases employing CP-tethered substrates.","['1 School of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States.', '2 School of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States; School of Biological Sciences, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States.

1151,Removal of false positive features to generate authentic peak table for high-resolution mass spectrometry-based metabolomics study,"In metabolomics research, false positive features from non-sample sources and noises usually exist in the peak table, they will make the results of screening differential metabolites or biomarkers unreliable. In this study, a method to remove false positive features (rFPF) was developed to improve the quality of the peak table. rFPF recognizes real peak profiles based on the information entropy and statistical correlation, and eliminates false positive features from non-sample sources and noises. A standard mixture with 42 standards (14 isotopic labeled internal standards and 28 common standards) and a urine sample were applied to evaluate the effectiveness of the rFPF method. The analysis results of metabolite standards showed that more than 92% false positive features were removed by rFPF, but target standards completely remained. The analysis results of urine sample showed that the number of features was significantly reduced from 7182 to 2522. Interestingly, 98% of the identified metabolites remained after removing false positive features. The proposed rFPF shows great prospects as a new data handling method for metabolomics studies.

1152,Simultaneous optimization of mixed photon energy beams in volumetric modulated arc therapy,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      Despite the availability of multiple energy photon beams on clinical linear accelerators, volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) optimization is currently limited to a single photon beam. The purpose of this work was to present a proof-of-principle study on an algorithm for simultaneous optimization of mixed photon beams for VMAT (MP - VMAT), utilizing an additional photon energy as an additional degree of freedom. Methods:
      
    

    
      The MP - VMAT optimization algorithm is presented as a two-step heuristic approach. First, a convex linear programming problem is solved for simultaneous optimization of nonuniform dual energy intensity maps (DEIMs) for an angular resolution of 36 equi-spaced beam segments. Subsequently, for a given gantry speed schedule, the second step aims to best replicate each DEIM by dispersing MP - VMAT apertures along with their corresponding intensities over their respective beam segment. This constitutes a nonlinear problem, which is linearized using McCormick relaxation. The final large-scale mixed integer linear programming (MILP) dispersion model ensures a contiguous and smooth transition of multileaf collimators (MLCs) from one beam segment to the next. To demonstrate the proof-of-principle, we first compared the quality of dose volume histograms (DVHs) of MP - VMAT to the ones calculated from 36 DEIMs following the step 1 of MP - VMAT model. Additionally, the MLCs motion violations were evaluated for the complete 360° gantry rotation for gantry speeds ranging from 1 to 6° per second. The quality of MP - VMAT plans were also compared to conventional single energy VMAT plans via DVH, homogeneity index (HI), and conformity number (CN) for two prostate cases. Results:
      
    

    
      The MP - VMAT model resulted in a successful convergence of DVHs relative to the ones from DEIMs with HI and CN of 0.05 and 0.9, respectively, for 1 and 2° per second gantry speed schedules. In replicating the DEIMs, the MILP dispersion model was able to achieve optimality for almost all segments at 1° per second and for majority of segments at 2° per second. Although, DVHs quality was slightly inferior for 3° per second gantry speed, the target conformity of 0.9 and heterogeneity of 0.08 were achievable even for the suboptimal solutions. No violations of the MLC constraints were observed throughout the complete 360 degree arc rotation for any gantry speed schedule, thereby confirming MILP dispersion model. For the two prostate cases, the results showed MP - VMAT's ability to achieve substantial dose reduction in rectum and bladder while yielding similar target coverage compared to single energy VMAT. Bladder volume was mostly spared in low-to-intermediate dose region. Rectal volume sparing (3 % to 12 %) was observed in the intermediate (from 25 to 50 Gy) dose region. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      We demonstrate the first formalism of a large-scale simultaneous optimization of mixed photon energy beams for VMAT. Dosimetric comparison of MP - VMAT to single energy VMAT demonstrated potential advantages of using mixed photon energy beams for prostate plans, thus providing an impetus for further testing on a large clinical cohort.","['1 Department of Radiation Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA.', '2 Department of Physics, Ryerson University, Toronto, ON, Canada.', '3 Department of Mathematics, Ryerson University, Toronto, ON, Canada.']","Shadab Momin, James Gräfe, Konstantinos Georgiou, Rao Khan, ",Medical physics,2019 Sep,mixed integer linear programming; mixed photon beam radiotherapy; simultaneous optimization; treatment planning; volumetric modulated arc therapy.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31276215
1153,6-MV small field output factors: intra-/intermachine comparison and implementation of TRS-483 using various detectors and several linear accelerators,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      To investigate the applicability of output correction factors reported in TRS-483 on 6-MV small-field detector-reading ratios using four solid-state detectors. Also, to investigate variations in 6-MV small-field output factors (OF) among nominally matched linear accelerators (linacs). Methods:
      
    

    
      The TRS-483 Code of Practice (CoP) introduced and provided output correction factors to be applied to measured detector-reading ratios to obtain OFs for several small-field detectors. Detector readings for 0.5 cm × 0.5 cm to 8 cm × 8 cm fields were measured and normalized to that of 10 cm × 10 cm field giving the detector-reading ratios. Three silicon diodes, IBA PFD, IBA EFD (IBA, Schwarzenbruck, Germany), PTW T60017, and one microdiamond, PTW T60019 (PTW, Freiburg, Germany), were used. Output correction factors from the CoP were applied to measured detector-reading ratios. Measurements were performed on six Clinac and six TrueBeam linacs (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, USA). An investigation of the relationship between the size of small fields and corresponding detector-reading ratio among the linacs was performed by measuring lateral dose profiles for 0.5 cm × 0.5 cm fields to determine the full width half maximum (FWHM). The relationship between the linacs' focal spot size and the small-field detector-reading ratio was investigated by measuring 10 cm × 10 cm lateral dose profiles and determining the penumbra width reflecting the focal spot size. Measurement geometry was as follows: gantry angle = 0°, collimator angle = 0°, source-to surface distance (SSD) = 90 cm, and depth in water = 10 cm. Results:
      
    

    
      For a given linac and 0.5 cm × 0.5 cm field, the deviations in detector-reading ratios among the detectors were 9%-15% for the Clinacs and 4%-5% for the TrueBeams. Use of output correction factors reduced these deviations to 6%-12% and 3%-4%, respectively. For field sizes equal to or larger than 0.8 cm × 0.8 cm, the deviations were corrected to 1% using output correction factors for both Clinacs and TrueBeams. For a given detector and 0.5 cm × 0.5 cm field, the deviations in detector-reading ratios among the linacs were 11%-17% for the Clinacs and 5-6% for the TrueBeams. For 1 cm × 1 cm the deviations were 1%-2% for Clinacs and 1% for TrueBeams. For field sizes larger than 1 cm × 1 cm the deviations were within 1% for both Clinacs and TrueBeams. No relationship between FWHMs and detector-reading ratios for 0.5 cm × 0.5 cm was observed. For Clinacs, larger 10 cm × 10 cm penumbra width yielded lower 0.5 cm × 0.5 cm detector-reading ratio indicating an effect of the focal spot size. For TrueBeams, the spread of penumbra widths was lower compared to Clinacs and no similar relationship was observed. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Output correction factors from the TRS-483 CoP are not sufficient for accurate determination of OF for 0.5 cm × 0.5 cm fields but are applicable for 0.8 cm × 0.8 cm to 8 cm × 8 cm fields. Nominally matched Clinacs and TrueBeams show large differences in detector-reading ratios for fields smaller than 1 cm × 1 cm.","['1 Department of Medical Radiation Physics and Nuclear Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital, SE-171 76, Stockholm, Sweden.', '2 Radiation Physics, Department of Medical and Health Sciences, Linköping University, SE-581 85, Linköping, Sweden.']","Mohammed Ghazal, Mathias Westermark, Vaiva Kaveckyte, Åsa Carlsson-Tedgren, Hamza Benmakhlouf, ",Medical physics,2019 Nov,output correction factors; output factors; small-field dosimetry.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31532831

1155,A new Monte Carlo code for light transport in biological tissue,"The aim of this work was to develop an event-by-event Monte Carlo code for light transport (called MCLTmx) to identify and quantify ballistic, diffuse, and absorbed photons, as well as their interaction coordinates inside the biological tissue. The mean free path length was computed between two interactions for scattering or absorption processes, and if necessary scatter angles were calculated, until the photon disappeared or went out of region of interest. A three-layer array (air-tissue-air) was used, forming a semi-infinite sandwich. The light source was placed at (0,0,0), emitting towards (0,0,1). The input data were: refractive indices, target thickness (0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, and 1 cm), number of particle histories, and λ from which the code calculated: anisotropy, scattering, and absorption coefficients. Validation presents differences less than 0.1% compared with that reported in the literature. The MCLTmx code discriminates between ballistic and diffuse photons, and inside of biological tissue, it calculates: specular reflection, diffuse reflection, ballistics transmission, diffuse transmission and absorption, and all parameters dependent on wavelength and thickness. The MCLTmx code can be useful for light transport inside any medium by changing the parameters that describe the new medium: anisotropy, dispersion and attenuation coefficients, and refractive indices for specific wavelength.","['1 Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Autónoma del Estado de México, Paseo Tollocan s/n esquina Jesús Carranza, Col.

1156,Phenotyping reproductive stage chilling and frost tolerance in wheat using targeted metabolome and lipidome profiling,"Introduction:
      
    

    
      Frost events lead to A$360 million of yield losses annually to the Australian wheat industry, making improvement of chilling and frost tolerance an important trait for breeding. Objectives:
      
    

    
      This study aimed to use metabolomics and lipidomics to explore genetic variation in acclimation potential to chilling and to identify metabolite markers for chilling tolerance in wheat. Methods:
      
    

    
      We established a controlled environment screening assay that is able to reproduce field rankings of wheat germplasm for chilling and frost tolerance. This assay, together with targeted metabolomics and lipidomics approaches, were used to compare metabolite and lipid levels in flag leaves of two wheat varieties with contrasting chilling tolerance. Results:
      
    

    
      The sensitive variety Wyalkatchem showed a strong reduction in amino acids after the first cold night, followed by accumulation of osmolytes such as fructose, glucose, putrescine and shikimate over a 4-day period. Accumulation of osmolytes is indicative of acclimation to water stress in Wyalkatchem. This response was not observed for tolerant variety Young. The two varieties also displayed significant differences in lipid accumulation. Variation in two lipid clusters, resulted in a higher unsaturated to saturated lipid ratio in Young after 4 days cold treatment and the lipids PC(34:0), PC(34:1), PC(35:1), PC(38:3), and PI(36:4) were the main contributors to the unsaturated to saturated ratio change. This indicates that Young may have superior ability to maintain membrane fluidity following cold exposure, thereby avoiding membrane damage and water stress observed for Wyalkatchem. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Our study suggests that metabolomics and lipidomics markers could be used as an alternative phenotyping method to discriminate wheat varieties with differences in cold acclimation.","['1 School of BioSciences, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, 3010, Australia.', '2 Melbourne Integrative Genomics, Schools of Mathematics and Statistics and of BioSciences, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, 3010, Australia.', '3 Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development, 3 Baron Hay Court, South Perth, WA, 6151, Australia.', '4 CSIRO Agriculture & Food, GPO Box 1700, Canberra, ACT, 2601, Australia.', '5 Metabolomics Australia, School of BioSciences, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, 3010, Australia.', '6 CSIRO Agriculture & Food, GPO Box 1700, Canberra, ACT, 2601, Australia. rudy.dolferus@csiro.au.']","Bo Eng Cheong, William Wing Ho Ho, Ben Biddulph, Xiaomei Wallace, Tina Rathjen, Thusitha W T Rupasinghe, Ute Roessner, Rudy Dolferus, ",Metabolomics : Official journal of the Metabolomic Society,2019,Cold tolerance; Flowering; Lipid; Metabolite; Phenotyping; Wheat.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31630279
1157,Use of recombinant proteins as a simple and robust normalization method for untargeted proteomics screening: exhaustive performance assessment,"The label-free quantitative mass spectrometry methods, in particular, the SWATH-MS approach, have gained popularity and became a powerful technique for comparison of large datasets. In the present work, it is evaluated the use of recombinant proteins as internal standards for untargeted label-free methods. The proposed internal standard strategy reveals a similar intragroup normalization capacity when compared with the most common normalization methods, with the additional advantage of maintaining the overall proteome changes between groups (which is buffered with the use of other methods). Therefore, the proposed strategy is able to maintain a good performance even when large qualitative and quantitative differences in sample composition are observed, such as the ones induced by biological regulation (as observed in secretome and other biofluids' analyses) or by enrichment approaches (such as immunopurifications). Moreover, this approach corresponds to a cost-effective and simple normalization method altrenative, therefore being an appealing strategy for large quantitative screening, as the analysis of clinical cohorts for biomarker discovery.","['1 CNC, Center for Neuroscience and Cell Biology, University of Coimbra, Portugal; Faculty of Sciences and Technology, University of Coimbra, Portugal; Faculty Medicine, University of Coimbra, Portugal.

1159,Chaos and multi-scroll attractors in RCL-shunted junction coupled Jerk circuit connected by memristor,"In this paper, a new four-variable dynamical system is proposed to set chaotic circuit composed of memristor and Josephson junction, and the dependence of chaotic behaviors on nonlinearity is investigated. A magnetic flux-controlled memristor is used to couple with the RCL-shunted junction circuit, and the dynamical behaviors can be modulated by changing the coupling intensity between the memristor and the RCL-shunted junction. Bifurcation diagram and Lyapunov exponent are calculated to confirm the emergence of chaos in the improved dynamical system. The outputs and dynamical behaviors can be controlled by the initial setting and external stimulus as well. As a result, chaos can be suppressed and spiking occurs in the sampled outputs under negative feedback, while applying positive feedback type via memristor can be effective to trigger chaos. Furthermore, it is found that the number of multi-attractors in the Jerk circuit can be modulated when memristor coupling is applied on the circuit. These results indicate that memristor coupling can be effective to control chaotic circuits and it is also useful to reproduce dynamical behaviors for neuronal activities.","['1 School of Science, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China.', '2 Department of Physics, Lanzhou University of Technology, Lanzhou, China.', '3 NAAM-Research Group, Department of Mathematics, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.']","Jun Ma, Ping Zhou, Bashir Ahmad, Guodong Ren, Chunni Wang, ",PloS one,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29342178
1160,Simultaneous study of mechanobiology and calcium dynamics on hESC-derived cardiomyocytes clusters,"Calcium ions act like ubiquitous second messengers in a wide amount of cellular processes. In cardiac myocytes, Ca2+ handling regulates the mechanical contraction necessary to the heart pump function. The field of intracellular and intercellular Ca2+ handling, employing in vitro models of cardiomyocytes, has become a cornerstone to understand the role and adaptation of calcium signalling in healthy and diseased hearts. Comprehensive in vitro systems and cell-based biosensors are powerful tools to enrich and speed up cardiac phenotypic and drug response evaluation. We have implemented a combined setup to measure contractility and calcium waves in human embryonic stem cells-derived cardiomyocyte 3D clusters, obtained from embryoid body differentiation. A combination of atomic force microscopy to monitor cardiac contractility, and sensitive fast scientific complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor camera for epifluorescence video recording, provided correlated signals in real time. To speed up the integrated data processing, we tested several post-processing algorithms, to improve the automatic detection of relevant functional parameters. The validation of our proposed method was assessed by caffeine stimulation (10mM) and detection/characterization of the induced cardiac response. We successfully report the first simultaneous recording of cardiac contractility and calcium waves on the described cardiac 3D models. The drug stimulation confirmed the automatic detection capabilities of the used algorithms, measuring expected physiological response, such as elongation of contraction time and Ca2+ cytosolic persistence, increased calcium basal fluorescence, and transient peaks. These results contribute to the implementation of novel, integrated, high-information, and reliable experimental systems for cardiac models and drug evaluation.","['1 International Clinical Research Centre of Saint Anne Hospital of Brno (FNUSA-ICRC), Interventional Cardiac Electrophysiology Group, Brno, Czech Republic.', '2 Nanobiotechnology Group, Central European Institute of Technology of Masaryk University (CEITEC-MU), Brno, Czech Republic.', '3 Department of Biomedical Engineering, Brno University of Technology, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Communication, Brno, Czech Republic.', '4 Department of Biology, Masaryk University, Faculty of Medicine, Brno, Czech Republic.']","Guido Caluori, Jan Pribyl, Vratislav Cmiel, Martin Pesl, Tomas Potocnak, Ivo Provaznik, Petr Skladal, Vladimir Rotrekl, ",Journal of molecular recognition : JMR,2019 Feb,atomic force microscopy; biosignals filtering; caffeine; calcium imaging; cardiac differentiation; embryoid bodies; fluorescence microscopy; human stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30084213

However, there are at least 1-2 million protein entities that are expressed in a cell at a given time. This is primarily due to alternative splicing in different cells and tissues, which may lead to expression of different protein isoforms within one cell, but also different protein isoforms in different tissues. A new level of complexity of proteins and protein isoforms is then given by posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of proteins. Here, we discuss the PTMs in proteins and how they are identified by mass spectrometry and proteomics, with specific examples on identification of acetylation, phosphorylation, glycosylation, alkylation, hydroxinonenal-modification or assignment of intramolecular and intermolecular disulfide bridges.","['1 Biochemistry & Proteomics Group, Department of Chemistry & Biomolecular Science, Clarkson University, Potsdam, NY, USA. aslebar@clarkson.edu.', '2 Biochemistry & Proteomics Group, Department of Chemistry & Biomolecular Science, Clarkson University, Potsdam, NY, USA.', '3 Biochemistry & Proteomics Group, Department of Chemistry & Biomolecular Science, Clarkson University, Potsdam, NY, USA. cdarie@clarkson.edu.']","Roshanak Aslebagh, Kelly L Wormwood, Devika Channaveerappa, Armand G Ngounou Wetie, Alisa G Woods, Costel C Darie, ",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,2019,Mass spectrometry; Posttranslational modifications; Proteomics.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31347049
1162,Parasitological research in the molecular age,"New technological methods, such as rapidly developing molecular approaches, often provide new tools for scientific advances. However, these new tools are often not utilized equally across different research areas, possibly leading to disparities in progress between these areas. Here, we use empirical evidence from the scientific literature to test for potential discrepancies in the use of genetic tools to study parasitic vs non-parasitic organisms across three distinguishable molecular periods, the allozyme, nucleotide and genomics periods. Publications on parasites constitute only a fraction (<5%) of the total research output across all molecular periods and are dominated by medically relevant parasites (especially protists), particularly during the early phase of each period. Our analysis suggests an increasing complexity of topics and research questions being addressed with the development of more sophisticated molecular tools, with the research focus between the periods shifting from predominantly species discovery to broader theory-focused questions. We conclude that both new and older molecular methods offer powerful tools for research on parasites, including their diverse roles in ecosystems and their relevance as human pathogens. While older methods, such as barcoding approaches, will continue to feature in the molecular toolbox of parasitologists for years to come, we encourage parasitologists to be more responsive to new approaches that provide the tools to address broader questions.","['1 Department of Zoology, University of Otago, 340 Great King St, Dunedin, 9016, New Zealand.', '2 Department of Anatomy, University of Otago, 270 Great King St, Dunedin, 9016, New Zealand.', '3 Programa de Pós-Graduação em Ecologia e Conservação, Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul, 79070-900 Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil.', '4 Programa de Pós-Graduação em Etnobiologia e Conservação da Natureza, Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco, Rua Dom Manuel de Medeiros, Dois Irmãos, 52171-900 Recife, PE, Brazil.']","Christian Selbach, Fátima Jorge, Eddy Dowle, Jerusha Bennett, Xuhong Chai, Jean-François Doherty, Alan Eriksson, Antoine Filion, Eleanor Hay, Ryan Herbison, Jocelyn Lindner, Eunji Park, Bronwen Presswell, Brandon Ruehle, Paulo M Sobrinho, Eleanor Wainwright, Robert Poulin, ",Parasitology,2019 Sep,Allozyme; genomics; molecular tools; nucleotide sequencing; publication trends.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31142396
1163,Comparison of metaproteomics workflows for deciphering the functions of gut microbiota in an animal model of obesity,"Metaproteomics has emerged as a new, revolutionary approach to study gut microbiota functionality, but the lack of consistent studies in this field due to the great complexity of samples has prompted to search new strategies to achieve better metaproteome characterization. Some steps in sample preparation and data analysis procedures are critical for obtaining accurate results, therefore protein extraction buffers, digestion procedures and fractionation steps were tested here. Initially, two lysis buffers were used to improve protein extraction, two common digestion protocols were compared, and fractionation processes were employed at both the peptide and protein levels. The combination of these procedures resulted in five different methodologies; SDS buffer, in-gel digestion and fractionation at the peptide level provided the best results. Finally, the metaproteomics workflow was tested in a real case study with obese rats, in which a metagenomics study was previously performed. Important differences in protein levels were observed between groups that were potentially related to the taxonomical family, indicating that functional processes are modulated by the microbiota. Therefore, in addition to the necessity of combining different metaomics approaches, an optimized metaproteomics workflow such as the presented in this study is required to obtain a better understanding of the microbiota function. SIGNIFICANCE: Gut microbiota has emerged as an important factor with affects the health balance in host. To study its function new methodologies are necessary and the most appropriate one seems to be metaproteomics. The lack of studies in this field requires a deeply research in the most accurate workflow to better comprehend such complex samples. In this paper, five different methodologies have been compared, mainly in the most critical steps in classical proteomics and the methodology chosen was validated in a real case study in obese animals.","['1 Universitat Rovira i Virgili, Biochemistry and Biotechnology Department, Nutrigenomics Research Group, Tarragona, Spain; Eurecat, Centre Tecnològic de Catalunya, Centre for Omic Sciences (COS), Joint Unit Universitat Rovira i Virgili-EURECAT, Unique Scientific and Technical Infrastructures (ICTS), Reus, Spain.', '2 Eurecat, Centre Tecnològic de Catalunya, Centre for Omic Sciences (COS), Joint Unit Universitat Rovira i Virgili-EURECAT, Unique Scientific and Technical Infrastructures (ICTS), Reus, Spain.', '3 Universitat Rovira i Virgili, Biochemistry and Biotechnology Department, Nutrigenomics Research Group, Tarragona, Spain.', '4 Eurecat, Centre Tecnològic de Catalunya, Centre for Omic Sciences (COS), Joint Unit Universitat Rovira i Virgili-EURECAT, Unique Scientific and Technical Infrastructures (ICTS), Reus, Spain; Universitat Rovira i Virgili, Biochemistry and Biotechnology Department, Tarragona, Spain.', '5 Universitat Rovira i Virgili, Biochemistry and Biotechnology Department, Nutrigenomics Research Group, Tarragona, Spain; Eurecat, Centre Tecnològic de Catalunya, Biotechnological Area, Reus, Spain.', '6 Eurecat, Centre Tecnològic de Catalunya, Centre for Omic Sciences (COS), Joint Unit Universitat Rovira i Virgili-EURECAT, Unique Scientific and Technical Infrastructures (ICTS), Reus, Spain.

1164,"Bistability, Causality, and Complexity in Cortical Networks: An In Vitro Perturbational Study","Measuring the spatiotemporal complexity of cortical responses to direct perturbations provides a reliable index of the brain's capacity for consciousness in humans under both physiological and pathological conditions. Upon loss of consciousness, the complex pattern of causal interactions observed during wakefulness collapses into a stereotypical slow wave, suggesting that cortical bistability may play a role. Bistability is mainly expressed in the form of slow oscillations, a default pattern of activity that emerges from cortical networks in conditions of functional or anatomical disconnection. Here, we employ an in vitro model to understand the relationship between bistability and complexity in cortical circuits. We adapted the perturbational complexity index applied in humans to electrically stimulated cortical slices under different neuromodulatory conditions. At this microscale level, we demonstrate that perturbational complexity can be effectively modulated by pharmacological reduction of bistability and, albeit to a lesser extent, by enhancement of excitability, providing mechanistic insights into the macroscale measurements performed in humans.","[""1 IDIBAPS (Institut D'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer), Roselló 149-153, Barcelona, Spain."", '2 Federal University of São Paulo, Institute of Science and Technology, Av.

1165,Application of Electrophysiology Measurement to Study the Activity of Electro-Neutral Transporters,"The transport of ions through cell membranes ensures the fine control of ion content within and outside the cell that is indispensable for cell survival. These transport mechanisms are mediated by the activities of specialized transporter proteins. Specifically,pH dynamics are finely controlled by plasma membrane proton (H+) extrusion systems, such as the Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) protein family. Despite extensive efforts to study the mechanisms underlying NHE regulation, our current understanding of the biophysical and molecular properties of the NHE family is inadequate because of the limited availability of methods to effectively measure NHE activity. In this manuscript, we used H+-selective electrodes during whole-cell patch clamping recording to measure NHE-induced H+ flux. We proposed this approach to overcome some limitations of typically used methods to measure NHE activity, such as radioactive uptake and fluorescent membrane permeants. Measurement of NHE activity using the described method enables high sensitivity and time resolution and more efficient control of intracellular H+ concentrations. H+-selective electrodes are based on the fact that transporter activity creates an ion gradient in close proximity to the cell membrane. An H+-selective electrode moving up to and away from the cell membrane in a repetitive, oscillatory fashion records a voltage difference that is dependent on H+ flux. While H+-selective electrodes are used to detect H+ flux moving out of the cell, the patch clamp method in the whole-cell configuration is used to control the intracellular ion composition.

1167,Automatic data analysis workflow for ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry-based metabolomics,"Data analysis for ultra-performance liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry-based metabolomics is a challenging task. The present work provides an automatic data analysis workflow (AntDAS2) by developing three novel algorithms, as follows: (i) a density-based ion clustering algorithm is designed for extracted-ion chromatogram extraction from high-resolution mass spectrometry; (ii) a new maximal value-based peak detection method is proposed with the aid of automatic baseline correction and instrumental noise estimation; and (iii) the strategy that clusters high-resolution m/z peaks to simultaneously align multiple components by a modified dynamic programing is designed to efficiently correct time-shift problem across samples. Standard compounds and complex datasets are used to study the performance of AntDAS2. AntDAS2 is better than several state-of-the-art methods, namely, XCMS Online, Mzmine2, and MS-DIAL, to identify underlying components and improve pattern recognition capability. Meanwhile, AntDAS2 is more efficient than XCMS Online and Mzmine2.

1168,ProteomicsBrowser: MS/proteomics data visualization and investigation,"Summary:
      
    

    
      Large-scale, quantitative proteomics data are being generated at ever increasing rates by high-throughput, mass spectrometry technologies. However, due to the complexity of these large datasets as well as the increasing numbers of post-translational modifications (PTMs) that are being identified, developing effective methods for proteomic visualization has been challenging. ProteomicsBrowser was designed to meet this need for comprehensive data visualization. Using peptide information files exported from mass spectrometry search engines or quantitative tools as input, the peptide sequences are aligned to an internal protein database such as UniProtKB. Each identified peptide ion including those with PTMs is then visualized along the parent protein in the Browser. A unique property of ProteomicsBrowser is the ability to combine overlapping peptides in different ways to focus analysis of sequence coverage, charge state or PTMs. ProteomicsBrowser includes other useful functions, such as a data filtering tool and basic statistical analyses to qualify quantitative data.

The agricultural yield has increased due to the use of bioinoculants over chemical-based fertilizers, and thus it generates interest in understanding the innovation process by various methods. By gene-editing tool, the desired gene product can be changed for engineered microbial inoculants. We have also described various modern biotechnological tools like constraint-based modeling, OptKnock, flux balance analysis and modeling of the biological network for enhancing the bioinoculant capability. These fluxes give the fascinating perception of the metabolic network in the absence of comprehensive kinetic information. These tools also help in the stimulation of the metabolic networks by incorporation of enzyme-encoding genes. The present review explains the use of systems biology and gene-editing tools for improving the capability of bioinoculants.

      Systematic and comprehensive analysis of protein subcellular location as a critical part of proteomics ('location proteomics') has been studied for many years, but annotating protein subcellular locations and understanding variation of the location patterns across various cell types and states is still challenging. Results:
      
    

    
      In this work, we used immunohistochemistry images from the Human Protein Atlas as the source of subcellular location information, and built classification models for the complex protein spatial distribution in normal and cancerous tissues. The models can automatically estimate the fractions of protein in different subcellular locations, and can help to quantify the changes of protein distribution from normal to cancer tissues. In addition, we examined the extent to which different annotated protein pathways and complexes showed similarity in the locations of their member proteins, and then predicted new potential proteins for these networks.

1174,When forensic odontology met biochemistry: Multidisciplinary approach in forensic human identification,"When human remains are found, the priority of the investigation is to ascertain the identity of the deceased. A positive identification is a key factor in providing closure for the family of the deceased; it is also required to issue the death certificate and therefore, to settle legal affairs. Moreover, it is difficult for any forensic investigation involving human remains to be solved without the determination of an identity. Therefore, personal identification is necessary for social, legal and forensic reasons. In the last thirty years forensic odontology has experienced an important transformation, from primarily involving occasional dental identification into a broader role, contributing to the determination of the biological profile. In the same way, ""DNA fingerprinting"" has evolved not only in terms of improving its technology, but also in its application beyond the ""classical"": helping with the estimation of sex, age and ancestry. As these two forensic disciplines have developed independently, their pathways have crossed several times through human identification operations, especially the ones that require a multidisciplinary approach. Thus, the aim of this review is to describe the contributions of both forensic odontology and molecular biology/biochemistry to human identification, demonstrating how a multidisciplinary approach can lead to a better and more efficient identification.","['1 University of Girona, Emili Grahit 77, Girona, Cataluña, Spain.

De novo analysis requires an alphabet of mass difference values used to link peaks in fragmentation spectra when they are different by a mass in the alphabet divided by a charge. Often, this alphabet is not known, prohibiting de novo analysis. A method is proposed that, given fragmentation mass spectra, identifies an alphabet of m/z differences that can build large connected graphs from many intense peaks in each spectrum from a collection.

      Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is commonly used to infer hemodynamic changes in the brain after increased neural activity, measuring the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal. An important challenge in the analyses of fMRI data is to develop methods that can accurately deconvolve the BOLD signal to extract the driving neural activity and the underlying cerebrovascular effects. New method:
      
    

    
      A biophysically based method is developed, which combines an extensively verified physiological hemodynamic model with a Wiener filter, to deconvolve the BOLD signal. Results:
      
    

    
      The method is able to simultaneously obtain spatiotemporal images of underlying neurovascular signals, including neural activity, cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume, and deoxygenated hemoglobin concentration. The method is tested on simulated data and applied to various experimental data to demonstrate its stability, accuracy, and utility. Comparison with existing methods:
      
    

    
      The resulting profiles of the deconvolved signals are consistent with measurements reported in the literature, obtained via multiple neuroimaging modalities. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The method provides new testable predictions of the spatiotemporal relations of the deconvolved signals for future studies. This demonstrates the ability of the method to quantify and analyze the neurovascular mechanisms that underlie fMRI, thereby expanding its potential uses.","['1 School of Physics, University of Sydney, New South Wales 2006, Australia; Center for Integrative Brain Function, University of Sydney, New South Wales 2006, Australia.

Conclusions:
      
    

    
      It may be concluded that despite advances in OC therapy, symptomatic presentation occurs at an advanced stage, where various curative treatment options become very limited.

1180,Current Technologies for Complex Glycoproteomics and Their Applications to Biology/Disease-Driven Glycoproteomics,"Glycoproteomics is an important recent advance in the field of glycoscience. In glycomics, glycan structures are comprehensively analyzed after glycans are released from glycoproteins. However, a major limitation of glycomics is the lack of insight into glycoprotein functions. The Biology/Disease-driven Human Proteome Project has a particular focus on biological and medical applications. Glycoproteomics technologies aimed at obtaining a comprehensive understanding of intact glycoproteins, i.e., the kind of glycan structures that are attached to particular amino acids and proteins, have been developed. This Review focuses on the recent progress of the technologies and their applications. First, the methods for large-scale identification of both N- and O-glycosylated proteins are summarized. Next, the progress of analytical methods for intact glycopeptides is outlined. MS/MS-based methods were developed for improving the sensitivity and speed of the mass spectrometer, in parallel with the software for complex spectrum assignment. In addition, a unique approach to identify intact glycopeptides using MS1-based accurate masses is introduced. Finally, as an advance of glycomics, two approaches to provide the spatial distribution of glycans in cells are described, i.e., MS imaging and lectin microarray. These methods allow rapid glycomic profiling of different types of biological samples and thus facilitate glycoproteomics.","['1 Biotechnology Research Institute for Drug Discovery , National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), 1-1-1 Umezono , Tsukuba , Ibaraki 305-8568 , Japan.', '2 Copenhagen Center for Glycomics , University of Copenhagen , Blegdamsvej 3 , Copenhagen 2200 , Denmark.', '3 Center for Biomarker Discovery and Translation , Johns Hopkins University , 400 North Broadway , Baltimore , Maryland 21205 , United States.', '4 Shanghai Center for Systems Biomedicine, Key Laboratory of Systems Biomedicine (Ministry of Education) , Shanghai Jiao Tong University , 800 Dong Chuan Road , Minhang , Shanghai 200240 , P.R.

      To assess the in vitro optical quality of monofocal aspheric toric intraocular lenses (IOLs) as a function of the cylindrical power. Methods:
      
    

    
      The in vitro optical quality of the AcrySof IQ Toric IOLs SN6AT2, SN6AT3, SN6AT4, SN6AT5 and SN6AT6 (Alcon Laboratories Inc., Forth Worth, TX, USA) was assessed with an instrument conceived for measuring Zernike's coefficients at 3.0- and 5.0-mm apertures. As a reference, the aspheric monofocal lens AcrySof IQ Aspheric SN60WF (Alcon Laboratories Inc., Forth Worth, TX, USA) was also measured. The area of visibility and cut-off frequency were used to describe the modulation transfer function (MTF) of each lens; meanwhile, the light in the bucket and the diameter of a circular area centred on the point-spread function (PSF) peak that captures 50% of the light energy were used to describe the PSF of each lens. Finally, an image simulation was computed from the Zernike values with reference purposes. Results:
      
    

    
      Small differences were found on the metrics used for describing the MTF and PSF of the lenses at both tested apertures, but these were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Furthermore, the image simulation showed that these differences would not have clinical relevance at all. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The optical performance of the AcrySof IQ toric IOLs in terms of MTF and PSF is good and seems to be independent of the cylindrical power and similar to a non-toric aspheric lens.","['1 Optometry Research Group (GIO), Department of Optics and Optometry and Vision Sciences, University of Valencia, C/Dr Moliner, 50, 46100, Burjassot, Spain.', '2 Fernández-Vega Ophthalmological Institute, Oviedo, Spain.', '3 Surgery Department, School of Medicine, University of Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain.', '4 Optometry Research Group (GIO), Department of Optics and Optometry and Vision Sciences, University of Valencia, C/Dr Moliner, 50, 46100, Burjassot, Spain. josejuan.esteve@uv.es.']","Teresa Ferrer-Blasco, Alberto Domínguez-Vicent, Santiago García-Lázaro, María Amparo Diez, José F Alfonso, José J Esteve-Taboada, ",International ophthalmology,2018 Jun,In vitro optical characterization; Intraocular lenses; Modulation transfer function; Point-spread function.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28444524

      A new three-dimensional heart anatomical simulator (3D HAS) has been created combining a physical heart model with an electroanatomic mapping (EAM) system. The aim of this study is to describe the development and the validation process of this device. Methods:
      
    

    
      We developed the 3D HAS combining a physical heart model with an EAM system. This simulator was then validated by 10 electrophysiologists, subdivided in two groups based on their experience in electrophysiology procedures. The performance of the experts was compared to the one of the novices in achieving three different tasks: fluoroless reconstruction of the right atrium, coronary sinus cannulation, and deployment of a linear ablation lesion in the cavotricuspid isthmus. For each operator, a score was calculated based on objective parameter for each task and for the overall performance. Results:
      
    

    
      The 3D HAS was located in an environment that allowed use of the main features of the EAM system including contact force sensing. No technical issue was encountered during the validation process. The experts' performance was significantly better than the one of the novices both overall (P = 0.009) and in each task (right atrium reconstruction, P = 0.016; coronary sinus cannulation, P = 0.008; ablation lesion, P = 0.03). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The 3D HAS is reliable and allows use of the main features of an EAM system in the right atrium.

Even though cassava has been the focus of several breeding programs and has become a strong focus of research in the last few years, relatively little is currently known about its metabolism and metabolic composition in different tissues. In this article, the absolute content of sugars, organic acids, amino acids, phosphorylated intermediates, minerals, starch, carotenoids, chlorophylls, tocopherols, and total protein as well as starch quality is described based on multiple analytical techniques, with protocols specifically adjusted for material from different cassava tissues.

1185,Neural Parallel Engine: A toolbox for massively parallel neural signal processing,"Background:
      
    

    
      Large-scale neural recordings provide detailed information on neuronal activities and can help elicit the underlying neural mechanisms of the brain. However, the computational burden is also formidable when we try to process the huge data stream generated by such recordings. New method:
      
    

    
      In this study, we report the development of Neural Parallel Engine (NPE), a toolbox for massively parallel neural signal processing on graphical processing units (GPUs). It offers a selection of the most commonly used routines in neural signal processing such as spike detection and spike sorting, including advanced algorithms such as exponential-component-power-component (EC-PC) spike detection and binary pursuit spike sorting. We also propose a new method for detecting peaks in parallel through a parallel compact operation. Results:
      
    

    
      Our toolbox is able to offer a 5× to 110× speedup compared with its CPU counterparts depending on the algorithms. A user-friendly MATLAB interface is provided to allow easy integration of the toolbox into existing workflows. Comparison with existing methods:
      
    

    
      Previous efforts on GPU neural signal processing only focus on a few rudimentary algorithms, are not well-optimized and often do not provide a user-friendly programming interface to fit into existing workflows. There is a strong need for a comprehensive toolbox for massively parallel neural signal processing. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      A new toolbox for massively parallel neural signal processing has been created. It can offer significant speedup in processing signals from large-scale recordings up to thousands of channels.","['1 NUS Graduate School of Integrative Sciences and Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore; Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Minnesota Twin Cities, MN, USA.

1186,Basic Concepts and Validation of Digital PCR Measurements,"Use of digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) technology is rapidly growing and diversifying into a range of areas in life science. The release of dPCR commercial systems has facilitated access, leading to recognition of the potential advantages compared to previous quantitative PCR technologies, and the scope for novel applications. The capability of dPCR to deliver unprecedented levels of precision, accuracy, and resolution in quantification of nucleic acids has triggered a strong interest by academia and the life sciences industry in use of this technology as a molecular diagnostic tool. However, the performance of dPCR, as for a ""classical"" PCR assay, essentially still relies on enzyme-based amplification of nucleic acid using specific reagents and instrumentation. This chapter describes basic concepts, key properties, and important factors to consider for the verification and validation of dPCR measurements.","['1 National Measurement Institute, Lindfield, NSW, Australia.

1187,Profiling the Escherichia coli membrane protein interactome captured in Peptidisc libraries,"Protein-correlation-profiling (PCP), in combination with quantitative proteomics, has emerged as a high-throughput method for the rapid identification of dynamic protein complexes in native conditions. While PCP has been successfully applied to soluble proteomes, characterization of the membrane interactome has lagged, partly due to the necessary use of detergents to maintain protein solubility. Here, we apply the peptidisc, a 'one-size fits all' membrane mimetic, for the capture of the Escherichia coli cell envelope proteome and its high-resolution fractionation in the absence of detergent. Analysis of the SILAC-labeled peptidisc library via PCP allows generation of over 4900 possible binary interactions out of >700,000 random associations. Using well-characterized membrane protein systems such as the SecY translocon, the Bam complex and the MetNI transporter, we demonstrate that our dataset is a useful resource for identifying transient and surprisingly novel protein interactions. For example, we discover a trans-periplasmic supercomplex comprising subunits of the Bam and Sec machineries, including membrane-bound chaperones YfgM and PpiD. We identify RcsF and OmpA as bone fide interactors of BamA, and we show that MetQ association with the ABC transporter MetNI depends on its N-terminal lipid anchor. We also discover NlpA as a novel interactor of MetNI complex. Most of these interactions are largely undetected by standard detergent-based purification. Together, the peptidisc workflow applied to the proteomic field is emerging as a promising novel approach to characterize membrane protein interactions under native expression conditions and without genetic manipulation.","['1 Life Sciences Institute, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.', '2 Michael Smith Laboratory, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.', '3 Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Regina, Regina, Canada.']","Michael Luke Carlson, R Greg Stacey, John William Young, Irvinder Singh Wason, Zhiyu Zhao, David G Rattray, Nichollas Scott, Craig H Kerr, Mohan Babu, Leonard J Foster, Franck Duong Van Hoa, ",eLife,2019,E. coli; Peptidisc; SILAC; SMALPs; biochemistry; chemical biology; computational biology; membrane protein complexes; membrane proteomics; systems biology.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31364989
1188,Kfits: a software framework for fitting and cleaning outliers in kinetic measurements,"Motivation:
      
    

    
      Kinetic measurements have played an important role in elucidating biochemical and biophysical phenomena for over a century. While many tools for analysing kinetic measurements exist, most require low noise levels in the data, leaving outlier measurements to be cleaned manually. This is particularly true for protein misfolding and aggregation processes, which are extremely noisy and hence difficult to model. Understanding these processes is paramount, as they are associated with diverse physiological processes and disorders, most notably neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, a better tool for analysing and cleaning protein aggregation traces is required. Results:
      
    

    
      Here we introduce Kfits, an intuitive graphical tool for detecting and removing noise caused by outliers in protein aggregation kinetics data. Following its workflow allows the user to quickly and easily clean large quantities of data and receive kinetic parameters for assessment of the results. With minor adjustments, the software can be applied to any type of kinetic measurements, not restricted to protein aggregation. Availability and implementation:

In the last 3 years, public data sharing through PRIDE (as part of PX) has definitely become the norm in the field. In parallel, data re-use of public proteomics data has increased enormously, with multiple applications. We first describe the new architecture of PRIDE Archive, the archival component of PRIDE. PRIDE Archive and the related data submission framework have been further developed to support the increase in submitted data volumes and additional data types. A new scalable and fault tolerant storage backend, Application Programming Interface and web interface have been implemented, as a part of an ongoing process.

Beam profiles of 6 MV photons from the Siemens Primus Linear Accelerator were measured with a micro ion chamber (IC CC01, IBA) and linear diode array (LDA-99SC, IBA). Data was acquired using a water phantom for small fields (0.5×0.5 cm2 to 4×4 cm2) at depth of maximum dose, 5 cm and 10 cm. Profiles were also generated with EGSnrc Monte Carlo code. Measured and simulated profiles were compared in terms of percentage difference of the area under the simulated and measured profiles (PD), ratio of the measured to simulated dose at the point of maximum deviation within the central region of profile (R), full width half maximum (FWHM) and penumbra. For field sizes ≥1×1 cm2, the maximum PD is 3.17 % and 2.87 % for IC and LDA respectively, whereas R is in the range of 0.95-1.05 for IC and 0.99-1.05 for LDA.

1194,A biophysical mechanism for preferred direction enhancement in fly motion vision,"Seeing the direction of motion is essential for survival of all sighted animals. Consequently, nerve cells that respond to visual stimuli moving in one but not in the opposite direction, so-called 'direction-selective' neurons, are found abundantly. In general, direction selectivity can arise by either signal amplification for stimuli moving in the cell's preferred direction ('preferred direction enhancement'), signal suppression for stimuli moving along the opposite direction ('null direction suppression'), or a combination of both. While signal suppression can be readily implemented in biophysical terms by a hyperpolarization followed by a rectification corresponding to the nonlinear voltage-dependence of the Calcium channel, the biophysical mechanism for signal amplification has remained unclear so far. Taking inspiration from the fly, I analyze a neural circuit where a direction-selective ON-cell receives inhibitory input from an OFF cell on the preferred side of the dendrite, while excitatory ON-cells contact the dendrite centrally. This way, an ON edge moving along the cell's preferred direction suppresses the inhibitory input, leading to a release from inhibition in the postsynaptic cell. The benefit of such a two-fold signal inversion lies in the resulting increase of the postsynaptic cell's input resistance, amplifying its response to a subsequent excitatory input signal even with a passive dendrite, i.e. without voltage-gated ion channels. A motion detector implementing this mechanism together with null direction suppression shows a high degree of direction selectivity over a large range of temporal frequency, narrow directional tuning, and a large signal-to-noise ratio.","['1 Max-Planck-Institute of Neurobiology, Martinsried, Germany.']","Alexander Borst, ",PLoS computational biology,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29897917

Because perturbations in glycosylation could result in dysfunction of cells and are related to diseases, the analysis of surface glycosylation is critical for understanding pathogenic mechanisms and can further lead to biomarker discovery.

      Mass Spectrometry (MS) is a widely used technique in biology research, and has become key in proteomics and metabolomics analyses. As a result, the amount of MS data has significantly increased in recent years. For example, the MS repository MassIVE contains more than 123TB of data. Somehow surprisingly, these data are stored uncompressed, hence incurring a significant storage cost. Efficient representation of these data is therefore paramount to lessen the burden of storage and facilitate its dissemination. Results:
      
    

    
      We present MassComp, a lossless compressor optimized for the numerical (m/z)-intensity pairs that account for most of the MS data. We tested MassComp on several MS data and show that it delivers on average a 46% reduction on the size of the numerical data, and up to 89%. These results correspond to an average improvement of more than 27% when compared to the general compressor gzip and of 40% when compared to the state-of-the-art numerical compressor FPC. When tested on entire files retrieved from the MassIVE repository, MassComp achieves on average a 59% size reduction. MassComp is written in C++ and freely available at https://github.com/iochoa/MassComp . Conclusions:

1198,MetExpert: An expert system to enhance gas chromatography‒mass spectrometry-based metabolite identifications,"Gas chromatography‒mass spectrometry (GCMS) is an important analytical technique in metabolomics studies and has been routinely used for metabolite profiling of biological samples. Spectral matching to databases of authentic compounds are the preferred tools for metabolite identifications; however, the metabolic coverage of these databases is still limited compared to the number of known metabolites. Several computational tools have been developed to facilitate the interpretation of MS data but unfortunately most of them have limited applicability to GCMS-based metabolite identification. In this paper, we introduce a computer-aided, metabolite expert system called MetExpert which emulates the metabolite-identification ability of a human expert using orthogonal datasets including molecular formulas, retention indices, and EI-MS spectra to characterize the molecular structures. This system integrates four modules including in silico derivatization, metabolite-likeness evaluation, retention prediction, and substructure prediction. In silico derivatization increases the searchable chemical space for TMS-derivatized metabolites many of which are absent in molecular structure databases. Metabolite-likeness evaluations are an efficient approach to select metabolite-like molecules when querying large databases such as PubChem. An artificial neutral network then establishes the quantitative structure‒retention relationships for the accurate prediction of RIs that further refines the candidate molecules. In addition, PLS-DA models establish quantitative structure‒spectra relationships for the prediction of metabolite substructures. Finally, weighted scoring of three orthogonal evaluations increases the identification rates. MetExpert outperformed current state-of-the-art methods such as MetFrag and CFM-ID for ranking the correct identifications. While spectral comparisons with chemical standards or de novo structural elucidations are necessary to validate the predictions, MetExpert provides an efficient and effective approach to prioritize the candidates.","['1 University of Missouri, Department of Biochemistry, Bond Life Sciences Center, 1201 Rollins Street, Columbia, MO 65211, USA.', '2 University of Missouri, Department of Biochemistry, Bond Life Sciences Center, 1201 Rollins Street, Columbia, MO 65211, USA.

External cues may guide behaviour, but they must be interpreted in the context of the animal's own body movements. Mechanosensory cues that can resolve dynamic internal and environmental conditions, like those from vertebrate vestibular systems or other proprioceptors, are essential for guided movement. How do afferent proprioceptor neurons transform movement into a neural code? In flies, modified hindwings known as halteres detect forces produced by body rotations and are essential for flight. However, the mechanisms by which haltere neurons transform forces resulting from three-dimensional body rotations into patterns of neural spikes are unknown. We use intracellular electrodes to record from haltere primary afferent neurons during a range of haltere motions. We find that spike timing activity of individual neurons changes with displacement and propose a mechanism by which single neurons can encode three-dimensional haltere movements during flight.","['1 Department of Biology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.', '2 Department of Biology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA jlf88@case.edu.']","Alexandra M Yarger, Jessica L Fox, ",Proceedings.

      The Metabolomics Standards Initiative has recommended four categories for metabolite assignments in NMR-based metabolic profiling studies. The ""putatively annotated compound"" category is most commonly reported by metabolomics investigators. However, there is significant ambiguity in reliability of ""putatively annotated compound"" assignments, which can range from low confidence made on minimal corroborating data to high confidence made on substantial corroborating data. Objectives:
      
    

    
      To introduce a new ranking system, Rank and AssigN Confidence to Metabolites (RANCM), to assign confidence levels to ""putatively annotated compound"" assignments in NMR-based metabolic profiling studies. Methods:
      
    

    
      The ranking system was constructed with three confidence levels ranging from Rank 1 for the lowest confidence assignment level to Rank 3 for the highest confidence assignment level. A decision tree was constructed to guide rank selection for each metabolite assignment. Results:
      
    

    
      Examples are provided from experimental data demonstrating how to use the decision tree to make confidence level assignments to ""putatively annotated compounds"" in each of the three rank levels. A standard Excel sheet template is provided to facilitate decision-making, documentation and submission to data repositories. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      RANCM is intended to reduce the ambiguity in ""putatively annotated compound"" assignments, to facilitate effective communication of the degree of confidence in ""putatively annotated compound"" assignments, and to make it easier for non-experts to evaluate the significance and reliability of NMR-based metabonomics studies.

Here, we describe an effective method for cell type-selective glycomic profiling of tissue fragments collected by laser microdissection (LMD) under fluorescent histochemical visualization. We optimized each step of histochemical staining and confirmed the reliability and validity of glycomic profiling. Using the optimized procedure, glycomic profiles were obtained with 0.5 mm² of stained thymic sections (5-μm-thick) from 8-week-old C57BL/6J male mice. The glycomic profiles of Ulex europaeus agglutinin-I (UEA-I)-stained medullary regions showed higher UEA-I signals than those of the morphologically determined medulla regions, indicating the utility of this method for UEA-I(+) cell-selective analysis. To further evaluate this method, tissue fragments was serially collected from stained and unstained areas of medullary epithelial cell probes (UEA-I and anti-cytokeratin 5 antibody) and a cortex-staining probe (peanut agglutinin). The medullary regions assigned by the three probes showed significantly different glycomic profiles, highlighting the difference in subpopulation recognition among the three probes, which was consistent with previous reports.

      Nanochambers present some advantages in terms of energy independence and absolute dose measurement for small field dosimetry in the SBRT scenario. Characterization of a micro-chamber prototype was carried out both under flattened and flattening-filter-free (FFF) beams with particular focus on stem effect. Methods:
      
    

    
      The study included characterization of leakage and stem effects, dose rate and dose per pulse dependence, measurement of profiles, and percentage depth doses (PDDs). Ion collection efficiency and polarity effects were measured and evaluated against field size and dose per pulse. The 6_MV, 6_MV_FFF and 10_MV FFF beams of a Varian EDGE were used. Output factors were measured for field sizes ranging from 0.8×0.8cm2 to 20×20cm2 and were compared with other detectors. Results:
      
    

    
      The 2mm diameter of this chamber guarantees a high spatial resolution with low penumbra values. In orthogonal configuration a strong stem (and cable) effect was observed for small fields. Dose rate and dose per pulse dependence were <0.3% and 0.6% respectively for the whole range of considered values. The Nanochamber exhibits a field size (FS) dependence of the polarity correction >2%. The OF values were compared with other small field detectors showing a good agreement for field sizes >2×2cm2. The large field over-response was corrected applying kpol(FS). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Nanochamber is an interesting option for small field measurements. The spherical shape of the active volume is an advantage in terms of reduced angular dependence. An interesting feature of the Nanochamber is its beam quality independence and, as a future development, the possibility to use it for small field absolute dosimetry.","['1 Physics Service of Radiation Oncology Dept., Humanitas Clinical and Research Hospital, Milan-Rozzano, Italy.

1203,Comprehensive metabolomic and proteomic analysis in biochemical metabolic pathways of rice spikes under drought and submergence stress,"Drought and submergence are the main adverse factors affecting plant growth and yield formation in parts of China, especially in the Yangtze River region. In this study, T1 (drought duration: 10 d), T2 (submergence duration: 8 d) and CK (control) treatments were applied. This work aimed to study the changes in metabolic pathways of rice under drought and submergence stress during the panicle differentiation stage. The identification and analysis of differential metabolites and differentially expressed proteins functions indicate that drought and submergence mainly promoted the energy metabolism pathway, carbon fixation in photosynthetic organism pathway, carbohydrate metabolic process, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolic process functions. Under drought stress, the inhibition of photosynthetic rate is mainly through stomatal conductance restriction, and flavonoid pathway regulates the metabolic process of ROS. Under submergence stress, the electron transfer chain was destroyed to inhibit the photosynthetic rate, and the antioxidant system was activated to regulate the metabolism of ROS. The changes in related enzymes or proteins in metabolic regulatory networks are analyzed, which will be conducive to understanding the response mechanism of rice drought and submergence more deeply and provide a scientific basis for rice drought and submergence prevention and mitigation, and the breeding of drought- and submergence-resistant varieties.","['1 Key Laboratory of Crop Physiology, Ecology and Genetic Breeding, Ministry of Education, College of Agronomy, Jiangxi Agricultural University, Jiangxi 330045, China.', '2 Key Laboratory of Crop Physiology, Ecology and Genetic Breeding, Ministry of Education, College of Agronomy, Jiangxi Agricultural University, Jiangxi 330045, China.

SRM has the advantage of being able to quantify a range of proteins in a single analysis, for example, to measure the level of enzymes comprising a biochemical pathway. In this chapter, we will detail how to set up an SRM assay on the example of the mitochondrial protein succinate dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] flavoprotein subunit (mouse UniProt-code Q8K2B3). First, we will outline the in silico assay design including the choice of peptides based on a range of properties. We will further delineate different quantification strategies and introduce the reader to LC-MS assay development including the selection of the optimal peptide charge state and fragment ions as well as a discussion of the dynamic range of detection.

Forward model which describes the photon propagation within a biological tissue is a prerequisite for implementing FDOT and determines the performance of FDOT. To further improve the efficiency of FDOT, this paper proposes a new forward model based on the Lattice Boltzmann (LB) method derived from the discretization of radiation transfer equation and applies it to FDOT. The experimental results of numerical simulation and physical phantom show that the LB-based forward model proposed in this paper can increase the imaging speed of FDOT by about 5 times compared with the traditional diffusion equation method, without reducing its imaging quality.","['1 School of Communication and Information Engineering, Shanghai University, Shanghai, 200444.', '2 Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Shanghai University, Shanghai, 200444.']","Xingxing Cen, Zhuangzhi Yan, ",Zhongguo yi liao qi xie za zhi = Chinese journal of medical instrumentation,2019,Fluorescence Diffuse Optical Tomography; Lattice Boltzmann method; forward model.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31854520
1210,Omics-based Biomarkers for the Early Alzheimer Disease Diagnosis and Reliable Therapeutic Targets Development,"Background:
      
    

    
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia in adulthood, has great medical, social, and economic impact worldwide. Available treatments result in symptomatic relief, and most of them are indicated from the early stages of the disease. Therefore, there is an increasing body of research developing accurate and early diagnoses, as well as diseasemodifying therapies. Objective:
      
    

    
      Advancing the knowledge of AD physiopathological mechanisms, improving early diagnosis and developing effective treatments from omics-based biomarkers. Methods:
      
    

    
      Studies using omics technologies to detect early AD, were reviewed with a particular focus on the metabolites/lipids, micro-RNAs and proteins, which are identified as potential biomarkers in non-invasive samples. Results:
      
    

    
      This review summarizes recent research on metabolomics/lipidomics, epigenomics and proteomics, applied to early AD detection. Main research lines are the study of metabolites from pathways, such as lipid, amino acid and neurotransmitter metabolisms, cholesterol biosynthesis, and Krebs and urea cycles. In addition, some microRNAs and proteins (microglobulins, interleukins), related to a common network with amyloid precursor protein and tau, have been also identified as potential biomarkers. Nevertheless, the reproducibility of results among studies is not good enough and a standard methodological approach is needed in order to obtain accurate information. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The assessment of metabolomic/lipidomic, epigenomic and proteomic changes associated with AD to identify early biomarkers in non-invasive samples from well-defined participants groups will potentially allow the advancement in the early diagnosis and improvement of therapeutic interventions.","['1 Neonatal Research Unit, Health Research Institute La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', '2 Neurology Unit, University and Polytechnic Hospital La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', '3 Division of Neonatology, University and Polytechnic Hospital La Fe, Valencia, Spain.']","Carmen Peña-Bautista, Miguel Baquero, Máximo Vento, Consuelo Cháfer-Pericás, ",Current neuropharmacology,2019,Alzheimer disease; Metabolomics; biomarkers; epigenomics; lipidomics; mild cognitive impairment; proteomics..,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30255758

Although eggs can be accumulated for short periods of time, IgY must be isolated from the yolk within 2-3 wk to avoid fouling of the material. In the first section of this protocol, sodium sulfate is used to precipitate protein fractions differentially from the chicken egg yolk.

1212,Time-resolved decoding of metabolic signatures of in vitro growth of the hemibiotrophic pathogen Colletotrichum sublineolum,"Metabolomics has emerged as a powerful approach to comprehensively interrogate cellular biochemistry. As such, we applied an untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolomic strategy to elucidate metabolome changes in the anthracnose-causing hemibiotrophic sorghum pathogen, Colletotrichum sublineolum. An in vitro batch culture study model with different carbon sources, glucose, arabinose and rhamnose, were used to support fungal growth over a period of twelve days. Metabolites representing the intracellular and extracellular (secreted) metabolomes were extracted with methanol and subjected to LC-MS analyses. Chemometric modelling revealed a metabolic variation trajectory, comprising three distinct stages that metabolically describe the adaptation of the fungus to diminishing nutrients. Selected marker gene expression indicated stage one (0-3 d.p.i) as corresponding to the early logarithmic phase. Stage two can be interpreted as an intermediate transitionary stage with stage three corresponding to the stationary phase (9-12 d.p.i). Stage one was characterised by up-regulation of endo-metabolites such as ferricrocin, fatty acids and flavone-conjugates, while stage three was characterised by the secretion of phytotoxins, including colletotrichin and colletotric acid. Ultimately, results from our in vitro model reveal previously unknown insights into the dynamic aspects of metabolome reprogramming in the growth phases of Colletotrichum spp as determined by nutrients obtainable from plant cell walls.","['1 Centre for Plant Metabolomics, Department of Biochemistry, University of Johannesburg, Auckland Park, Johannesburg, South Africa.', '2 Department of Clinical Cancer Prevention, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Centre, 1515 Holcombe Blvd., Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', '3 Centre for Plant Metabolomics, Department of Biochemistry, University of Johannesburg, Auckland Park, Johannesburg, South Africa. idubery@uj.ac.za.']","Fidele Tugizimana, Arnaud T Djami-Tchatchou, Johannes F Fahrmann, Paul A Steenkamp, Lizelle A Piater, Ian A Dubery, ",Scientific reports,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30824820
1213,"Effect of temporally heterogeneous light on photosynthetic light use efficiency, plant acclimation and growth in Abatia parviflora","Individual leaves have a unique instantaneous photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) at which net photosynthetic light use efficiency (ϵL, the ratio between net photosynthesis and PPFD) is maximised (PPFDϵmax). When PPFD is above or below PPFDϵmax, efficiency declines. Thus, we hypothesised that heterogeneous PPFD conditions should increase the amount of time leaves photosynthesise at a PPFD different than PPFDϵmax and result in reduced growth. To date, this prediction has not been rigorously tested. Here, we exposed seedlings of Abatia parviflora Ruiz & Pav to light regimes of equal total daily irradiance but with three different daily time courses of PPFD: constant PPFD (No_H), low heterogeneity (Low_H) and high heterogeneity (High_H). Mean ϵL, leaf daily photosynthesis and plant growth were all significantly higher in No_H and Low_H plants than in High_H plants, supporting our hypothesis. In addition, mean ϵL was positively related to final plant biomass. Unexpectedly, High_H plants had more etiolated stems and more horizontal leaves than No_H and Low_H plants, possibly due to exposure to low PPFD in the morning and afternoon. In conclusion, PPFD heterogeneity had an important effect on average ϵL, photosynthesis and growth, but also on allocation and plant morphology.","['1 Programa de Biología, Facultad de Ciencias Naturales y Matemáticas, Universidad del Rosario, Cr. 24 # 63C-69, Bogotá, DC 111221, Colombia; and Department of Civil, Environmental and Geodetic Engineering.

1214,Standardized assays for determining the catalytic activity and kinetics of peroxidase-like nanozymes,"Nanozymes are nanomaterials exhibiting intrinsic enzyme-like characteristics that have increasingly attracted attention, owing to their high catalytic activity, low cost and high stability. This combination of properties has enabled a broad spectrum of applications, ranging from biological detection assays to disease diagnosis and biomedicine development.

Given the complex interdependence of the physicochemical properties and catalytic characteristics of nanozymes, it is important to establish a standard by which the catalytic activities and kinetics of various nanozymes can be quantitatively compared and that will benefit the development of nanozyme-based detection and diagnostic technologies. Here, we first present a protocol for measuring and defining the catalytic activity units and kinetics for peroxidase nanozymes, the most widely used type of nanozyme. In addition, we describe the detailed experimental procedures for a typical nanozyme strip-based biological detection test and demonstrate that nanozyme-based detection is repeatable and reliable when guided by the presented nanozyme catalytic standard.

Long term natural and anthropogenic activities have increased arsenic levels in groundwater causing higher threats of arsenic exposure. Arsenic hyper-tolerant Firmicute Bacillus firmus L-148 was isolated from arsenic limiting Lonar lake soil, which tolerated more than 3 M arsenic and could oxidize 75 mM arsenite [As(III)] in 14 days. It oxidized As(III) in presence of heavy metals and had unusual pH optima at 9.2. B. firmus L-148 was studied at the biochemical, protein, genomic and transcript level for understanding its arsenic oxidizing machinery. The proteomic and transcript analysis exhibited the presence of ars and aio operon and supported the inducible nature of ars operon. Robust, hyper-tolerant, fast As(III) oxidizing, least nutrient requiring and multi-metal resistance qualities of the strain were used in microcosm studies for bioremediation.

1224,Global responses to tris(1-chloro-2-propyl)phosphate (TCPP) in rockfish Sebastes schlegeli using integrated proteomic and metabolomic approach,"As alternatives of brominated flame retardants, organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) can be detected in multiple marine environmental media. Tris(1-chloro-2-propyl)phosphate (TCPP) was one of the most frequently and abundantly detected OPFRs in the Bohai Sea. Exposure to TCPP has been shown to induce abnormal behavior in zebrafish as well as neurotoxicity in Caenorhabditis elegans. However, there is a lack of mechanism investigations on the toxic effects of TCPP at molecular levels. In this work, proteomics and metabolomics were integrated to analyze the proteome and metabolome responses in rockfish Sebastes schlegeli treated with TCPP (10 and 100 nM) for 15 days. A total of 143 proteins and 8 metabolites were significantly altered in rockfish following TCPP treatments. The responsive proteins and metabolites were predominantly involved in neurotransmission, neurodevelopment, signal transduction, cellular transport, cholesterol metabolism, bile acid synthesis, and detoxification. Furthermore, a hypothesized network of proteins, metabolites, and pathways in rockfish was summarized based on the combination of proteomic and metabolomic results, showing some key molecular events in response to TCPP. Overall, the present study unraveled the molecular responses at protein and metabolite levels, which provided a better understanding of toxicological effects and mechanisms of TCPP in marine teleost.","['1 CAS Key Laboratory of Coastal Environmental Processes and Ecological Remediation, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research (YIC), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Shandong Key Laboratory of Coastal Environmental Processes, YICCAS, Yantai 264003, PR China; Laboratory for Marine Fisheries Science and Food Production Processes, Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology, Qingdao 266237, PR China; Center for Ocean Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Qingdao 266071, PR China.', '2 CAS Key Laboratory of Coastal Environmental Processes and Ecological Remediation, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research (YIC), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Shandong Key Laboratory of Coastal Environmental Processes, YICCAS, Yantai 264003, PR China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, PR China.', '3 CAS Key Laboratory of Coastal Environmental Processes and Ecological Remediation, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research (YIC), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Shandong Key Laboratory of Coastal Environmental Processes, YICCAS, Yantai 264003, PR China; Center for Ocean Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Qingdao 266071, PR China.', '4 Laboratory for Marine Fisheries Science and Food Production Processes, Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology, Qingdao 266237, PR China.', '5 CAS Key Laboratory of Coastal Environmental Processes and Ecological Remediation, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research (YIC), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Shandong Key Laboratory of Coastal Environmental Processes, YICCAS, Yantai 264003, PR China; Laboratory for Marine Fisheries Science and Food Production Processes, Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology, Qingdao 266237, PR China; Center for Ocean Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Qingdao 266071, PR China.

1225,Creative use of analytical techniques and high-throughput technology to facilitate safety assessment of engineered nanomaterials,"With the rapid development and numerous applications of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) in science and technology, their impact on environmental health and safety should be considered carefully. This requires an effective platform to investigate the potential adverse effects and hazardous biological outcomes of numerous nanomaterials and their formulations. We consider predictive toxicology a rational approach for this effort, which utilizes mechanism-based in vitro high-throughput screening (HTS) to make predictions on ENMs' adverse outcomes in vivo. Moreover, this approach is able to link the physicochemical properties of ENMs to toxicity that allows the development of structure-activity relationships (SARs). To build this predictive platform, extensive analytical and bioanalytical techniques and tools are required. In this review, we described the predictive toxicology approach and the accompanying analytical and bioanalytical techniques.

Technological and intellectual advances in the last two decades have enabled chemical signals analyses at several molecular levels, including gene expression, molecular diversity, and receptor affinity. These advances have also deepened our understanding of nature to encompass interactions at multiple organism levels across different taxa. This tutorial review describes the most recent analytical developments in 'omics' technologies (i.e., genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) and provide recent examples of its application in studies of chemical signals. We highlight how studies have integrated an enormous amount of information generated from different omics disciplines into one publicly available platform. In addition, we stress the importance of considering different signal modalities and an evolutionary perspective to establish a comprehensive understanding of chemical communication.","['1 Physics and Chemistry Department, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ribeirão Preto, University of São Paulo, Ribeirão Preto, SP, 14040-903, Brazil. npelopes@fcfrp.usp.br.']","A E Brunetti, F Carnevale Neto, M C Vera, C Taboada, D P Pavarini, A Bauermeister, N P Lopes, ",Chemical Society reviews,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29114668
1227,An Interfacial Sodium Ion is an Essential Structural Feature of Fluc Family Fluoride Channels,"Fluc family fluoride channels are assembled as primitive antiparallel homodimers. Crystallographic studies revealed a cation bound at the center of the protein, where it is coordinated at the dimer interface by main chain carbonyl oxygen atoms from the midmembrane breaks in two corresponding transmembrane helices. Here, we show that this cation is a stably bound sodium ion, and although it is not a transported substrate, its presence is required for the channel to adopt an open, fluoride-conducting conformation. The interfacial site is selective for sodium over other cations, except for Li+, which competes with Na+ for binding, but does not support channel activity. The strictly structural role fulfilled by this sodium provides new context to understand the structures, mechanisms, and evolutionary origins of widespread Na+-coupled transporters.","['1 Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.', '2 Program in Biophysics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.', '3 Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA; Program in Biophysics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.

1228,Attitude of Jordanian Physicians toward Biochemistry and Genetics,"Background:
      
    

    
      Several studies found that physicians develop a negative attitude toward biochemistry and genetics disciplines. Many medical schools adopt an integrated system-based curriculum supplemented with clinical correlations. Medical schools in Jordan switched to the integrated curriculum; however, studies that evaluate the attitude of physicians toward biochemistry and genetics are lacking. Objectives:
      
    

    
      This study aimed to evaluate the attitude of physicians toward biochemistry and genetics including the correlation of their curricula with clinical practice. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      A structured questionnaire consisting of 40 statements was distributed to a random sample of 616 physicians practicing in private and governmental hospitals in Jordan. Participants earned their MD or MBBS degree from Jordan or other countries and were interns, residents, or specialists. Results:
      
    

    
      More than half of the participants admitted that biochemistry and genetics are intellectually challenging and were among their least favourite subjects (59.1%); however, many of them were familiar with some of the contemporary advances in biochemistry and genetics and their translational potential (64.0%). Most of the participants felt that modifying the medical school curriculum by integrating biochemical and genetic concepts with clinical teaching will motivate the medical students (74%). In univariate analysis, residents showed the most positive attitudes and were the most knowledgeable about the biochemical changes associated with diseases and about the contemporary advances in biochemistry or genetics (P < 0.05). In multivariate analysis, physicians practicing in the private sector or those with more than five years of experience generally had a more positive attitude toward biochemistry and genetics (P < 0.05). Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Physicians in Jordan showed an overall positive attitude toward biochemistry and genetics.

1229,Facilitating chemical and biochemical experiments with electronic microcontrollers and single-board computers,"Since the advent of modern science, researchers have had to rely on their technical skills or the support of specialized workshops to construct analytical instruments. The notion of the 'fourth industrial revolution' promotes construction of customized systems by individuals using widely available, inexpensive electronic modules. This protocol shows how chemists and biochemists can utilize a broad range of microcontroller boards (MCBs) and single-board computers (SBCs) to improve experimental designs and address scientific questions. We provide seven example procedures for laboratory routines that can be expedited by implementing this technology: (i) injection of microliter-volume liquid plugs into microscale capillaries for low-volume assays; (ii) transfer of liquid extract to a mass spectrometer; (iii) liquid-gas extraction of volatile organic compounds (called 'fizzy extraction'), followed by mass spectrometric detection; (iv) monitoring of experimental conditions over the Internet cloud in real time; (v) transfer of analytes to a mass spectrometer via a liquid microjunction interface, data acquisition, and data deposition into the Internet cloud; (vi) feedback control of a biochemical reaction; and (vii) optimization of sample flow rate in direct-infusion mass spectrometry. The protocol constitutes a primer for chemists and biochemists who would like to take advantage of MCBs and SBCs in daily experimentation. It is assumed that the readers have not attended any courses related to electronics or programming.

In addition, it is often desirable to know which features of the stimulus or response are most informative. The literature offers several different decompositions of the mutual information into its stimulus or response-specific components, such as the specific surprise or the uncertainty reduction, but the number of mutually distinct measures is in fact infinite. We resolve this ambiguity by requiring the specific information measures to be invariant under invertible coordinate transformations of the stimulus and the response ensembles. We prove that the Kullback-Leibler divergence is then the only suitable measure of the specific information. On a more general level, we discuss the necessity and the fundamental aspects of the coordinate invariance as a selection principle. We believe that our results will encourage further research into invariant statistical methods for the analysis of neural coding.","['1 Institute of Physiology, Czech Academy of Sciences, Videnska 1083, 14220, Prague 4, Czech Republic. kostal@biomed.cas.cz.', '2 Institute of Physiology, Czech Academy of Sciences, Videnska 1083, 14220, Prague 4, Czech Republic.']","Lubomir Kostal, Giuseppe D'Onofrio, ",Biological cybernetics,2018 Apr,Coordinate invariance; Kullback–Leibler divergence; Mutual information; Specific information.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28856427
1231,Ontologically simple theories do not indicate the true nature of complex biological systems: three test cases,"A longstanding philosophical premise perceives simplicity as a desirable attribute of scientific theories. One of several raised justifications for this notion is that simple theories are more likely to indicate the true makeup of natural systems. Qualitatively parsimonious hypotheses and theories keep to a minimum the number of different postulated entities within a system. Formulation of such ontologically simple working hypotheses proved to be useful in the experimental probing of narrowly defined bio systems. It is less certain, however, whether qualitatively parsimonious theories are effective indicators of the true nature of complex biological systems. This paper assesses the success of ontologically simple theories in envisaging the makeup of three complex systems in bacteriology, immunology, and molecular biology. Evidence shows that parsimonious theories completely misconstrued the actual ontologically complex constitutions of the three examined systems. Since evolution and selective pressures typically produce ontologically intricate rather than simple bio systems, qualitatively parsimonious theories are mostly inapt indicators of the true nature of complex biological systems.","['1 Department of Biochemistry, Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, POB 9649, 31096, Bat Galim, Haifa, Israel. mickey@technion.ac.il.']","Michael Fry, ",History and philosophy of the life sciences,2020,Antibody formation; Bacterial diversity; Ockham’s Razor; Protein biosynthesis; Qualitative ontology; Simple theories.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32346811
1232,Current Status and Future Opportunities of Omics Tools in Mycotoxin Research,"Mycotoxins are toxic secondary metabolites of low molecular weight produced by filamentous fungi, such as Aspergillus, Fusarium, and Penicillium spp. Mycotoxins are natural contaminants of agricultural commodities and their prevalence may increase due to global warming. Dangerous mycotoxins cause a variety of health problems not only for humans, but also for animals. For instance, they possess carcinogenic, immunosuppressive, hepatotoxic, nephrotoxic, and neurotoxic effects. Hence, various approaches have been used to assess and control mycotoxin contamination. Significant challenges still exist because of the complex heterogeneous nature of food composition. The potential of combined omics approaches such as metabolomics, genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics would contribute to our understanding about pathogen fungal crosstalk as well as strengthen our ability to identify, isolate, and characterise mycotoxins pre and post-harvest. Multi-omics approaches along with advanced analytical tools and chemometrics provide a complete annotation of such metabolites produced before/during the contamination of crops. We have assessed the merits of these individual and combined omics approaches and their promising applications to mitigate the issue of mycotoxin contamination. The data included in this review focus on aflatoxin, ochratoxin, and patulin and would be useful as benchmark information for future research.","['1 School of Computing, Engineering, & Physical Sciences, University of the West of Scotland, Paisley PA1 2BE, UK. m.eshelli@hotmail.com.', '2 Food Science and Technology Department, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Tripoli, Tripoli 13538, Libya. m.eshelli@hotmail.com.', '3 School of Computing, Engineering, & Physical Sciences, University of the West of Scotland, Paisley PA1 2BE, UK. mallique.qader@gmail.com.', '4 National Institute of Fundamental Studies, Hantana Road, Kandy 20000, Sri Lanka. mallique.qader@gmail.com.', '5 Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Science, Girls Section, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21551, Saudi Arabia. ejjambi@Kau.edu.sa.', '6 School of Computing, Engineering, & Physical Sciences, University of the West of Scotland, Paisley PA1 2BE, UK. andrew.hursthouse@uws.ac.uk.', '7 School of Computing, Engineering, & Physical Sciences, University of the West of Scotland, Paisley PA1 2BE, UK. m.rateb11@aberdeen.ac.uk.']","Manal Eshelli, M Mallique Qader, Ebtihaj J Jambi, Andrew S Hursthouse, Mostafa E Rateb, ",Toxins,2018,Aflatoxin; LC-HRMS; LC-MS/MS; genomic; metabolomics; ochratoxin; patulin; proteomics; transcriptomics.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30373184
1233,Transcriptomic and proteomic choreography in response to light quality variation reveals key adaption mechanisms in marine Nannochloropsis oceanica,"Photosynthetic organisms need to respond frequently to the fluctuation of light quality and light quantity in their habitat. In response to the fluctuation of different single wavelength lights, these organisms have to adjust and optimize the employment of light energy by redistributing excitation energy and remodeling photosystem stoichiometry or light complex structure. However, the response of whole cellular processes to fluctuations in single wavelength light is mostly unknown. Here, we report the transcriptomic and proteomic dynamics and metabolic adaptation mechanisms of Nannochloropsis oceanica to blue and red light. Preferential exposure to different light spectra induces massive reprogramming of the Nannochloropsis transcriptome and proteome. Combined with physiological and biochemical investigation, the rewiring of many cellular processes was observed, including carbon/nitrogen assimilation, photosynthesis, chlorophyll and cartenoid biosynthesis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging systems, and chromatin state regulation. A strong and rapid regulation of genes or proteins related to nitrogen metabolism, photosynthesis, chlorophyll synthesis, ROS scavenging system, and carotenoid metabolism were observed during 12 h and 24 h of exposure under red light. Additionally, two light harvesting complex proteins induced by blue light and one by red light were observed. The differential responses of N. oceanica to red and blue irradiation reveal how marine microalgae adapt to change in light quality and can be exploited for biofuel feedstock development.","['1 Single-Cell Center, CAS Key Laboratory of Biofuels and Shandong Key Laboratory of Energy Genetics, Qingdao Institute of BioEnergy and Bioprocess Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Qingdao, Shandong 266101, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.

The development of soft ionization techniques was central to the application of MS to large biological molecules and led to an unprecedented interest in the study of biomolecules such as proteins (proteomics), metabolites (metabolomics), carbohydrates (glycomics), and lipids (lipidomics), allowing a better understanding of the molecular underpinnings of health and disease. The interest in large molecules drove improvements in MS resolution and now the challenge is in data deconvolution, intelligent exploitation of heterogeneous data, and interpretation, all of which can be ameliorated with a proposed IMass technology. We define IMass as a combination of MS and artificial intelligence, with each performing a specific role.

Data resulting from these studies provide unique insights into physiologic properties of human neuronal microcircuits. However, substantial limitations still remain with this approach. First, the tissue is always resected from patients, never from healthy controls. Second, the patient population undergoing brain surgery with tissue resection is limited to epilepsy and tumor patients - never from patients with other neurologic disorders. Third, the vast majority of tissue resected is limited largely to temporal cortex and hippocampus, occasionally amygdala. Therefore, the possibility to study brain tissue: (1) from healthy controls; (2) from patients with different neuropathologies; (3) from different brain areas; and (4) from a wide spectrum of ages only exists through autopsy-derived brain tissue.

1239,Flow-accelerated platelet biogenesis is due to an elasto-hydrodynamic instability,"Blood platelets are formed by fragmentation of long membrane extensions from bone marrow megakaryocytes in the blood flow. Using lattice-Boltzmann/immersed boundary simulations we propose a biological Rayleigh-Plateau instability as the biophysical mechanism behind this fragmentation process. This instability is akin to the surface tension-induced breakup of a liquid jet but is driven by active cortical processes including actomyosin contractility and microtubule sliding. Our fully three-dimensional simulations highlight the crucial role of actomyosin contractility, which is required to trigger the instability, and illustrate how the wavelength of the instability determines the size of the final platelets. The elasto-hydrodynamic origin of the fragmentation explains the strong acceleration of platelet biogenesis in the presence of an external flow, which we observe in agreement with experiments. Our simulations then allow us to disentangle the influence of specific flow conditions: While a homogeneous flow with uniform velocity leads to the strongest acceleration, a shear flow with a linear velocity gradient can cause fusion events of two developing platelet-sized swellings during fragmentation. A fusion event may lead to the release of larger structures which are observable as preplatelets in experiments. Together, our findings strongly indicate a mainly physical origin of fragmentation and regulation of platelet size in flow-accelerated platelet biogenesis.","['1 Biofluid Simulation and Modeling, Theoretische Physik VI, University of Bayreuth, 95447 Bayreuth, Germany; christian.baecher@uni-bayreuth.de stephan.gekle@uni-bayreuth.de.', '2 Institute of Experimental Biomedicine I, University Hospital and Rudolf Virchow Center, 97080 Würzburg, Germany.']","Christian Bächer, Markus Bender, Stephan Gekle, ",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2020,Rayleigh–Plateau instability; actomyosin contractility; biophysics; blood flow; blood platelet biogenesis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32719144
1240,Allbutt of Leeds and Duchenne de Boulogne: Newly discovered insights on Duchenne by a British neuropsychiatrist,"It is well-established that Guillaume-Benjamin-Amand Duchenne de Boulogne (1806-1875), and Jean-Martin Charcot (1825-1893) were the founding fathers of Parisian and French neurology during the second half of the 19th century, although much more is known about Charcot than about his ""master"" Duchenne. In Britain, Thomas Clifford Allbutt (1836-1925) was Leeds' most distinguished physician of the 19th century, eventually becoming Regius Professor of Physic at Cambridge. Allbutt's 1860-1861 year of postgraduate study in Paris and his friendship with Duchenne profoundly influenced his own contributions to nervous system and mental diseases, partly in collaboration with his colleague James Crichton-Browne (1840-1938) at the nearby West Riding Lunatic Asylum in Wakefield, Yorkshire. The present report briefly recalls the careers of Duchenne and Allbutt, and also presents a unique account by Allbutt of Duchenne in action at the height of his powers, investigating and defining the previously uncharted field of neuromuscular diseases with the aid of his localized electrization techniques. This account is discussed in relation to: Duchenne's personality and pioneering neurological achievements; the origins of French neurology; and the development of Anglo-French neurological relationships during the 19th century. Interestingly, both Duchenne and Crichton-Browne separately made important and much-appreciated contributions to the third major book by Charles Darwin (1809-1882), The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, published in 1872.","['1 Department of clinical neurosciences, Kings College, Denmark Hill, London SE5 9RS, UK.', '2 Service de neurologie C, Hôpital neurologique Pierre-Wertheimer, Hospices Civils de Lyon, 69677 Bron, France; Centre de neurosciences cognitives Marc-Jeannerod, CNRS UMR 52-29, Faculté de médecine Lyon-Sud-Charles-Mérieux, Université Claude-Bernard-Lyon\xa01, 59, boulevard Pinel, 69677 Bron, France.

1241,Creation and implementation of a flipped jigsaw activity to stimulate interest in biochemistry among medical students,"Learner-centered pedagogical methods that are based on clinical application of basic science concepts through active learning and problem solving are shown to be effective for improving knowledge retention. As the clinical relevance of biochemistry is not always apparent to health-profession students, effective teaching of medical biochemistry should highlight the implications of biochemical concepts in pathology, minimize memorization, and make the concepts memorable for long-term retention. Here, we report the creation and successful implementation of a flipped jigsaw activity that was developed to stimulate interest in learning biochemistry among medical students. The activity combined the elements of a flipped classroom for learning concepts followed by a jigsaw activity to retrieve these concepts by solving clinical cases, answering case-based questions, and creating concept maps. The students' reception of the activity was very positive. They commented that the activity provided them an opportunity to review and synthesize information, helped to gage their learning by applying this information and work with peers. Students' improved performance especially for answering the comprehension-based questions correctly in the postquiz as well as the depth of information included in the postquiz concept maps suggested that the activity helped them to understand how different clinical scenarios develop owing to deviations in basic biochemical pathways. Although this activity was created for medical students, the format of this activity can also be useful for other health-professional students as well as undergraduate and graduate students. © 2018 by The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 46:343-353, 2018.","['1 Department of Biomedical Sciences, Cooper Medical School of Rowan University, Camden, New Jersey 08103.']","Charlene Williams, Susan Perlis, John Gaughan, Sangita Phadtare, ",Biochemistry and molecular biology education : a bimonthly publication of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,2018 Jul,Active learning; medical biochemistry; medical education.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29732677
1242,GMSimpute: a generalized two-step Lasso approach to impute missing values in label-free mass spectrum analysis,"Motivation:
      
    

    
      Missingness in label-free mass spectrometry is inherent to the technology. A computational approach to recover missing values in metabolomics and proteomics datasets is important. Most existing methods are designed under a particular assumption, either missing at random or under the detection limit. If the missing pattern deviates from the assumption, it may lead to biased results. Hence, we investigate the missing patterns in free mass spectrometry data and develop an omnibus approach GMSimpute, to allow effective imputation accommodating different missing patterns. Results:
      
    

    
      Three proteomics datasets and one metabolomics dataset indicate missing values could be a mixture of abundance-dependent and abundance-independent missingness. We assess the performance of GMSimpute using simulated data (with a wide range of 80 missing patterns) and metabolomics data from the Cancer Genome Atlas breast cancer and clear cell renal cell carcinoma studies. Using Pearson correlation and normalized root mean square errors between the true and imputed abundance, we compare its performance to K-nearest neighbors' type approaches, Random Forest, GSimp, a model-based method implemented in DanteR and minimum values. The results indicate GMSimpute provides higher accuracy in imputation and exhibits stable performance across different missing patterns. In addition, GMSimpute is able to identify the features in downstream differential expression analysis with high accuracy when applied to the Cancer Genome Atlas datasets.

1243,The Omics Revolution Continues: The Maturation of High-Throughput Biological Data Sources,"Objective:
      
    

    
       The aim is to provide a comprehensive review of state-of-the art omics approaches, including proteomics, metabolomics, cell-free DNA, and patient cohort matching algorithms in precision oncology. Methods:
      
    

    
       In the past several years, the cancer informatics revolution has been the beneficiary of a data explosion. Different complementary omics technologies have begun coming into their own to provide a more nuanced view of the patient-tumor interaction beyond that of DNA alterations. A combined approach is beneficial to the patient as nearly all new cancer therapeutics are designed with an omics biomarker in mind. Proteomics and metabolomics provide us with a means of assaying in real-time the response of the tumor to treatment. Circulating cell-free DNA may allow us to better understand tumor heterogeneity and interactions with the host genome. Results:
      
    

    
       Integration of increasingly available omics data increases our ability to segment patients into smaller and smaller cohorts, thereby prompting a shift in our thinking about how to use these omics data. With large repositories of patient omics-outcomes data being generated, patient cohort matching algorithms have become a dominant player. Conclusions:
      
    

    
       The continued promise of precision oncology is to select patients who are most likely to benefit from treatment and to avoid toxicity for those who will not. The increased public availability of omics and outcomes data in patients, along with improved computational methods and resources, are making precision oncology a reality.","['1 Department of Biomedical Informatics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', '2 Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', '3 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.']","Ewy Mathé, John L Hays, Daniel G Stover, James L Chen, ",Yearbook of medical informatics,2018 Aug,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30157526

1246,Demonstrating specificity of bioactive peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) targeting microRNAs for practical laboratory classes of applied biochemistry and pharmacology,"Practical laboratory classes teaching molecular pharmacology approaches employed in the development of therapeutic strategies are of great interest for students of courses in Biotechnology, Applied Biology, Pharmaceutic and Technology Chemistry, Translational Oncology. Unfortunately, in most cases the technology to be transferred to learning students is complex and requires multi-step approaches. In this respect, simple and straightforward experimental protocols might be of great interest. This study was aimed at presenting a laboratory exercise focusing (a) on a very challenging therapeutic strategy, i.e. microRNA therapeutics, and (b) on the employment of biomolecules of great interest in applied biology and pharmacology, i.e. peptide nucleic acids (PNAs). The aims of the practical laboratory were to determine: (a) the possible PNA-mediated arrest in RT-qPCR, to be eventually used to demonstrate PNA targeting of selected miRNAs; (b) the possible lack of activity on mutated PNA sequences; (c) the effects (if any) on the amplification of other unrelated miRNA sequences. The results which can be obtained support the following conclusions: PNA-mediated arrest in RT-qPCR can be analyzed in a easy way; mutated PNA sequences are completely inactive; the effects of the employed PNAs are specific and no inhibitory effect occurs on other unrelated miRNA sequences. This activity is simple (cell culture, RNA extraction, RT-qPCR are all well-established technologies), fast (starting from isolated and characterized RNA, few hours are just necessary), highly reproducible (therefore easily employed by even untrained students). On the other hand, these laboratory lessons require some facilities, the most critical being the availability of instruments for PCR. While this might be a problem in the case these instruments are not available, we would like to underline that determination of the presence or of a lack of amplified product can be also obtained using standard analytical approaches based on agarose gel electrophoresis.","['1 Department of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', '2 Department of Chemistry, Life Sciences and Environmental Sustainability, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.', '3 Interuniversity Consortium for Biotechnology (CIB), Trieste, Italy.']","Jessica Gasparello, Chiara Papi, Matteo Zurlo, Roberto Corradini, Roberto Gambari, Alessia Finotti, ",PloS one,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31509554

1248,An Observational Case Series of Spinal Cord Stimulation Waveforms Visualized on Intraoperative Neuromonitoring,"Introduction:
      
    

    
      Intraoperative neuromonitoring for spinal cord stimulation uses electromyography (EMG) responses to determine myotomal coverage as a marker for dermatomal coverage. These responses are utilized to determine the orientation of the electrode. Somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) collision testing can also be used in which sensory signals are decreased and/or eliminated when stimulation is activated. Methods:
      
    

    
      Fifteen patients were observed in the study. Each manufacturer had a minimum of three patients. Those included were Abbott BurstDR waveform, Boston Scientific burst stimulation, Medtronic high-dose stimulation, and Nevro high-frequency waveform. Efficacy of therapy was determined by a successful trial. Analysis performed during the permanent implant, included findings with traditional tonic stimulation, specific waveform and stimulation platforms, amplitude differences, and findings for both EMG responses and SSEP collision testing. Results:
      
    

    
      The Abbott BurstDR waveform produced the most findings. The amplitudes necessary to generate an observed EMG response were far lower than others, with a threshold of 10-20% of that seen in traditional tonic programming. The Medtronic high-dose programming and Nevro high-frequency waveform did not generate any observable EMG responses. Unique to Abbott BurstDR waveform was the onset of EMG activity in the distal muscle groups prior to proximal ones, as well as a hyperexcitability phenomenon acting as a primer generating signals at lower thresholds with more robust responses when returning to traditional tonic stimulation. EMG responses demonstrated propagation into one large EMG spike with BurstDR, while Boston Scientific burst stimulation had no propagation with separate spikes being consistent with traditional tonic stimulation. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      This observational series demonstrated distinct differences between the waveforms and stimulation alluding to different mechanisms of action. Nevro high-frequency and Abbott BurstDR waveforms appear to be most different in action from traditional tonic stimulation while Abbotts BurstDR appears to be the most energy efficient generating signals at the lowest thresholds with a propagating effect that leads to a hyperexcitable or primed stimulation state.","[""1 Director of Functional Neurosurgery, St. Luke's University Health Network, Bethlehem, PA, USA.""]","Steven M Falowski, ",Neuromodulation : journal of the International Neuromodulation Society,2019 Feb,EMG; Electromyogram; SCS; SSEPS; somatosensory evoked potentials; spinal cord stimulation; waveforms.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29707900

Preparation of novel materials with specific functions via chemical and biochemical routes or by methods based on electricity, magnetism, heat, and photoirradiation is the key to overcome the limitations of traditional analytical techniques and promote active research in the field of proteomics.

1252,From MEAs to MOAs: The Next Generation of Bioelectronic Interfaces for Neuronal Cultures,"Since their introduction in the early 1970s, microelectrode arrays (MEAs) have been dominating the electrophysiology market thanks to their reliability, extreme robustness, and usability. Over the past 40 years, silicon technology has also played a role in the advancement of the field, and CMOS-based in vitro and in vivo systems are now able to achieve unprecedented spatial resolutions, giving the possibility to unveil hidden behavior of cellular aggregates down to the subcellular level. However, both the MEAs and silicon-based electronic devices present unavoidable problems such as their expensiveness, the usual rigidity of the employed materials, and the need of an (usually bulky) external reference electrode. Possible interesting alternatives to these incredibly useful devices unexpectedly lie in the field of organic electronics, thanks to the fast-growing pace of improvement that this discipline has undergone in the last 10-15 years. In this chapter, a particular organic transistor called organic charge-modulated field-effect transistor (OCMFET) will be presented as a promising bio-electronic interface, and a complete description of its employment as a detector of cellular electrical activity and as an ultrasensitive pH sensor will be provided, together with the discussion about the possibility of using such a device as an innovative multisensing tool for both electrophysiology and (neuro)pharmacology.","['1 Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy. andrea.spanu@diee.unica.it.', '2 Center for Materials and Microsystems, FBK - ""Bruno Kessler"" Foundation, Trento, Italy. andrea.spanu@diee.unica.it.', '3 Department of Bioengineering, Robotics and System Engineering, University of Genoa, Genova, Italy.', '4 Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy.']","Andrea Spanu, Mariateresa Tedesco, Sergio Martinoia, Annalisa Bonfiglio, ",Advances in neurobiology,2019,Cell electrical activity monitoring; MEAs; OCMFETs; Pharmacology; pH sensing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31073935

If misregulated, they steer the progression of many inflammatory diseases. Much progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms underlying macrophage signaling, transcriptomics, and proteomics, under physiological and pathological conditions. Yet, the detailed mechanisms that tune circulating monocytes/macrophages and tissue-resident macrophage polarization, differentiation, specification, and their functional plasticity remain elusive. We review how physical factors affect macrophage phenotype and function, including how they hunt for particles and pathogens, as well as the implications for phagocytosis, autophagy, and polarization from proinflammatory to prohealing phenotype. We further discuss how this knowledge can be harnessed in regenerative medicine and for the design of new drugs and immune-modulatory drug delivery systems, biomaterials, and tissue scaffolds.","['1 Laboratory of Applied Mechanobiology, Institute of Translational Medicine, and Department of Health Sciences and Technology, ETH Zurich, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; email: viola.vogel@hest.ethz.ch.']","Nikhil Jain, Jens Moeller, Viola Vogel, ",Annual review of biomedical engineering,2019,immune cells; immunoengineering; macrophage mechanics; mechanotranscriptomics; mechanotransduction; resident macrophages.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31167103
1254,Electrophysiological Source Imaging: A Noninvasive Window to Brain Dynamics,Brain activity and connectivity are distributed in the three-dimensional space and evolve in time. It is important to image brain dynamics with high spatial and temporal resolution. Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are noninvasive measurements associated with complex neural activations and interactions that encode brain functions. Electrophysiological source imaging estimates the underlying brain electrical sources from EEG and MEG measurements. It offers increasingly improved spatial resolution and intrinsically high temporal resolution for imaging large-scale brain activity and connectivity on a wide range of timescales. Integration of electrophysiological source imaging and functional magnetic resonance imaging could further enhance spatiotemporal resolution and specificity to an extent that is not attainable with either technique alone.

1255,Interaction of Cu+2 with α-Crystallin: A Biophysical and Mass Spectrometric Study,"Background:
      
    

    
      αA- and αB- crystallin are members of small heat shock protein family with chaperone property. Their interactions with Cu2+ ions are reported in neurodegenerative diseases. We have been studying the effect of small ionic molecules on the stability of α-crystallin. Cu2+ is co-ordinated with αB-crystallin involving three histidine residues and one aspartic acid residue as potential binding sites. However, copper binding sites for the oligomeric native protein αA-crystallin protein is not known. Objective:
      
    

    
      The objective of this study was to study oligomerization and stability of αA- and αBcrystallin in presence and absence of Cu2+ ions and to find binding sites of Cu2+ on αA-crystallin. Methods:
      
    

    
      The recombinant Human αA- and αB-crystallin proteins were purified after overexpression from the E. coli BL21DE3 cell lysate by a combination of ion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography. Mass analysis of αA- and αB-crystallin in absence and presence of Cu2+ were carried out by MALDI TOF MS. Stability of αA-crystallin in presence and absence of Cu2+ was determined by equilibrium urea denaturation experiments. The equilibrium urea unfolding profiles of the αA-crystallin in absence and presence of different Cu2+ concentrations were fitted according to the three state model of protein unfolding. Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) measurements were carried out to detect the oligomeric size of αA-crystallin in presence and absence of Cu2+ during urea unfolding. Histidine residues were modified by DEPC (Diethyl pyro carbonate). Chemically modified and unmodified αA-crystallin was digested by trypsin prior to MALDI MS analysis. Cu2+ pre-incubation was done before the chemical modification. Results:
      
    

    
      Mass spectrometric detection of intact protein allows direct measurement of Cu2+ ions bound to the protein. Thus the average numbers of Cu2+ bound to αA- and αB-crystallin were 4.2 and 3.6 respectively per subunit. It is seen that in presence of Cu2+ ions the free energy (ΔG) of unfolding of αA-crystallin almost doubled. The size analysis by dynamic light scattering data clearly indicated that in presence of Cu2+ ions the oligomeric size remain unchanged with increasing urea solutions. Mass spectrometric detection with chemical modification of histidine residues of αA-crystallin in presence and absence of Cu2+ indicated that amino acid residues H107, H100, H115 of αA-crystallin are involved in Cu2+ binding. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Our results indicated that Cu2+ helped in increasing stability of αA-crystallin and three histidine residues H100, H107 and H115 of αA-crystallin are Cu2+ binding residues.","['1 Department of Biotechnology, Techno India University West Bengal, EM-4 Sector V, Salt Lake, Kolkata-700091, India.', '2 Protein Chemistry Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, Bose Institute, 93/1 A.P.C.

      Exposure to unpredictable trips and slips can improve balance recovery responses but it was not known if older adults can tolerate such high intensity training. The study aim was to determine if reactive balance in both young and older adults could be trained in a single day through exposure to slip and trip hazards hidden in unpredictable walkway locations. Methods:
      
    

    
      Ten young (20-40 yr) and ten older adults (65 + yr) completed 32 trials on a 10-meter trip and slip walkway; 14 slip trials, 14 trip trials and 4 no-perturbation trials presented in a pseudo-random order. Participant usual gait speed was regulated using a metronome and stepping tiles at fixed distances. Gait kinematics (Vicon motion capture), falls (> 30% body weight into the harness), anxiety and confidence to avoid falling were assessed. Findings:
      
    

    
      Margin of stability for balance recovery after slips substantially improved at training completion for older adults (effect size = 1.13, P = 0.019). Falls from slips also decreased: 44.4% to 0% in the young adults; and 28.6% to 14.3% in the older adults. Although confidence to avoid falling did not change, anxiety increased during training with one young and three older participants withdrawing during training. Interpretations:
      
    

    
      The findings indicate exposure to unpredictable perturbations improves reactive balance in young and older adults. However, improvements of balance recovery from trips were not significant. Elevated anxiety levels and a high dropout rate suggest the need for more individualised training over multiple days.","['1 Falls, Balance and Injury Research Centre, Neuroscience Research Australia, Sydney, NSW, Australia; University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia; The Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, Tokyo, Japan.

1258,PEG-Anthracene Hydrogels as an On-Demand Stiffening Matrix To Study Mechanobiology,"There is a growing interest in materials that can dynamically change their properties in the presence of cells to study mechanobiology. Herein, we exploit the 365 nm light mediated [4+4] photodimerization of anthracene groups to develop cytocompatible PEG-based hydrogels with tailorable initial moduli that can be further stiffened. A hydrogel formulation that can stiffen from 10 to 50 kPa, corresponding to the stiffness of a healthy and fibrotic heart, respectively, was prepared. This system was used to monitor the stiffness-dependent localization of NFAT, a downstream target of intracellular calcium signaling using a reporter in live cardiac fibroblasts (CFbs). NFAT translocates to the nucleus of CFbs on stiffening hydrogels within 6 h, whereas it remains cytoplasmic when the CFbs are cultured on either 10 or 50 kPa static hydrogels. This finding demonstrates how dynamic changes in the mechanical properties of a material can reveal the kinetics of mechanoresponsive cell signaling pathways that may otherwise be missed in cells cultured on static substrates.","['1 Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, University of Colorado, Boulder, Boulder, CO, 80309, USA.', '2 The BioFrontiers Institute, University of Colorado, Boulder, Boulder, CO, 80309, USA.', '3 Department of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology, University of Colorado, Boulder, Boulder, CO, 80309, USA.']","Kemal Arda Günay, Tova L Ceccato, Jason S Silver, Kendra L Bannister, Olivia J Bednarski, Leslie A Leinwand, Kristi S Anseth, ",Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2019,hydrogels; matrix mechanics; mechanobiology; photochemistry; signal transduction.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31119851

Our findings showed that in contrast to predominantly transient depolarization observed in A1 of anesthetized animals, both transient and sustained depolarization (during or beyond the stimulus period) were observed. Comparing with spiking responses, subthreshold responses were often longer lasting in duration and more broadly tuned in frequency, and showed narrower intensity tuning in non-monotonic neurons and lower response threshold in monotonic neurons. These observations demonstrated the enhancement of stimulus selectivity from subthreshold to spiking responses in individual A1 neurons. Furthermore, A1 neurons classified as regular- or fast-spiking subpopulation based on their spike shapes exhibited distinct response properties in frequency and intensity domains. These findings provide valuable insights into cortical integration and transformation of auditory information at the cellular level in auditory cortex of awake non-human primates.","['1 Laboratory of Auditory Neurophysiology, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', ""2 Interdisciplinary Institute of Neuroscience and Technology, Qiushi Academy for Advanced Studies, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China.""]","Lixia Gao, Xiaoqin Wang, ","Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)",2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29377991

      The purpose of this study was to test the effects of navigated repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, delivered in different modes, on motor impairments and functional limitations after stroke. Methods:
      
    

    
      The study sample included 42 patients (58.5 ± 10.7 years; 26 males) who experienced a single unilateral stroke (1-12 months previously) in the area of the middle cerebral artery. Patients completed a course of conventional rehabilitation, together with 10 sessions of navigated repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation or sham stimulation. Stimulation was scheduled five times a week over two consecutive weeks in an inpatient clinical setting. Patients were randomly assigned to one of four groups and received sham stimulation (n = 10), low-frequency (1-Hz) stimulation of the nonaffected hemisphere (n = 11), high-frequency (10-Hz) stimulation of the affected hemisphere (n = 13), or sequential combination of low- and high-frequency stimulations (n = 8). Participants were evaluated before and after stimulation with clinical tests, including the arm and hand section of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment Scale, modified Ashworth Scale of Muscle Spasticity, and Barthel Index of Activities of Daily Living. Results:
      
    

    
      Participants in the three groups receiving navigated repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation showed improvements in arm and hand functions on the Fugl-Meyer Stroke Assessment Scale. Ashworth Scale of Muscle Spasticity and Barthel Index scores were significantly reduced in groups receiving low- or high-frequency stimulation alone. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Including navigated repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in a conventional rehabilitation program positively influenced motor and functional recovery in study participants, demonstrating the clinical potential of the method.

Neutron reflectometry experiments showed how the transverse structure and mechanical properties of the bilayer were modified, upon insertion of the proteins in single model-membranes, either supported on solid substrate or floating. Parallel electrophysiology experiments were performed on the same channels reconstituted in free-standing planar lipid bilayers, of both typical composition and matched to the neutron reflectometry experiment, assessing their electrical features. Functional and structural results converge in detecting that the proteins, conical in shape, insert with a directionality, cytosolic side first. Our work addresses the powerful combination of the two experimental approaches. We show here that membrane structure spectroscopy and ion channel electrophysiology can become synergistic tools in the analysis of structural-functional properties of biomimetic complex environment.","['1 Dept. of Medical Biotechnologies and Translational Medicine, University of Milan, Italy.', '2 Institut Laue-Langevin, 71 avenue des Martyrs, BP 156, 38000 Grenoble Cedex, France.', '3 Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin für Materialien und Energie, Institute for Soft Matter and Functional Materials, Hahn-Meitner-Platz 1, 14109 Berlin, Germany.', '4 Dept. of Biosciences, University of Milan and Institute of Biophysics, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, CNR, Milano, Italy.', '5 Dept.

1266,Applications of Spatio-temporal Mapping and Particle Analysis Techniques to Quantify Intracellular Ca2+ Signaling In Situ,"Ca2+ imaging of isolated cells or specific types of cells within intact tissues often reveals complex patterns of Ca2+ signaling. This activity requires careful and in-depth analyses and quantification to capture as much information about the underlying events as possible. Spatial, temporal and intensity parameters intrinsic to Ca2+ signals such as frequency, duration, propagation, velocity and amplitude may provide some biological information required for intracellular signalling. High-resolution Ca2+ imaging typically results in the acquisition of large data files that are time consuming to process in terms of translating the imaging information into quantifiable data, and this process can be susceptible to human error and bias. Analysis of Ca2+ signals from cells in situ typically relies on simple intensity measurements from arbitrarily selected regions of interest (ROI) within a field of view (FOV). This approach ignores much of the important signaling information contained in the FOV. Thus, in order to maximize recovery of information from such high-resolution recordings obtained with Ca2+dyes or optogenetic Ca2+ imaging, appropriate spatial and temporal analysis of the Ca2+ signals is required. The protocols outlined in this paper will describe how a high volume of data can be obtained from Ca2+ imaging recordings to facilitate more complete analysis and quantification of Ca2+ signals recorded from cells using a combination of spatiotemporal map (STM)-based analysis and particle-based analysis. The protocols also describe how different patterns of Ca2+ signaling observed in different cell populations in situ can be analyzed appropriately. For illustration, the method will examine Ca2+ signaling in a specialized population of cells in the small intestine, interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), using GECIs.","['1 Department of Physiology and Cell Biology, University of Nevada Reno School of Medicine; bdrumm@med.unr.edu.', '2 Department of Pharmacology, The Robert Larner, M.D. College of Medicine, University of Vermont.', '3 Department of Physiology and Cell Biology, University of Nevada Reno School of Medicine.']","Bernard T Drumm, Grant W Hennig, Salah A Baker, Kenton M Sanders, ",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30663707

The approach identified a network of known and novel interactions and binding sites in Escherichia coli, and we demonstrated the functional relevance of a number of newly identified interactions. Our data enabled identification of new enzyme-substrate relationships and cases of metabolite-induced remodeling of protein complexes. Our metabolite-protein interactome consists of 1,678 interactions and 7,345 putative binding sites.

1270,Variability in pulmonary vein electrophysiology and fibrosis determines arrhythmia susceptibility and dynamics,"Success rates for catheter ablation of persistent atrial fibrillation patients are currently low; however, there is a subset of patients for whom electrical isolation of the pulmonary veins alone is a successful treatment strategy. It is difficult to identify these patients because there are a multitude of factors affecting arrhythmia susceptibility and maintenance, and the individual contributions of these factors are difficult to determine clinically. We hypothesised that the combination of pulmonary vein (PV) electrophysiology and atrial body fibrosis determine driver location and effectiveness of pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). We used bilayer biatrial computer models based on patient geometries to investigate the effects of PV properties and atrial fibrosis on arrhythmia inducibility, maintenance mechanisms, and the outcome of PVI. Short PV action potential duration (APD) increased arrhythmia susceptibility, while longer PV APD was found to be protective. Arrhythmia inducibility increased with slower conduction velocity (CV) at the LA/PV junction, but not for cases with homogeneous CV changes or slower CV at the distal PV. Phase singularity (PS) density in the PV region for cases with PV fibrosis was increased. Arrhythmia dynamics depend on both PV properties and fibrosis distribution, varying from meandering rotors to PV reentry (in cases with baseline or long APD), to stable rotors at regions of high fibrosis density. Measurement of fibrosis and PV properties may indicate patient specific susceptibility to AF initiation and maintenance. PV PS density before PVI was higher for cases in which AF terminated or converted to a macroreentry; thus, high PV PS density may indicate likelihood of PVI success.","['1 IHU Liryc, Electrophysiology and Heart Modeling Institute, foundation Bordeaux Université, F-33600 Pessac- Bordeaux, France.', ""2 Division of Imaging Sciences and Biomedical Engineering, King's College London, London, United Kingdom."", '3 Univ.

It begins with contextualizing genetic edition within the specific nature of modern technology. Afterwards it presents the contrast between natural beings and artifacts that sheds light for answering the question about the real possibility of replacing natural beings, as they are, with technologically projected living beings. In the third place, after acknowledging the scarce attention given by contemporary theology to technology, it shows the convergence of the Christian concept of creation with the respect for balance in nature, as most part of the contemporaty ecological sensibility upholds. Building on this common ground it shows that the Christian attitude towards technology is not technofobical but the integration of technology -a central element of contemporary culture- with nature, accepting the limitation of any natural being including mankind. In this way, vulnerability, as a visible consequence of this finitude, is the very attribute of human beings that makes ourselves equal and requieres recongnition of our common dignity, way over the idea of acquiring an ideal perfection through technology, even if it was accesible to all.","['1 Facultad de Teología, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile.

While combining multisite parallel recordings with structural circuits' reconstruction in vivo is still very challenging, the reductionist in vitro approach based on neuronal cultures offers lower technical difficulties and is much more stable under control conditions. In this chapter, we present different approaches to infer the connectivity of cultured neuronal networks using multielectrode array or calcium imaging recordings.

Despite numerous surface-sensitive techniques having been applied to their study, the comprehensive optical characterization of SLBs using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) has not been conducted. In this study, Fresnel multilayer analysis is utilized to effectively calculate layer parameters (thickness and refractive indices) with the aid of dual-wavelength and dispersion coefficient analysis, in which the linear change in the refractive index as a function of wavelength is assumed. Using complementary information from impedance-based quartz crystal microbalance experiments, biophysical properties, for example, area-per-lipid-molecule and the quantity of lipid-associated water molecules, are calculated for different lipid types and mixtures, one of which is representative of a raft-forming lipid mixture. It is proposed that the hydration layer beneath the bilayer is, in fact, an integral part of the measured optical signal. Also, the traditional Jung model analysis and the ratio of SPR responses are investigated in terms of assessing the structure of the lipid layer that is formed.","['1 Drug Research Program, Division of Pharmaceutical Biosciences, Faculty of Pharmacy , University of Helsinki , 00014 Helsinki , Finland.', '2 Department of Cytobiochemistry, Faculty of Biotechnology , University of Wrocław , 50-383 Wrocław , Poland.']","Petteri Parkkila, Mohamed Elderdfi, Alex Bunker, Tapani Viitala, ",Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29894192

1279,Biophysical attributes that affect CaMKII activation deduced with a novel spatial stochastic simulation approach,"Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) holoenzymes play a critical role in decoding Ca2+ signals in neurons. Understanding how this occurs has been the focus of numerous studies including many that use models. However, CaMKII is notoriously difficult to simulate in detail because of its multi-subunit nature, which causes a combinatorial explosion in the number of species that must be modeled. To study the Ca2+-calmodulin-CaMKII reaction network with detailed kinetics while including the effect of diffusion, we have customized an existing stochastic particle-based simulator, Smoldyn, to manage the problem of combinatorial explosion. With this new method, spatial and temporal aspects of the signaling network can be studied without compromising biochemical details. We used this new method to examine how calmodulin molecules, both partially loaded and fully loaded with Ca2+, choose pathways to interact with and activate CaMKII under various Ca2+ input conditions. We found that the dependence of CaMKII phosphorylation on Ca2+ signal frequency is intrinsic to the network kinetics and the activation pattern can be modulated by the relative amount of Ca2+ to calmodulin and by the rate of Ca2+ diffusion. Depending on whether Ca2+ influx is saturating or not, calmodulin molecules could choose different routes within the network to activate CaMKII subunits, resulting in different frequency dependence patterns. In addition, the size of the holoenzyme produces a subtle effect on CaMKII activation. The more extended the subunits are organized, the easier for calmodulin molecules to access and activate the subunits. The findings suggest that particular intracellular environmental factors such as crowding and calmodulin availability can play an important role in decoding Ca2+ signals and can give rise to distinct CaMKII activation patterns in dendritic spines, Ca2+ channel nanodomains and cytoplasm.","['1 Department of Biological Sciences, Neuroscience Program, Ohio University, Athens, Ohio, United States of America.']","Ximing Li, William R Holmes, ",PLoS computational biology,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29401454

1282,Modular microfluidics enables kinetic insight from time-resolved cryo-EM,"Mechanistic understanding of biochemical reactions requires structural and kinetic characterization of the underlying chemical processes. However, no single experimental technique can provide this information in a broadly applicable manner and thus structural studies of static macromolecules are often complemented by biophysical analysis. Moreover, the common strategy of utilizing mutants or crosslinking probes to stabilize intermediates is prone to trapping off-pathway artefacts and precludes determining the order of molecular events. Here we report a time-resolved sample preparation method for cryo-electron microscopy (trEM) using a modular microfluidic device, featuring a 3D-mixing unit and variable delay lines that enables automated, fast, and blot-free sample vitrification.

1283,Theoretical and numerical studies on a five-ray flexible pectoral fin during labriform swimming,"Natural fish have evolved with an excellent swimming performance after millions of years. Based on the flexible features of the pectoral fin, this paper focuses on the kinematics and hydrodynamics of the fin when fish are swimming stably in still water in labriform mode. The locomotion mechanism based on the morphology of the pectoral fin is applied to establish a kinematic model composed of five rays and membranes, which is adopted to control the pectoral fin to reach deformation in approximately the same way as the labriform mode. A semi-empirical theoretical model based on the kinematics is proposed to calculate the hydrodynamic force. In order to study the flow field, the numerical simulation of fluid-structure interaction is carried out and the results are validated by the present semi-empirical model, which also verifies the feasibility of the semi-empirical theoretical model for describing the dynamics of the pectoral fin under a complex water environment. In addition, the relationship between propulsion performance and locomotion parameters (e.g. frequency of motion, amplitude of flapping and rowing angle, and phase lag between flapping and rowing) of the multi-degree of freedom flexible pectoral fin is also revealed. It is found that the frequency and amplitude of the flapping angle have a significant influence on the hydrodynamic thrust, while the rowing angle and phase lag have little effect. The established models and the results provide effective tools and significant reference for the design of bionic pectoral fins.","[""1 State Key Laboratory of Advanced Design and Manufacturing for Vehicle Body, College of Mechanical and Vehicle Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha 410082, People's Republic of China.

1284,A Molecular Biophysical Approach to Diclofenac Topical Gastrointestinal Damage,"Diclofenac (DCF), the most widely consumed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) worldwide, is associated with adverse typical effects, including gastrointestinal (GI) complications. The present study aims to better understand the topical toxicity induced by DCF using membrane models that mimic the physiological, biophysical, and chemical environments of GI mucosa segments. For this purpose, phospholipidic model systems that mimic the GI protective lining and lipid models of the inner mitochondrial membrane were used together with a wide set of techniques: derivative spectrophotometry to evaluate drug distribution at the membrane; steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence to predict drug location at the membrane; fluorescence anisotropy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and calcein leakage studies to evaluate the drug-induced disturbance on membrane microviscosity and permeability; and small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering studies (SAXS and WAXS, respectively), to evaluate the effects of DCF at the membrane structure. Results demonstrated that DCF interacts chemically with the phospholipids of the GI protective barrier in a pH-dependent manner and confirmed the DCF location at the lipid headgroup region, as well as DCF's higher distribution at mitochondrial membrane contact points where the impairment of biophysical properties is consistent with the uncoupling effects reported for this drug.","['1 CF-UM-UP, Centro de Física das Universidades do Minho e Porto, Departamento de Física da Universidade do Minho, Campus de Gualtar, 4710-057 Braga, Portugal. eduardabfer@gmail.com.', '2 CF-UM-UP, Centro de Física das Universidades do Minho e Porto, Departamento de Física da Universidade do Minho, Campus de Gualtar, 4710-057 Braga, Portugal. telmabsoares@gmail.com.', '3 CF-UM-UP, Centro de Física das Universidades do Minho e Porto, Departamento de Física da Universidade do Minho, Campus de Gualtar, 4710-057 Braga, Portugal. goncalves.hmc@fisica.uminho.pt.', '4 Sincrotrone Trieste, SS 14 km 163.5, 34012 Basovizza, Italy. sigrid.bernstorff@elettra.eu.', '5 CF-UM-UP, Centro de Física das Universidades do Minho e Porto, Departamento de Física da Universidade do Minho, Campus de Gualtar, 4710-057 Braga, Portugal. beta@fisica.uminho.pt.', '6 FP-ENAS/CEBIMED-Fernando Pessoa Energy, Environment and Health Research Unit/Biomedical Research Centre, Faculty of Health Sciences, Fernando Pessoa University, 4249-004 Porto, Portugal. cmlopes@ufp.edu.pt.', '7 CF-UM-UP, Centro de Física das Universidades do Minho e Porto, Departamento de Física da Universidade do Minho, Campus de Gualtar, 4710-057 Braga, Portugal. mlucio@fisica.uminho.pt.']","Eduarda Fernandes, Telma B Soares, Hugo Gonçalves, Sigrid Bernstorff, Maria Elisabete C D Real Oliveira, Carla M Lopes, Marlene Lúcio, ",International journal of molecular sciences,2018,DLS; DSC; NSAIDs; SAXS; WAXS; derivative spectrophotometry; diclofenac; gastrointestinal topical toxicity; steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence; steady-state anisotropy.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30384433

Pure grid cells generate grid codes that have been assumed to be independent of head direction, whereas conjunctive cells generate grid representations that are tuned to a single head direction. Here, we demonstrate that pure grid cells also encode head direction, but through distinct mechanisms. We show that individual firing fields of pure grid cells are tuned to multiple head directions, with the preferred sets of directions differing between fields. This local directional modulation is not predicted by previous continuous attractor or oscillatory interference models of grid firing but is accounted for by models in which pure grid cells integrate inputs from co-aligned conjunctive cells with firing rates that differ between their fields. We suggest that local directional signals from grid cells may contribute to downstream computations by decorrelating different points of view from the same location.","['1 Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, EH8 9XD, UK.', '2 School of Mathematics, Maxwell Institute and Centre for Statistics, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, EH9 3FD, UK.', '3 The Alan Turing Institute, 96 Euston Road, London, NW1 2DB, UK.', '4 Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, EH8 9XD, UK. mattnolan@ed.ac.uk.', '5 Simons Initiative for the Developing Brain, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, EH8 9XD, UK. mattnolan@ed.ac.uk.']","Klara Gerlei, Jessica Passlack, Ian Hawes, Brianna Vandrey, Holly Stevens, Ioannis Papastathopoulos, Matthew F Nolan, ",Nature communications,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32839445

1289,Thanatobiochemistry: its contribution to the diagnosis of hypothermia fatalities,"Hypothermia is a potentially lethal pathology whose in vivo diagnosis is relatively easy, based on the observation of a body temperature below 35̊C. However, its post mortem diagnosis is much more complex because of a thermal decrease occurring systematically after the death, which renders most often uninterpretable the body temperature as a diagnostic argument for hypothermia. Moreover, none of the macroscopic or microscopic autopsy elements described as suspicious of hypothermia are pathognomonic of a hypothermic death. Currently, this diagnosis arises in the light of an association of concordant arguments including these autopsic and histological elements but also some biomarkers. The aim of this article is to illustrate by a practical case the diagnostic complexity of a death by hypothermia through the evocative elements currently described, by emphasizing the reflection on some biomarkers confirmed or under study.","[""1 Département de biochimie et génétique, Centre hospitalier universitaire d'Angers, Angers, France, Service de médecine légale et pénitentiaire, Centre hospitalier universitaire d'Angers, Angers, France."", ""2 GEROM-LHEA, IRIS-IBS Institut de biologie en santé, Centre hospitalier universitaire d'Angers, Angers, France."", '3 Laboratoire de biochimie et biologie moléculaire, Centre hospitalier régional universitaire de Tours, Hôpital Trousseau, Chambray-lès-Tours, France.', ""4 Laboratoire de toxicologie, Centre hospitalier universitaire d'Angers, Angers, France."", ""5 Service de médecine légale et pénitentiaire, Centre hospitalier universitaire d'Angers, Angers, France."", ""6 Département de biochimie et génétique, Centre hospitalier universitaire d'Angers, Angers, France."", '7 Service de médecine légale, Centre hospitalier régional universitaire de Tours, Hôpital Trousseau, Chambray-lès-Tours, France.']","Guillaume Rousseau, Clotilde Rougé-Maillart, Hugo Alarcan, Guillaume Drevin, Alexia Gaconnet, Pascal Reynier, Pauline Saint-Martin, Camille Rérolle, ",Annales de biologie clinique,2019,forensic sciences; hypothermia; post mortem; thanatobiochemistry.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31649011

1292,Mass Spectrometry Approaches to Glycomic and Glycoproteomic Analyses,"Glycomic and glycoproteomic analyses involve the characterization of oligosaccharides (glycans) conjugated to proteins. Glycans are produced through a complicated nontemplate driven process involving the competition of enzymes that extend the nascent chain. The large diversity of structures, the variations in polarity of the individual saccharide residues, and the poor ionization efficiencies of glycans all conspire to make the analysis arguably much more difficult than any other biopolymer. Furthermore, the large number of glycoforms associated with a specific protein site makes it more difficult to characterize than any post-translational modification. Nonetheless, there have been significant progress, and advanced separation and mass spectrometry methods have been at its center and the main reason for the progress. While glycomic and glycoproteomic analyses are still typically available only through highly specialized laboratories, new software and workflow is making it more accessible. This review focuses on the role of mass spectrometry and separation methods in advancing glycomic and glycoproteomic analyses. It describes the current state of the field and progress toward making it more available to the larger scientific community.","['1 Department of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine , Leiden University Medical Center , 2333 ZA Leiden , The Netherlands.', '2 Department of Chemistry , University of California, Davis , One Shields Avenue , Davis , California 95616 , United States.', '3 Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine , University of California, Davis , Davis , California 95616 , United States.', '4 Foods for Health Institute , University of California, Davis , Davis , California 95616 , United States.']","L Renee Ruhaak, Gege Xu, Qiongyu Li, Elisha Goonatilleke, Carlito B Lebrilla, ",Chemical reviews,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29553244

      To analyze the plasma lipid spectrum between healthy control and patients with pancreatic cancer and to select differentially expressed tumor markers for early diagnosis. Methods:
      
    

    
      In total, 20 patents were divided into case group and healthy control group according to surgical pathology. Of almost 1206 plasma lipid molecules harvested from 20 patients were measured by HILIC using the normal phase LC/MS. Heat map presented the relative levels of metabolites and lipids in the healthy control group and patients with pancreatic cancer. The PCA model was constructed to find out the difference in lipid metabolites. The principal components were drawn in a score plot and any clustering tendency could be observed. PLS-DA were performed to distinguish the healthy control group and pancreatic cancer according to the identified lipid profiling datasets. The volcano plot was used to visualize all variables with VIP>1 and presented the important variables with P<0.01 and |FC|>2. Results:
      
    

    
      The upregulated lipid metabolites in patients with pancreatic cancer contained 9 lipids; however, the downregulated lipid metabolites contained 79 lipids. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      There were lipid metabolomic differences in patients with pancreatic cancer, which could serve as potential tumor markers for pancreatic cancer.","[""1 Master, Department of General Surgery, Shanghai Fourth People's Hospital Affiliated to Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.

The high reproductive capability of this species is initiated by the ingestion of a large amount of blood ingested by the engorged female tick. The degree of ovarian development is proportional to the number of eggs laid. Studying the regulatory mechanism of tick ovary development is relevant for the development of novel tick control methods. In this study, we used quantitative proteomics to study the dynamic changes in protein expression and protein phosphorylation during ovarian development of engorged female H. longicornis ticks. Synergistic action of many proteins (n = 3031) is required to achieve ovarian development and oocyte formation rapidly. Through bioinformatics analysis, changes in protein expressions and phosphorylation modifications in regulating the ovarian development of female ticks are described. Many proteins play an essential role during ovarian development. Also, protein phosphorylation appeared an important reproductive strategy to enable ticks to efficiently convert large amounts of blood in the ovaries into egg-producing components and ultimately produce many eggs.","['1 Hebei Key Laboratory of Animal Physiology, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Life Sciences, Hebei Normal University, Shijiazhuang, 050024, China.', '2 Instrumental Analysis Center, Hebei Normal University, Shijiazhuang, 050024, China.', '3 Hebei Key Laboratory of Animal Physiology, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Life Sciences, Hebei Normal University, Shijiazhuang, 050024, China. liujingze@hebtu.edu.cn.', '4 , Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China. liujingze@hebtu.edu.cn.', '5 Hebei Key Laboratory of Animal Physiology, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Life Sciences, Hebei Normal University, Shijiazhuang, 050024, China. whui1981@163.com.', '6 , Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China. whui1981@163.com.']","Minjing Wang, Yuhong Hu, Mengxue Li, Qianqian Xu, Xiaoli Zhang, Xiaoshuang Wang, Xiaomin Xue, Qi Xiao, Jingze Liu, Hui Wang, ",Experimental & applied acarology,2020 Feb,DIA; Haemaphysalis longicornis; Ovary; Phosphorylation; Proteomics.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31919614
1297,Prediabetes Induced by Fructose-Enriched Diet Influences Cardiac Lipidome and Proteome and Leads to Deterioration of Cardiac Function prior to the Development of Excessive Oxidative Stress and Cell Damage,"Prediabetes is a condition affecting more than 35% of the population. In some forms, excessive carbohydrate intake (primarily refined sugar) plays a prominent role. Prediabetes is a symptomless, mostly unrecognized disease which increases cardiovascular risk. In our work, we examined the effect of a fructose-enriched diet on cardiac function and lipidome as well as proteome of cardiac muscle. Male Wistar rats were divided into two groups. The control group received a normal diet while the fructose-fed group received 60% fructose-supplemented chow for 24 weeks. Fasting blood glucose measurement and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) showed slightly but significantly elevated values due to fructose feeding indicating development of a prediabetic condition. Both echocardiography and isolated working heart perfusion performed at the end of the feeding protocol demonstrated diastolic cardiac dysfunction in the fructose-fed group. Mass spectrometry-based, high-performance lipidomic and proteomic analyses were executed from cardiac tissue. The lipidomic analysis revealed complex rearrangement of the whole lipidome with special emphasis on defects in cardiolipin remodeling. The proteomic analysis showed significant changes in 75 cardiac proteins due to fructose feeding including mitochondria-, apoptosis-, and oxidative stress-related proteins. Nevertheless, just very weak or no signs of apoptosis induction and oxidative stress were detected in the hearts of fructose-fed rats. Our results suggest that fructose feeding induces marked alterations in the cardiac lipidome, especially in cardiolipin remodeling, which leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired cardiac function. However, at the same time, several adaptive responses are induced at the proteome level in order to maintain a homeostatic balance. These findings demonstrate that even very early stages of prediabetes can impair cardiac function and can result in significant changes in the lipidome and proteome of the heart prior to the development of excessive oxidative stress and cell damage.","['1 Metabolic Diseases and Cell Signaling Group, Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Szeged, Szeged H-6720, Hungary.', '2 Interdisciplinary Centre of Excellence, University of Szeged, Szeged H-6720, Hungary.', '3 Institute of Biochemistry, Biological Research Center of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Szeged H-6726, Hungary.', '4 Institute of Medical Chemistry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Szeged, Szeged H-6720, Hungary.', '5 Department of Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Szeged, Szeged H-6720, Hungary.']","Gergő Szűcs, Andrea Sója, Mária Péter, Márta Sárközy, Bella Bruszel, Andrea Siska, Imre Földesi, Zoltán Szabó, Tamás Janáky, László Vígh, Gábor Balogh, Tamás Csont, ",Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31885782
1298,Unified cochlear model for low- and high-frequency mammalian hearing,"The spatial variations of the intricate cytoarchitecture, fluid scalae, and mechano-electric transduction in the mammalian cochlea have long been postulated to provide the organ with the ability to perform a real-time, time-frequency processing of sound. However, the precise manner by which this tripartite coupling enables the exquisite cochlear filtering has yet to be articulated in a base-to-apex mathematical model. Moreover, while sound-evoked tuning curves derived from mechanical gains are excellent surrogates for auditory nerve fiber thresholds at the base of the cochlea, this correlation fails at the apex. The key factors influencing the divergence of both mechanical and neural tuning at the apex, as well as the spatial variation of mechanical tuning, are incompletely understood. We develop a model that shows that the mechanical effects arising from the combination of the taper of the cochlear scalae and the spatial variation of the cytoarchitecture of the cochlea provide robust mechanisms that modulate the outer hair cell-mediated active response and provide the basis for the transition of the mechanical gain spectra along the cochlear spiral. Further, the model predicts that the neural tuning at the base is primarily governed by the mechanical filtering of the cochlear partition. At the apex, microscale fluid dynamics and nanoscale channel dynamics must also be invoked to describe the threshold neural tuning for low frequencies. Overall, the model delineates a physiological basis for the difference between basal and apical gain seen in experiments and provides a coherent description of high- and low-frequency cochlear tuning.","['1 Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.', '2 Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109; grosh@umich.edu.', '3 Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.']","Aritra Sasmal, Karl Grosh, ",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019,biophysics; cochlear mechanics; emergent system response; finite-element method; low-frequency hearing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31221750

1300,Split-BioID - Proteomic Analysis of Context-specific Protein Complexes in Their Native Cellular Environment,"To complement existing affinity purification (AP) approaches for the identification of protein-protein interactions (PPI), enzymes have been introduced that allow the proximity-dependent labeling of proteins in living cells. One such enzyme, BirA* (used in the BioID approach), mediates the biotinylation of proteins within a range of approximately 10 nm. Hence, when fused to a protein of interest and expressed in cells, it allows the labeling of proximal proteins in their native environment. As opposed to AP that relies on the purification of assembled protein complexes, BioID detects proteins that have been marked within cells no matter whether they are still interacting with the protein of interest when they are isolated. Since it biotinylates proximal proteins, one can moreover capitalize on the exceptional affinity of streptavidin for biotin to very efficiently isolate them. While BioID performs better than AP for identifying transient or weak interactions, both AP- and BioID-mass spectrometry approaches provide an overview of all possible interactions a given protein may have. However, they do not provide information on the context of each identified PPI. Indeed, most proteins are typically part of several complexes, corresponding to distinct maturation steps or different functional units. To address this common limitation of both methods, we have engineered a protein-fragments complementation assay based on the BirA* enzyme. In this assay, two inactive fragments of BirA* can reassemble into an active enzyme when brought in close proximity by two interacting proteins to which they are fused. The resulting split-BioID assay thus allows the labeling of proteins that assemble around a pair of interacting proteins. Provided these two only interact in a given context, split-BioID then allows the analysis of specific context-dependent functional units in their native cellular environment. Here, we provide a step-by-step protocol to test and apply split-BioID to a pair of interacting proteins.","['1 Cluster of excellence CellNetworks, Heidelberg University; Heidelberg University Biochemistry Center (BZH).', '2 Cluster of excellence CellNetworks, Heidelberg University; Heidelberg University Biochemistry Center (BZH); julien.bethune@bzh.uni-heidelberg.de.']","Isabel M Schopp, Julien Béthune, ",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29733317
1301,Biophysical Analysis of the Protein-Small Molecule Interactions to Develop Small Molecule Drug Discovery,"In small molecule drug discovery, researchers must find specific binders that interact with a target protein and inhibit its function in connection with human diseases. It is of critical importance to know the binding mode of compounds interacting with a target protein to assure hit validation and optimization. Biophysical analysis is a powerful quantitative approach to evaluate the binding modes of such candidates. Since the level of sensitivity of biophysical analysis is suitable to quantitatively detect the binding of fragment compounds, and because of the remarkable success of compound libraries of small molecules, the development and adaptation of biophysical analysis for these applications is in great demand. Herein, we describe the technical developments of biophysical methods, especially thermodynamic and kinetic analysis, for the purpose of screenings which employ small molecules. In addition, we discuss the interaction mechanisms of small molecules to find hit compounds based on these biophysical analyses.","['1 School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo.', '2 The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo.', '3 Drug Discovery Initiative, The University of Tokyo.']","Satoru Nagatoishi, Jose M M Caaveiro, Kouhei Tsumoto, ",Yakugaku zasshi : Journal of the Pharmaceutical Society of Japan,2018,biophysical analysis; drug discovery; isothermal titration calorimetry; small molecule screening; surface plasmon resonance.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30068844
1302,Exploration of Nicotine Metabolism in Paenarthrobacter nicotinovorans pAO1 by Microbial Proteomics,"Proteomics, or the large-scale study of proteins, is a post-genomics field that, together with transcriptomics and metabolomics, has moved the study of bacteria to a new era based on system-wide understanding of bacterial metabolic and regulatory networks. The study of bacterial proteins or microbial proteomics has found a wide array of applications in many fields of microbiology, from food, clinical, and industrial microbiology to microbial ecology and physiology. The current chapter makes a brief technical introduction into the available approaches for the large-scale study of bacterial proteins using mass-spectrometry. Furthermore, the advantages and disadvantages of using bacteria for proteomics studies are indicated as well as several example studies where MS-based bacterial proteomics had a fundamental role in deciphering the scientific question. Finally, the proteomics study of nicotine catabolism in Paenarthrobacter nicotinovorans pAO1 using nanoLC-MS/MS is given as an in-depth example for possible applications of microbial proteomics.The nicotine degradation pathway functioning in Paenarthrobacter nicotinovorans is encoded by the catabolic megaplasmid pAO1 that contains about 40 nicotine-related genes making out the nic-gens cluster. Despite the promising biotechnological potential for the production of green-chemicals, only half of the nic-genes have been experimentally linked to nicotine. In an attempt to systematically identify all the proteins involved in nicotine degradation, a gel-based proteomics approach was used to identify a total of 801 proteins when Paenarthrobacter nicotinovorans was grown on three carbon sources: citrate, nicotine and nicotine and citrate. The differences in protein abundance showed that the bacterium is able to switch between deamination and demethylation in the lower nicotine pathway based on the available C source. Several pAO1 putative genes including a hypothetical polyketide cyclase have been shown to have a nicotine-dependent expression and we hypothesize that the polyketide cyclase would hydrolyze the N1-C6 bond from the pyridine ring with the formation of alpha-keto-glutaramate. Two chromosomal proteins, a malate dehydrogenase, and a D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase were shown to be strongly upregulated when nicotine was the sole carbon source and could be related to the production of the alpha-keto-glutaramate by the polyketide cyclase.","['1 BioActive Group, Department of Biology, Alexandru Ioan Cuza University of Iaşi, Iasi, Romania. marius.mihasan@uaic.ro.', '2 Biochemistry & Proteomics Group, Department of Chemistry & Biomolecular Science, Clarkson University, Potsdam, NY, USA. marius.mihasan@uaic.ro.', '3 BioActive Group, Department of Biology, Alexandru Ioan Cuza University of Iaşi, Iasi, Romania.', '4 Biochemistry & Proteomics Group, Department of Chemistry & Biomolecular Science, Clarkson University, Potsdam, NY, USA.']","Marius Mihăşan, Cornelia Babii, Roshanak Aslebagh, Devika Channaveerappa, Emmalyn J Dupree, Costel C Darie, ",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,2019,Mass spectrometry; Microbial proteomics; Nicotine metabolism; Paenarthrobacter nicotinovorans.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31347068
1303,Recent Developments and Applications of Photoconjugation Chemistry,"Understanding of biological systems has always been the general interest in chemical biology, and chemical modifications of biomolecules are often required to elucidate their functions and properties. There has thus been a rapid development of covalent chemistries for the modification of macromolecules. Among these strategies, photochemistry provides the advantage of using biocompatible light as an energy source to trigger bioconjugation reactions; this circumvents the use of toxic reagents (e.g. metal catalysts and chelating ligands). Light-induced chemistry can achieve precise spatial and temporal conjugation of biomolecules in their native environment.","['1 Department of Chemical Biology College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences Key Laboratory of Bioorganic Chemistry and Molecular Engineering of Ministry of Education Synthetic and Functional Biomolecules Center and Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences Peking University, Beijing 100871, China.', '2 Department of Chemical Biology College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences Key Laboratory of Bioorganic Chemistry and Molecular Engineering of Ministry of Education Synthetic and Functional Biomolecules Center and Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences Peking University, Beijing 100871, China;, Email: xglei@pku.edu.cn.']","Fan Xiao, Xiaoyun Zhang, Xiaoguang Lei, ",Chimia,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30514421
1304,Label-free optical detection of bioelectric potentials using electrochromic thin films,"Understanding how a network of interconnected neurons receives, stores, and processes information in the human brain is one of the outstanding scientific challenges of our time. The ability to reliably detect neuroelectric activities is essential to addressing this challenge. Optical recording using voltage-sensitive fluorescent probes has provided unprecedented flexibility for choosing regions of interest in recording neuronal activities. However, when recording at a high frame rate such as 500 to 1,000 Hz, fluorescence-based voltage sensors often suffer from photobleaching and phototoxicity, which limit the recording duration. Here, we report an approach called electrochromic optical recording (ECORE) that achieves label-free optical recording of spontaneous neuroelectrical activities. ECORE utilizes the electrochromism of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) thin films, whose optical absorption can be modulated by an applied voltage. Being based on optical reflection instead of fluorescence, ECORE offers the flexibility of an optical probe without suffering from photobleaching or phototoxicity. Using ECORE, we optically recorded spontaneous action potentials in cardiomyocytes, cultured hippocampal and dorsal root ganglion neurons, and brain slices. With minimal perturbation to cells, ECORE allows long-term optical recording over multiple days.","['1 Department of Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.', '2 Department of Neurosurgery, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.', '3 Department of Physics, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720.', '4 Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94720.', '5 Department of Physics, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720; bcui@stanford.edu hm@berkeley.edu.', '6 Department of Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305; bcui@stanford.edu hm@berkeley.edu.']","Felix S Alfonso, Yuecheng Zhou, Erica Liu, Allister F McGuire, Yang Yang, Husniye Kantarci, Dong Li, Eric Copenhaver, J Bradley Zuchero, Holger Müller, Bianxiao Cui, ",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2020,PEDOT:PSS; action potential; electrochromic; neurons; optical electrophysiology.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32632007
1305,Quantum theory of mass potentials,"Probabilistic formalism of quantum mechanics is used to quantitatively link the global scale mass potential with the underlying electrical activity of excitable cells. Previous approaches implemented methods of classical physics to reconstruct the mass potential in terms of explicit physical models of participating cells and the volume conductor. However, the multiplicity of cellular processes with extremely intricate mixtures of deterministic and random factors prevents the creation of consistent biophysical parameter sets. To avoid the uncertainty inherent in physical attributes of cell ensembles, we undertake here a radical departure from deterministic equations of classical physics, instead applying the probabilistic reasoning of quantum mechanics. Crucial steps include: (1) the relocation of the elementary bioelectric sources from a cellular to a molecular level; (2) the creation of microscale particle models in terms of a non-homogenous birth-and-death process. To link the microscale processes with macroscale potentials, time-frequency analysis was applied for estimation of the empirical characteristic functions for component waveforms of electroencephalogram (EEG), eye-blink electromyogram (EMG), and electrocardiogram (ECG). We describe universal models for the amplitude spectra and phase functions of functional components of mass potentials. The corresponding time domain relationships disclose the dynamics of mass potential components as limit distribution functions produced by specific microscale transients. The probabilistic laws governing the microscale machinery, founded on an empirical basis, are presented. Computer simulations of particle populations with time dependent transition probabilities reveal that hidden deterministic chaos underlies development of the components of mass potentials. We label this kind of behaviour ""transient deterministic chaos"".","['1 Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia.', '2 Department of Psychology, Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, United States of America.']","Dmitriy Melkonian, Terry Blumenthal, Edward Barin, ",PloS one,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29975693
1306,Value of high-density mapping in the electrophysiology laboratory,"Purpose of review:
      
    

    
      This article uses three commonly encountered clinical scenarios to highlight the value of high-density mapping in the electrophysiology laboratory for the identification of the circuits and substrates during catheter ablation of complex arrhythmias. Recent findings:
      
    

    
      High-density mapping gathered with a multielectrode catheter, with its smaller individual electrode size and closer interelectrode spacing, helps during ablation procedures in a number of ways. When high-density mapping is performed during tachycardia, the characterization of macro-reentrant circuits is better. When there is suspicion of a change in tachycardia during mapping or ablation, the threshold of remapping is significantly lower because of the speed of remapping. When mapping is done during sinus rhythm (substrate mapping), the identification of true scar is more accurate. Lastly, when extensive ablation of a critical isthmus fails to terminate a tachycardia, high-density mapping may reveal the gap(s) along the ablation line and may provide an alternative approach for ablation. Summary:
      
    

    
      High-density mapping shows promises of improving procedural outcomes with shorter procedural times.","['1 Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, USA.']","Mark J Shen, Bradley P Knight, ",Current opinion in cardiology,2019 Jan,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30325814
1307,Molecular biology at the cutting edge: A review on CRISPR/CAS9 gene editing for undergraduates,"Disrupting a gene to determine its effect on an organism's phenotype is an indispensable tool in molecular biology. Such techniques are critical for understanding how a gene product contributes to the development and cellular identity of organisms. The explosion of genomic sequencing technologies combined with recent advances in genome-editing techniques has elevated the possibilities of genetic manipulations in numerous organisms in which these experiments were previously not readily accessible or possible. Introducing the next generation of molecular biologists to these emerging techniques is key in the modern biology classroom. This comprehensive review introduces undergraduates to CRISPR/Cas9 editing and its uses in genetic studies. The goals of this review are to explain how CRISPR functions as a prokaryotic immune system, describe how researchers generate mutations with CRISPR/Cas9, highlight how Cas9 has been adapted for new functions, and discuss ethical considerations of genome editing. Additionally, anticipatory guides and questions for discussion are posed throughout the review to encourage active exploration of these topics in the classroom.

1308,A three-dimensional phase-field model for multiscale modeling of thrombus biomechanics in blood vessels,"Mechanical interactions between flowing and coagulated blood (thrombus) are crucial in dictating the deformation and remodeling of a thrombus after its formation in hemostasis. We propose a fully-Eulerian, three-dimensional, phase-field model of thrombus that is calibrated with existing in vitro experimental data. This phase-field model considers spatial variations in permeability and material properties within a single unified mathematical framework derived from an energy perspective, thereby allowing us to study effects of thrombus microstructure and properties on its deformation and possible release of emboli under different hemodynamic conditions. Moreover, we combine this proposed thrombus model with a particle-based model which simulates the initiation of the thrombus. The volume fraction of a thrombus obtained from the particle simulation is mapped to an input variable in the proposed phase-field thrombus model. The present work is thus the first computational study to integrate the initiation of a thrombus through platelet aggregation with its subsequent viscoelastic responses to various shear flows. This framework can be informed by clinical data and potentially be used to predict the risk of diverse thromboembolic events under physiological and pathological conditions.","['1 Division of Applied Mathematics, Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island, United States of America.', '2 Department of Biomedical Engineering, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, United States of America.']","Xiaoning Zheng, Alireza Yazdani, He Li, Jay D Humphrey, George E Karniadakis, ",PLoS computational biology,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32343724

Therefore, we present here a mechanics-based protocol to probe the influence of gap junction connexin 43 (Cx43) has on endothelial biomechanics by exposing confluent endothelial monolayers to a known Cx43 inhibitor 2,5-dihydroxychalcone (chalcone) and measuring the impact this inhibitor has on tractions and intercellular stresses. We present representative results, which show a decrease in both tractions and intercellular stresses under a high chalcone dosage (2 µg/mL) when compared to control. This protocol can be applied to not just Cx43, but also other gap junctions as well, assuming the appropriate inhibitor is used. We believe this protocol will be useful in the fields of cardiovascular and mechanobiology research.","['1 Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, University of Central Florida.', '2 Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, University of Central Florida; Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences, College of Medicine, University of Central Florida; rstewardjr@ucf.edu.']","Md Mydul Islam, Robert L Steward Jr, ",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31633688

Understanding how mechanical signals are processed in multicellular model systems is critical for connecting cellular processes to tissue- and organism-level responses.

Microfluidic platforms, a subgroup of microsystems that use liquid flow for manipulation of objects, are a promising tool for studying mechanobiology of small model organisms due to their size scale and ease of customization.

The period covered starts with Bernstein's formulation of the membrane hypothesis and the measurement of the nerve and muscle action potential. Technical innovations make discoveries possible. This was the case with the use of the squid giant axon, allowing the insertion of ""large"" intracellular electrodes and derivation of transmembrane potentials. Application of the newly developed voltage clamp method for measuring ionic currents, resulted in the formulation of the ionic theory. At the same time transmembrane measurements were made possible in smaller cells by the introduction of the microelectrode. An improvement of this electrode was the next major (r)evolution. The patch electrode made it possible to descend to the molecular level and record single ionic channel activity. The patch technique has been proven to be exceptionally versatile. In its whole-cell configuration it was the solution to measure voltage clamp currents in small cells.

The risk evaluation of a new compound is costly and can take a long time, which often hinders the development of new drugs. Here, we establish a high-resolution, multiscale computational model to quickly assess the cardiac toxicity of new and existing drugs. The input of the model is the drug-specific current block from single cell electrophysiology; the output is the spatio-temporal activation profile and the associated electrocardiogram. We demonstrate the potential of our model for a low-risk drug, ranolazine, and a high-risk drug, quinidine: For ranolazine, our model predicts a prolonged QT interval of 19.4% compared with baseline and a regular sinus rhythm at 60.15 beats per minute. For quinidine, our model predicts a prolonged QT interval of 78.4% and a spontaneous development of torsades de pointes both in the activation profile and in the electrocardiogram. Our model reveals the mechanisms by which electrophysiological abnormalities propagate across the spatio-temporal scales, from specific channel blockage, via altered single cell action potentials and prolonged QT intervals, to the spontaneous emergence of ventricular tachycardia in the form of torsades de pointes. Our model could have important implications for researchers, regulatory agencies, and pharmaceutical companies on rationalizing safe drug development and reducing the time-to-market of new drugs.","['1 Department of Mechanical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', '2 Dassault Systèmes Simulia Corporation, Johnston, RI, USA.', '3 Departments of Mechanical Engineering, Bioengineering, and Cardiothoracic Surgery, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.']","Francisco Sahli Costabal, Jiang Yao, Ellen Kuhl, ",International journal for numerical methods in biomedical engineering,2018 May,arrhythmia; cardiac toxicity; drugs; electrophysiology; finite element analysis; torsades de pointes.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29424967

Wave-shape classification is performed based on a multi-label window discrimination approach.

Hardware implementation of the on-implant online spike sorter for 512 channels of concurrent extra-cellular neural signals is reported, with an average classification accuracy of ~88%.

Both enzymes utilize a fascinating modular architecture in which the synthetic intermediates are covalently attached to a peptidyl- or acyl-carrier protein that is delivered to catalytic domains for natural product elongation, modification, and termination. An investigation of the structural mechanism therefore requires trapping the often transient interactions between the carrier and catalytic domains.

Biomarkers play an important role in assisting clinicians and health care providers in cancer diagnosis and treatment follow-up. In spite of years of research and the discovery of thousands of candidate cancer biomarkers, only a few have transitioned to routine usage in the clinic. This review highlights advances in proteomics technologies that have enabled high rates of discovery of candidate cancer biomarkers and evaluates integration with other omics technologies to improve their progress through to validation and clinical translation. Furthermore, it gauges the role of metabolomics technology in cancer biomarker research and assesses it as a complementary tool in aiding cancer biomarker discovery and validation.","['1 Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, 3052, Australia.']","Anubhav Srivastava, Darren John Creek, ",Proteomics,2019 May,biomarkers; cancer; diagnosis; metabolomics; proteomics.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30353665

While quantitatively abundant lipid species serve fundamental roles in cell structure and energy metabolism, thousands of structurally-distinct, quantitatively minor species may serve as important regulators of cellular processes. Historically, a complete understanding of the biological roles of these lipids has been limited by a lack of sensitive, discriminating analytical techniques. The class of sphingolipids alone, for example, is known to consist of over 600 different confirmed species, but is likely to include tens of thousands of metabolites with potential biological significance. Advances in mass spectrometry (MS) have improved the throughput and discrimination of lipid analysis, allowing for the determination of detailed lipid profiles in large cohorts of clinical samples. Databases emerging from these studies will provide a rich resource for the identification of novel biomarkers and for the discovery of potential drug targets, analogous to that of existing genomics databases. In this review, we will provide an overview of the field of sphingolipidomics, and will discuss some of the challenges and considerations facing the generation of robust lipidomics databases.","['1 Department of Pharmacology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, 117597, Singapore.', '2 Singapore Lipidomics Incubator (SLING), Department of Biochemistry, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', '3 Department of Pharmacology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, 117597, Singapore; Department of Biology, San Diego State University, San Diego, CA, USA.

1326,MSE for Label-Free Absolute Protein Quantification in Complex Proteomes,"Label-free peptide quantification is a promising approach for the large-scale characterization of proteome dynamics at low cost. Here, we describe a method for absolute label-free quantification using an untargeted approach for peptide fragmentation referred to as MSE. We show that spiked external standards provide sufficient accuracy for the quantification of proteins in complex samples resulting in similar protein quantification results as spectral counting. As an advantage, label-free quantification also works for small numbers of samples whereas spectral counting requires large datasets to result in a similar robustness. The sensitivity of protein identification increases significantly when ion mobility separation is included in addition to the standard LC-MS setup in the analysis workflow. Ion mobility decreases sample complexity and serves as an additional separation criterion to align a parent ion with its product ions after MSE fragmentation. As a drawback, quantification of high abundance proteins becomes inaccurate because of detector saturation. We describe here a suitable workflow to achieve good sensitivity for protein quantification and give initial guidance on data interpretation. To achieve good identification and quantification accuracy, the protein amount loaded onto the column should not exceed 400-600 ng. In a dynamic range window of 3-4 orders of magnitude, robust quantification can be obtained with complex samples comprising up to 2000-3000 proteins.","['1 Institute of Biochemistry and Biotechnology, Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg, Weinbergweg 22, 06120, Halle (Saale), Germany.', '2 Institute of Biochemistry and Biotechnology, Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg, Weinbergweg 22, 06120, Halle (Saale), Germany. sacha.baginsky@biochemtech.uni-halle.de.']","Stefan Helm, Sacha Baginsky, ","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2018,In solution digest; Ion mobility separation; Label-free quantification; MSE; Proteome analysis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29086408
1327,Review of recent developments in GC-MS approaches to metabolomics-based research,"Background:
      
    

    
      Metabolomics aims to identify the changes in endogenous metabolites of biological systems in response to intrinsic and extrinsic factors. This is accomplished through untargeted, semi-targeted and targeted based approaches. Untargeted and semi-targeted methods are typically applied in hypothesis-generating investigations (aimed at measuring as many metabolites as possible), while targeted approaches analyze a relatively smaller subset of biochemically important and relevant metabolites. Regardless of approach, it is well recognized amongst the metabolomics community that gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is one of the most efficient, reproducible and well used analytical platforms for metabolomics research. This is due to the robust, reproducible and selective nature of the technique, as well as the large number of well-established libraries of both commercial and 'in house' metabolite databases available. Aim of review:
      
    

    
      This review provides an overview of developments in GC-MS based metabolomics applications, with a focus on sample preparation and preservation techniques. A number of chemical derivatization (in-time, in-liner, offline and microwave assisted) techniques are also discussed. Electron impact ionization and a summary of alternate mass analyzers are highlighted, along with a number of recently reported new GC columns suited for metabolomics. Lastly, multidimensional GC-MS and its application in environmental and biomedical research is presented, along with the importance of bioinformatics. Key scientific concepts of review:
      
    

    
      The purpose of this review is to both highlight and provide an update on GC-MS analytical techniques that are common in metabolomics studies. Specific emphasis is given to the key steps within the GC-MS workflow that those new to this field need to be aware of and the common pitfalls that should be looked out for when starting in this area.","['1 Land and Water, Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), P.O.

The concept of new and regenerated production arose when I applied this method to measure nitrate and ammonium uptake in marine ecosystems. I then showed that enzyme kinetics could be applied to algal nitrogen uptake and used a silicate pump to explain silicate limitation of diatoms in coastal and equatorial upwelling systems. These concepts are now recognized as modern nutrient paradigms in biogeochemical oceanography.

Cellulose is widely distributed in plants, constituting up to 40-50% overall dry weight of the plant biomass. Majorly, microorganisms secrete three types of enzymes such as endoglucanases, exoglucanases, and beta-glucosidase for the hydrolysis of cellulose, contributing to the total cellulase activity. Industrially, the cellulolytic microorganisms are assessed based on their total cellulolytic activities. Similarly, total cellulase activity can also be used for the isolation and characterization of the cellulolytic microorganisms. In this chapter, we have specifically discussed about the methods used for the purification and characterization of the total cellulase activities of the microorganisms such as filter paper assay and cellulase zymogram assay. Our present chapter can be used as primer for characterizing cellulolytic abilities of cellulose-degrading microorganisms.","['1 Department of Biology, Lakehead University, Thunder Bay, ON, Canada.', '2 Department of Biology, Lakehead University, Thunder Bay, ON, Canada. wqin@lakeheadu.ca.']","Ayyappa Kumar Sista Kameshwar, Wensheng Qin, ","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2018,Cellulose; Endoglucanase; Exoglucanases and β-glucosidases; Total cellulolytic ability.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29856059

As a result, multi-omics analyses-which take advantage of these technologies in genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and other omics areas-have been proposed and heralded as the key to advancing precision medicine in the clinic. In the field of precision oncology, genomics approaches, and, more recently, other omics analyses have helped reveal several key mechanisms in cancer development, treatment resistance, and recurrence risk, and several of these findings have been implemented in clinical oncology to help guide treatment decisions. However, truly integrated multi-omics analyses have not been applied widely, preventing further advances in precision medicine.

Therefore, a comprehensive and systematic approach to quality control is an essential requirement to inspire confidence in the generated results. A typical mass spectrometry experiment consists of multiple different phases including the sample preparation, liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, and bioinformatics stages. We review potential sources of variability that can impact the results of a mass spectrometry experiment occurring in all of these steps, and we discuss how to monitor and remedy the negative influences on the experimental results. Furthermore, we describe how specialized quality control samples of varying sample complexity can be incorporated into the experimental workflow and how they can be used to rigorously assess detailed aspects of the instrument performance.","['1 Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.', '2 Biomedical Informatics Research Center Antwerp (Biomina), University of Antwerp/Antwerp University Hospital, Edegem, Belgium.', '3 Division of Molecular Biology and Human Genetics, Stellenbosch University Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Tygerberg Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa.', '4 VIB Proteomics Core, Ghent, Belgium.', '5 VIB-UGent Center for Medical Biotechnology, Ghent, Belgium.', '6 Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Department of Biochemistry, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', '7 Bioinformatics Institute Ghent, Ghent University, Zwijnaarde, Belgium.']","Wout Bittremieux, David L Tabb, Francis Impens, An Staes, Evy Timmerman, Lennart Martens, Kris Laukens, ",Mass spectrometry reviews,2018 Sep,mass spectrometry; proteomics; quality control.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28802010
1335,Multisite Intracellular Recordings by MEA,"The enormous advances made over the last 50 years in materials science, microelectronics, and nanoelectronics, together with the acknowledgment that substrate-integrated planar multielectrode arrays (MEA) are limited to recording of extracellular field potentials (FPs) rather than the entire electrophysiological signaling repertoire of the brain, have prompted a number of laboratories to merge the advantages of planar MEA technologies (non-damaging and durable) with those of the classical sharp and patch electrodes for intracellular recordings. Unlike extracellular planar electrode-based MEAs, the new generation of three-dimensional (3D) vertical nanoelectrodes are designed to functionally penetrate the plasma membrane of cultured cells and operate in a similar manner to classical intracellular microelectrodes. Although only approximately 10 years has elapsed since the development of the first vertical 3D nanostructure-based MEAs, this technology has progressed to enable recordings of attenuated intracellular action potentials (APs) and synaptic potentials from individual neurons, cardiomyocytes, and striated myotubes. Furthermore, recently the scaling advantages of nanochip/microchip fabrication technologies enabled simultaneously intracellular recordings of APs from hundreds of cultured cardiomyocytes, thus heralding a new milestone in MEA technology.In this chapter we present the earliest and today's cutting-edge achievements of this ""young vertical nano-sensors MEA technology"" at the single-cell and network levels, explain the biophysical principles and the various configurations used to form functional nanoelectrode/cell hybrids, and describe the quality and characteristic features of the recorded intracellular APs and subthreshold synaptic potentials by the vertical nanoelectrode-based MEA. Basic cell-biological mechanisms that curtail the length of time intracellular access by the nanoelectrodes are discussed, and approaches to overcome this problem are offered.Recent development of biotechnologies that use induced human pluripotent stem cells taken from healthy subjects and patients, and in vitro drug screening for the development of personalized medicine as well as basic brain research will benefit tremendously from the use of MEAs that record the entire brain electrophysiological signaling repertoire from individual cells within an operational network rather than only extracellular FPs.","['1 Department of Neurobiology, The Alexander Silberman Institute of Life Science, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel.

      Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play an essential role in the communication between cells and transport of diagnostically significant molecules. A wide diversity of approaches utilizing different biochemical properties of EVs and a lack of accepted protocols make data interpretation very challenging. Scope of review:
      
    

    
      This review consolidates the data on the classical and state-of-the-art methods for isolation of EVs, including exosomes, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each method. Various characteristics of individual methods, including isolation efficiency, EV yield, properties of isolated EVs, and labor consumption are compared. Major conclusions:
      
    

    
      A mixed population of vesicles is obtained in most studies of EVs for all used isolation methods. The properties of an analyzed sample should be taken into account when planning an experiment aimed at studying and using these vesicles. The problem of adequate EVs isolation methods still remains; it might not be possible to develop a universal EV isolation method but the available protocols can be used towards solving particular types of problems.

1343,A Pilot Exploratory Proteomics Investigation of Mental Fatigue and Mental Energy,"Fatigue is a common and poorly understood problem that impacts approximately 45% of the United States (US) population. Fatigue has also been associated with fatigue-related driving accidents, school absences, decline in school performance and negative health outcomes. Fatigue has been linked to many diseases and is consistently underreported in medical care. Despite these high financial and societal costs, fatigue is a poorly understood problem and there is no consensus on how to measure fatigue. Proteomics is one of the most unbiased approach to measure differences in the protein levels from various biological fluids in two conditions, i.e. before and after mental exercise, aka fatigue. There are, however, challenges associated with such analyses: proteomics experiments are usually expensive and time consuming and also require a large number of participants. Here, we performed a proteomics experiment of three (pre- and post-fatigue) samples and also three matched controls (pre- and post-non-fatigue). We found no particular protein that has significant changes in fatigue sample upon treatment. We did note a potential association between changes in mental energy and Annexin A1. However, the study has value simply because it is an extra study in the field of fatigue, but also allows other to correlate our results with their results.","['1 Biochemistry & Proteomics Group, Department of Chemistry & Biomolecular Science, Clarkson University, Potsdam, NY, USA.', '2 Applied Physiology and Psychology Lab, Department of Physical Therapy, Clarkson University, Potsdam, NY, USA.', '3 Applied Physiology and Psychology Lab, Department of Physical Therapy, Clarkson University, Potsdam, NY, USA. aboolani@clarkson.edu.']","Emmalyn J Dupree, Aurora Goodwin, Costel C Darie, Ali Boolani, ",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,2019,Mass spectrometry; Mental energy; Mental fatigue; Proteomics.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31347074

1346,A Biophysical Perspective on Enzyme Catalysis,"Even after a century of investigation, our understanding of how enzymes work remains far from complete. In particular, several factors that enable enzymes to achieve high catalytic efficiencies remain only poorly understood. A number of theories have been developed, which propose or reaffirm that enzymes work as structural scaffolds, serving to bring together and properly orient the participants so that the reaction can proceed; therefore, leading to enzymes being viewed as only passive participants in the catalyzed reaction. A growing body of evidence shows that enzymes are not rigid structures but are constantly undergoing a wide range of internal motions and conformational fluctuations. In this Perspective, on the basis of studies from our group, we discuss the emerging biophysical model of enzyme catalysis that provides a detailed understanding of the interconnection among internal protein motions, conformational substates, enzyme mechanisms, and the catalytic efficiency of enzymes. For a number of enzymes, networks of conserved residues that extend from the surface of the enzyme all the way to the active site have been discovered. These networks are hypothesized to serve as pathways of energy transfer that enables thermodynamical coupling of the surrounding solvent with enzyme catalysis and play a role in promoting enzyme function. Additionally, the role of enzyme structure and electrostatic effects has been well acknowledged for quite some time. Collectively, the recent knowledge gained about enzyme mechanisms suggests that the conventional paradigm of enzyme structure encoding function is incomplete and needs to be extended to structure encodes dynamics, and together these enzyme features encode function including catalytic rate acceleration.","['1 Department of Biochemistry & Cellular and Molecular Biology , University of Tennessee , Knoxville , Tennessee 37996 , United States.']","Pratul K Agarwal, ",Biochemistry,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30507164
1347,Multidimensional Hierarchical Fabric-Based Supercapacitor with Bionic Fiber Microarrays for Smart Wearable Electronic Textiles,"Flexible textile-based supercapacitors (SCs) have attracted a lot of attention, with the artificial intelligence technology and smart wearable electronic textiles developing rapidly. However, energy-storage performance of common textile-based SCs is always restricted with the low-dimensional substrates (i.e., one-dimensional fibers or two-dimensional fabrics), and hence flexible textile-based SCs with multifarious hierarchical substrates are highly desired. Herein, a multidimensional hierarchical fabric electrode model with a bionic fiber microarray structure has been designed, inspired by the ""grasp effect"" of the sophisticated arrangement structures of hedgehog spines, and the bionic assembled SCs exhibit an enhanced specific areal capacitance (245.5 mF/cm2 at 1 mV/cm2), compared with the planar fabric-based SCs (41.6 mF/cm2), and a high energy density (21.82 μWh/cm2 at 0.4 mW/cm2). Besides, the SCs also show a stable capacitance ratio of 83.9% after 10 000 cycles and a mere capacitance loss under different bending states. As a proof of concept, an all-fabric smart electronic switch is fabricated with self-power and wearable properties, along with some other trial applications. Such a hierarchical fabric with a bionic fiber microarray structure is believed to enhance the performance of the assembled SCs. We foresee that the multidimensional hierarchical fabric would bring more promising prospects for flexible textile-based energy-storage systems and be used in smart wearable textile applications.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Zengqing Li, Yulong Ma, Lihong Wang, Xianjing Du, Shifeng Zhu, Xiansheng Zhang, Lijun Qu, Mingwei Tian, ",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019,bionic fiber micro-array structure; flexible textile-based supercapacitors; high specific capacitance; multidimensional hierarchical fabric; smart wearable.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31713408

Harnessing this technology platform for chem/bio sensing scenarios is an appealing opportunity enabling ultra-sensitive detection schemes. This is further facilliated by the progress in fabrication, miniaturization and integration of visible and infrared quantum photonics. Especially, the combination of efficient single-photon sources together with waveguiding/sensing structures, serving as active optical transducer, as well as advanced detector materials is promising integrated quantum photonic chem/bio sensors. Besides the intrinsic molecular selectivity and non-destructive character of visible and infrared light based sensing schemes, chem/bio sensors taking advantage of non-classical light sources promise sensitivities beyond the standard quantum limit. In the present review, recent achievements towards on-chip chem/bio quantum photonic sensing platforms based on N00N states are discussed along with appropriate recognition chemistries, facilitating the detection of relevant (bio)analytes at ultra-trace concentration levels. After evaluating recent developments in this field, a perspective for a potentially promising sensor testbed is discussed for reaching integrated quantum sensing with two fiber-coupled GaAs chips together with semiconductor quantum dots serving as single-photon sources.","['1 Institute of Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry, Ulm University, Albert-Einstein-Allee 11, 89081 Ulm, Germany. boris.mizaikoff@uni-ulm.de.']","J Haas, M Schwartz, U Rengstl, M Jetter, P Michler, B Mizaikoff, ",The Analyst,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29260151

1352,Assembly of Spindles and Asters in Xenopus Egg Extracts,"Here, we provide methods for assembly of mitotic spindles and interphase asters in Xenopus laevis egg extract, and compare them to spindles and asters in the egg and zygote. Classic ""cycled"" spindles are made by adding sperm nuclei to metaphase-arrested cytostatic factor (CSF) extract and inducing entry into interphase extract to promote nucleus formation and DNA replication. Interphase nuclei are then converted to cycled spindles arrested in metaphase by addition of CSF extract. Kinetochores assemble in this reaction and these spindles can segregate chromosomes. CSF spindles are made by addition of sperm nuclei to CSF extract. They are less physiological and lack functional kinetochores but suffice for some applications. Large interphase asters are prepared by addition of artificial centrosomes or sperm nuclei to actin-intact egg extract. These asters grow rapidly to hundreds of microns in radius by branching microtubule nucleation at the periphery, so the aster as a whole is a network of short, dynamic microtubules. They resemble the sperm aster after fertilization, and the asters that grow out of the poles of the mitotic spindle at anaphase. When interphase asters grow into each other they interact and assemble aster interaction zones at their shared boundary. These zones consist of a line (in extract) or disc (in zygotes) of antiparallel microtubule bundles coated with cytokinesis midzone proteins. Interaction zones block interpenetration of microtubules from the two asters, and signal to the cortex to induce cleavage furrows. Their reconstitution in extract allows dissection of the biophysics of spatially regulated cytokinesis signaling.","['1 Department of Systems Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115; Christine_Field@hms.harvard.edu.', '2 Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, Massachusetts 02543.', '3 Department of Systems Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']","Christine M Field, Timothy J Mitchison, ",Cold Spring Harbor protocols,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29437996

      To examine the time course of changes in electromyographic (EMG) and mechanomyographic (MMG) amplitude (AMP) and mean power frequency (MPF) responses during cycle ergometry to exhaustion performed above (CP+10%) and below (CP-10%) critical power (CP) to infer motor unit activation strategies used to maintain power output. Methods:
      
    

    
      Participants performed a 3-min all out test to determine CP, and 2 randomly ordered, continuous rides to exhaustion at CP+10% and CP-10%·V̇O2, EMG AMP, EMG MPF, MMG AMP, MMG MPF, and time to exhaustion (Tlim) were recorded. Responses at CP-10% and CP+10% were analyzed separately. Results:
      
    

    
      At CP-10%, EMG and MMG AMP were significantly greater than the initial 5% timepoint at 100% Tlim. EMG MPF and MMG MPF reflected a downward trend that resulted in no significant difference between timepoints. At CP+10%, EMG AMP was significantly greater than the initial 5% timepoint from 60% to 100% Tlim. MMG AMP was less than the initial 5% timepoint at only 50% Tlim. EMG and MMG MPF were significantly less than the initial 5% timepoint at 20% Tlim and 100% Tlim, respectively. Conclusions:

1354,NormalyzerDE: Online Tool for Improved Normalization of Omics Expression Data and High-Sensitivity Differential Expression Analysis,"Technical biases are introduced in omics data sets during data generation and interfere with the ability to study biological mechanisms. Several normalization approaches have been proposed to minimize the effects of such biases, but fluctuations in the electrospray current during liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry gradients cause local and sample-specific bias not considered by most approaches. Here we introduce a software named NormalyzerDE that includes a generic retention time (RT)-segmented approach compatible with a wide range of global normalization approaches to reduce the effects of time-resolved bias. The software offers straightforward access to multiple normalization methods, allows for data set evaluation and normalization quality assessment as well as subsequent or independent differential expression analysis using the empirical Bayes Limma approach. When evaluated on two spike-in data sets the RT-segmented approaches outperformed conventional approaches by detecting more peptides (8-36%) without loss of precision. Furthermore, differential expression analysis using the Limma approach consistently increased recall (2-35%) compared to analysis of variance. The combination of RT-normalization and Limma was in one case able to distinguish 108% (2597 vs 1249) more spike-in peptides compared to traditional approaches. NormalyzerDE provides widely usable tools for performing normalization and evaluating the outcome and makes calculation of subsequent differential expression statistics straightforward.

1356,Advancing functional and translational microbiome research using meta-omics approaches,"The gut microbiome has emerged as an important factor affecting human health and disease. The recent development of -omics approaches, including phylogenetic marker-based microbiome profiling, shotgun metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics, and metabolomics, has enabled efficient characterization of microbial communities. These techniques can provide strain-level taxonomic resolution of the taxa present in microbiomes, assess the potential functions encoded by the microbial community and quantify the metabolic activities occurring within a complex microbiome. The application of these meta-omics approaches to clinical samples has identified microbial species, metabolic pathways, and metabolites that are associated with the development and treatment of human diseases. These findings have further facilitated microbiome-targeted drug discovery and efforts to improve human health management. Recent in vitro and in vivo investigations have uncovered the presence of extensive drug-microbiome interactions. These interactions have also been shown to be important contributors to the disparate patient responses to treatment that are often observed during disease therapy. Therefore, developing techniques or frameworks that enable rapid screening, detailed evaluation, and accurate prediction of drug/host-microbiome interactions is critically important in the modern era of microbiome research and precision medicine. Here we review the current status of meta-omics techniques, including integrative multi-omics approaches, for characterizing the microbiome's functionality in the context of health and disease. We also summarize and discuss new frameworks for applying meta-omics approaches and microbiome assays to study drug-microbiome interactions.

Researching the microbiome thus has become paramount to understanding additional physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms that may be at play between microbes and their hosts. Cell cultures have traditionally been used to study the microbiome, but in our current day and age, advanced metagenomic techniques - such as 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and whole metagenomic shotgun sequencing - are better able to classify the microorganisms making up the microbiome. Utilizing metagenomics alone, however, does not allow for the study of the more complex effects of the microbiome, such as changes in gene expression and metabolic byproducts. Thus, incorporation of other modalities such as metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics, and metabolomics are needed to further elucidate the extensive intricacies of the skin microbiome.","['1 Department of Dermatology, University of California Davis, Sacramento, CA Pacific Skin Institute, Sacramento, CA. raja.sivamani.md@gmail.com.']","Simran S Sandhu, Aunna Pourang, Raja K Sivamani, ",Dermatology online journal,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31450270
1358,Assaying Oxidative Coupling Activity of CYP450 Enzymes,"Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes are ubiquitous catalysts in natural product biosynthetic schemes where they catalyze numerous different transformations using radical intermediates. In this protocol, we describe procedures to assay the activity of a marine bacterial CYP450 enzyme Bmp7 which catalyzes the oxidative radical coupling of polyhalogenated aromatic substrates. The broad substrate tolerance of Bmp7, together with rearrangements of the aryl radical intermediates leads to a large number of products to be generated by the enzymatic action of Bmp7. The complexity of the product pool generated by Bmp7 thus presents an analytical challenge for structural elucidation. To address this challenge, we describe mass spectrometry-based procedures to provide structural insights into aryl crosslinked products generated by Bmp7, which can complement subsequent spectroscopic experiments. Using the procedures described here, for the first time, we show that Bmp7 can efficiently accept polychlorinated aryl substrates, in addition to the physiological polybrominated substrates for the biosynthesis of polyhalogenated marine natural products.","['1 School of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States; School of Biological Sciences, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States.

1359,A Fluorogenic Assay To Monitor Rho-Dependent Termination of Transcription,"Transcription termination mediated by the ring-shaped, ATP-dependent Rho motor is a multipurpose regulatory mechanism specific to bacteria and constitutes an interesting target for the development of new antibiotics. Although Rho-dependent termination can punctuate gene expression or contribute to the protection of the genome at hundreds of sites within a given bacterium, its exact perimeter and site- or species-specific features remain insufficiently characterized. New advanced approaches are required to explore thoroughly the diversity of Rho-dependent terminators and the complexity of associated mechanisms. Current in vitro analyses of Rho-dependent termination rely on radiolabeling, gel electrophoresis, and phosphorimaging of transcription reaction products and are thus hazardous, inconvenient, and low-throughput. To address these limitations, we have developed the first in vitro assay using a fluorescence detection modality to study Rho-dependent transcription termination. This powerful experimental tool accurately estimates terminator strengths in a matter of minutes and is optimized for a microplate reader format allowing multiplexed characterization of putative terminator sequences and mechanisms or high-throughput screening of new drugs targeting Rho-dependent termination.","['1 Centre de Biophysique Moléculaire , CNRS UPR4301 , rue Charles Sadron , 45071 Orléans cedex 2, France.', ""2 ED 549, Sciences Biologiques & Chimie du Vivant , Université d'Orléans , 45100 Orléans , France."", '3 Centre de Biochimie Structurale, INSERM U 1054, CNRS UMR 5048, Université de Montpellier , 29 rue de Navacelles , 34090 Montpellier , France.']","Cédric Nadiras, Mildred Delaleau, Annie Schwartz, Emmanuel Margeat, Marc Boudvillain, ",Biochemistry,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30624903

A 3rd-generation, AC-DC electropenetrograph (EPG monitor) was used to record stylet probing and ingestion behaviors of adult G. atropunctata on healthy grapevines. This study presents for the first time a complete, updated waveform library for this species, as well as effects of different electropenetrograph settings and adhesives on waveform appearances. Both AC and DC applied signals were used with input resistor (Ri) levels (amplifier sensitivities) of 106, 107, 108 and 109 Ohms, as well as two type of adhesives, conducting silver paint and handmade silver glue. Waveform description, characterization of electrical origins (R versus emf components), and proposed biological meanings of waveforms are reported, as well as qualitative differences in waveform appearances observed with different electropenetrograph settings and adhesives. In addition, a quantitative study with AC signal, using two applied voltage levels (50 and 200 mV) and two Ri levels (107 and 109 Ohms) was performed. Intermediate Ri levels 107 and 108 Ohms provided EPG waveforms with the greatest amount of information, because both levels captured similar proportions of R and emf components, as supported by appearance, clarity, and definition of waveforms. Similarly, use of a gold wire loop plus handmade silver glue provided more definition of waveforms than a gold wire loop plus commercial conducting silver paint. Qualitative/observational evidence suggested that AC applied signal caused fewer aberrant behaviors/waveforms than DC applied signal. In the quantitative study, behavioral components of the sharpshooter X wave were the most affected by changes in Ri and voltage level. Because the X wave probably represents X. fastidiosa inoculation behavior, future studies of X. fastidiosa inoculation via EPG will require carefully determined instrument settings. An intermediate Ri level such as 108 Ohms with low voltage, AC applied signal, and gold wire loop plus silver glue is recommended as the best electropenetrograph methods to conduct future EPG studies of sharpshooter inoculation behaviors on Xf-resistant and -susceptible grapevine.","['1 USDA Agricultural Research Service, San Joaquin Valley Agricultural Sciences Center, 9611 South Riverbend Ave., Parlier, CA 93648-9757, United States.', '2 USDA Agricultural Research Service, San Joaquin Valley Agricultural Sciences Center, 9611 South Riverbend Ave., Parlier, CA 93648-9757, United States.

1368,Bionic hand as artificial organ: Current status and future perspectives,"Even though the hand comprises only 1% of our body weight, about 30% of our central nervous systems (CNS) capacity is related to its control. The loss of a hand thus presents not only the loss of the most important tool allowing us to interact with our environment, but also leaves a dramatic sensory-motor deficit that challenges our CNS. Reconstruction of hand function is therefore not only an essential part of restoring body integrity and functional wholeness but also closes the loop of our neural circuits diminishing phantom sensation and neural pain. If biology fails to restore meaningful function, today we can resort to complex mechatronic replacement that have functional capabilities that in some respects even outperform biological alternatives, such as hand transplantation. As with replantation and transplantations, the challenge of bionic replacement is connecting the target with the CNS to achieve natural and intuitive control.

1369,Integrating Proteomics and Targeted Metabolomics to Understand Global Changes in Histone Modifications,"The chromatin fiber is the control panel of eukaryotic cells. Chromatin is mostly composed of DNA, which contains the genetic instruction for cell phenotype, and histone proteins, which provide the scaffold for chromatin folding and part of the epigenetic inheritance. Histone writers/erasers ""flag"" chromatin regions by catalyzing/removing covalent histone post-translational modifications (PTMs). Histone PTMs chemically contribute to chromatin relaxation or compaction and recruit histone readers to modulate DNA readout. The precursors of protein PTMs are mostly small metabolites. For instance, acetyl-CoA is used for acetylation, ATP for phosphorylation, and S-adenosylmethionine for methylation. Interestingly, PTMs such as acetylation can occur at neutral pH also without their respective enzyme when the precursor is sufficiently concentrated. Therefore, it is essential to differentially quantify the contribution of histone writers/erasers versus the effect of local concentration of metabolites to understand the primary regulation of histone PTM abundance. Aberrant phenotypes such as cancer cells have misregulated metabolism and thus the composition and the modulation of chromatin is not only driven by enzymatic tuning. In this review, the latest advances in mass spectrometry (MS) to analyze histone PTMs and the most adopted quantification methods for related metabolites, both necessary to understand PTM relative changes, are discussed.","['1 Epigenetics Institute, Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']","Johayra Simithy, Simone Sidoli, Benjamin A Garcia, ",Proteomics,2018 Sep,Acetyl-CoA; epigenetics; histone; metabolism; post-translational modifications.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29512899
1370,"Rise of Deep Learning for Genomic, Proteomic, and Metabolomic Data Integration in Precision Medicine","Machine learning (ML) is being ubiquitously incorporated into everyday products such as Internet search, email spam filters, product recommendations, image classification, and speech recognition. New approaches for highly integrated manufacturing and automation such as the Industry 4.0 and the Internet of things are also converging with ML methodologies. Many approaches incorporate complex artificial neural network architectures and are collectively referred to as deep learning (DL) applications. These methods have been shown capable of representing and learning predictable relationships in many diverse forms of data and hold promise for transforming the future of omics research and applications in precision medicine. Omics and electronic health record data pose considerable challenges for DL. This is due to many factors such as low signal to noise, analytical variance, and complex data integration requirements. However, DL models have already been shown capable of both improving the ease of data encoding and predictive model performance over alternative approaches. It may not be surprising that concepts encountered in DL share similarities with those observed in biological message relay systems such as gene, protein, and metabolite networks. This expert review examines the challenges and opportunities for DL at a systems and biological scale for a precision medicine readership.","['1 1 CDS-Creative Data Solutions LLC , Ballwin, Missouri, www.createdatasol.com.', '2 2 Department of Clinical Cancer Prevention, University of Texas MD Anderson , Houston, Texas.', '3 3 Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University , Bangkok, Thailand .', '4 4 Siriraj Metabolomics and Phenomics Center, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University , Bangkok, Thailand .']","Dmitry Grapov, Johannes Fahrmann, Kwanjeera Wanichthanarak, Sakda Khoomrung, ",Omics : a journal of integrative biology,2018 Oct,artificial intelligence; biomarkers; deep learning; machine learning; multiomics data integration; precision medicine.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30124358

1373,Impact of Virtual Patients as Optional Learning Material in Veterinary Biochemistry Education,"Biochemistry and physiology teachers from veterinary faculties in Hannover, Budapest, and Lublin prepared innovative, computer-based, integrative clinical case scenarios as optional learning materials for teaching and learning in basic sciences. These learning materials were designed to enhance attention and increase interest and intrinsic motivation for learning, thus strengthening autonomous, active, and self-directed learning. We investigated learning progress and success by administering a pre-test before exposure to the virtual patients (vetVIP) cases, offered vetVIP cases alongside regular biochemistry courses, and then administered a complementary post-test. We analyzed improvement in cohort performance and level of confidence in rating questions. Results of the performance in biochemistry examinations in 2014, 2015, and 2016 were correlated with the use of and performance in vetVIP cases throughout biochemistry courses in Hannover. Surveys of students reflected that interactive cases helped them understand the relevance of basic sciences in veterinary education. Differences between identical pre- and post-tests revealed knowledge improvement (correct answers: +28% in Hannover, +9% in Lublin) and enhanced confidence in decision making (""I don't know"" answers: -20% in Hannover, -7.5% in Lublin). High case usage and voluntary participation (use of vetVIP cases in Hannover and Lublin >70%, Budapest <1%; response rates in pre-test 72% and post-test 48%) indicated a good increase in motivation for the subject of biochemistry. Despite increased motivation, there was only a weak correlation between performance in final exams and performance in the vetVIP cases. Case-based e-learning could be extended and generated cases should be shared across veterinary faculties.","['1 E-Learning Department, University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Bünteweg 2, 30559 Hannover, Germany.

At this time, constructing a simulated human brain lacks feasibility due to limited experimental data and limited computational resources. However, I suggest that progress toward this goal might be accelerated by working toward an intermediate objective, namely insect brain emulation (IBE). More specifically, this would entail creating biologically realistic simulations of entire insect nervous systems along with more approximate simulations of non-neuronal insect physiology to make ""virtual insects."" I argue that this could be realistically achievable within the next 20 years. I propose that developing emulations of insect brains will galvanize the global community of scientists, businesspeople, and policymakers toward pursuing the loftier goal of emulating the human brain. By demonstrating that WBE is possible via IBE, simulating mammalian brains and eventually the human brain may no longer be viewed as too radically ambitious to deserve substantial funding and resources. Furthermore, IBE will facilitate dramatic advances in cognitive neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and robotics through studies performed using virtual insects.","['1 Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, University of Colorado, Boulder, 2860 Wilderness Place, Boulder, CO, 80301, USA. loco1544@colorado.edu.']","Logan T Collins, ",Biological cybernetics,2019 Dec,Connectomics; Hodgkin–Huxley models; Insects; Whole-brain emulation.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31696303
1375,Learning and Imputation for Mass-spec Bias Reduction (LIMBR),"Motivation:
      
    

    
      Decreasing costs are making it feasible to perform time series proteomics and genomics experiments with more replicates and higher resolution than ever before. With more replicates and time points, proteome and genome-wide patterns of expression are more readily discernible. These larger experiments require more batches exacerbating batch effects and increasing the number of bias trends. In the case of proteomics, where methods frequently result in missing data this increasing scale is also decreasing the number of peptides observed in all samples. The sources of batch effects and missing data are incompletely understood necessitating novel techniques. Results:
      
    

    
      Here we show that by exploiting the structure of time series experiments, it is possible to accurately and reproducibly model and remove batch effects. We implement Learning and Imputation for Mass-spec Bias Reduction (LIMBR) software, which builds on previous block-based models of batch effects and includes features specific to time series and circadian studies. To aid in the analysis of time series proteomics experiments, which are often plagued with missing data points, we also integrate an imputation system. By building LIMBR for imputation and time series tailored bias modeling into one straightforward software package, we expect that the quality and ease of large-scale proteomics and genomics time series experiments will be significantly increased.

Although several types of electrical stimulation devices have received US FDA approval for orthopaedic application, the use of Pulsed Electromagnetic Field (PEMFs) play a central role in joint biophysics. This narrative review aims to summarize the current evidences on the efficacy of PEMF-therapy in the treatment of knee articular diseases. Preclinical studies have assessed the effects of PEMFs on chondrocytes, synoviocytes, articular cartilage explants and animal models, showing positive effects of PEMF-therapy on cells proliferation, extracellular matrix (ECM) production, chondrocytes apoptosis and inflammatory cytokines down-regulation. Currently, PEMF-therapy is a valid option in the conservative management of several knee articular diseases, including early OA, patellofemoral pain syndrome and SONK. PEMFs could be also used as an adjunct after an arthroscopic knee procedure or TKA implantation, in order to control the joint post-operative inflammatory state.","['1 Department of Neuroscience and Organs of Sense, Orthopaedics Section, University of Bari Aldo Moro, Bari, Italy.', '2 National Center For Chemicals, Cosmetic Products And Consumer Protection, National Institute of Health, Rome, Italy.']","G Vicenti, D Bizzoca, V S Nappi, F Moretti, M Carrozzo, V Belviso, B Moretti, ",Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents,Nov-Dec 2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30644277

The significance of a cell-wide understanding of molecular complexes is thus obvious. In comparison to protein-protein interactions, protein-metabolite interactions remain under-studied. However, this has been gradually changing due to technological progress. Here, we focus on the interactions between ligands and receptors, the triggers of signalling events. While the number of small molecules with proven or proposed signalling roles is rapidly growing, most of their protein receptors remain unknown. Conversely, there are numerous signalling proteins with predicted ligand-binding domains for which the identities of the metabolite counterparts remain elusive. Here, we discuss the current biochemical strategies for identifying protein-metabolite interactions and how they can be used to characterize known metabolite regulators and identify novel ones.","['1 Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology, Potsdam, Germany.']","Marcin Luzarowski, Aleksandra Skirycz, ",Journal of experimental botany,2019,Complexes; metabolites; methods; proteins; signalling; small molecules.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31087097

      To provide an in-depth catalog of the salivary proteome and endogenous peptidome of healthy dogs, evaluate proteins and peptides with antimicrobial properties, and compare the most common salivary proteins and peptides between different breed phylogeny groups. Methods:
      
    

    
      36 healthy dogs without evidence of periodontal disease representing four breed phylogeny groups, based upon single nucleotide polymorphism haplotypes (ancient, herding/sighthound, and two miscellaneous groups). Saliva collected from dogs was pooled by phylogeny group and analyzed using nanoscale liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Resulting tandem mass spectra were compared to databases for identification of endogenous peptides and inferred proteins. Results:
      
    

    
      2,491 proteins and endogenous peptides were found in the saliva of healthy dogs with no periodontal disease. All dog phylogeny groups' saliva was rich in proteins and peptides with antimicrobial functions. The ancient breeds group was distinct in that it contained unique proteins and was missing many proteins and peptides present in the other groups. Conclusions and clinical relevance:
      
    

    
      Using a sophisticated nanoscale liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, we were able to identify 10-fold more salivary proteins than previously reported in dogs. Seven of the top 10 most abundant proteins or peptides serve immune functions and many more with various antimicrobial mechanisms were found. This is the most comprehensive analysis of healthy canine saliva to date, and will provide the groundwork for future studies analyzing salivary proteins and endogenous peptides in disease states.","['1 Veterinary Clinical Sciences Department, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Minnesota, Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States of America.', '2 Clinical Sciences Department, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado, United States of America.', '3 Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Biophysics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States of America.', '4 Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biochemistry, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, New York, United States of America.', '5 Department of Veterinary Biomedical Sciences, University of Minnesota, Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States of America.', '6 Minnesota Department of Health, Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States of America.']","Sheila M F Torres, Eva Furrow, Clarissa P Souza, Jennifer L Granick, Ebbing P de Jong, Timothy J Griffin, Xiong Wang, ",PloS one,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29329347

1382,Avoiding selection bias in metabolomics studies: a tutorial,"Background:
      
    

    
      Metabolomics techniques are increasingly applied in epidemiologic research. Many available assays are still relatively expensive and therefore measurements are often performed in small patient population studies such as case series or case-control designs with strong participant selection criteria. Subsequently, metabolomics data are frequently used to assess secondary associations for which the original study was not explicitly designed. Especially in these secondary analyses, there is a risk that the original selection criteria and the conditioning that takes place due to this selection are not properly accounted for which can lead to selection bias. Aim of review:
      
    

    
      In this tutorial, we start with a brief theoretical introduction on the issue of selection bias. Subsequently, we demonstrate how selection bias can occur in metabolomics studies by means of an investigation into associations of metabolites with total body fat in a nested case-control study that was originally designed to study effects of elevated fasting glucose. Key scientific concepts of review:
      
    

    
      We demonstrate that standard analytical methods, such as stratification or adjustment in regression analyses, are not suited to deal with selection bias and may even induce the bias when analysing metabolite-phenotype relationships in selected groups. Finally, we show that inverse probability weighting, also known as survey weighting, can be used in some situations to make unbiased estimates of the outcomes.","['1 Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Department C7-P, Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC), PO Box 9600, 2300 RC, Leiden, The Netherlands. s.c.boone@lumc.nl.', '2 Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Department C7-P, Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC), PO Box 9600, 2300 RC, Leiden, The Netherlands.', '3 Department of Biomedical Data Sciences, Section Medical Statistics and Bioinformatics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', '4 Department of Endocrinology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', '5 Einthoven Laboratory for Experimental Vascular Medicine, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', '6 Department of Human Genetics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', '7 Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.']","S C Boone, S le Cessie, K Willems van Dijk, R de Mutsert, D O Mook-Kanamori, ",Metabolomics : Official journal of the Metabolomic Society,2019,Collider bias; Epidemiology; Inverse probability weighting; Metabolomics; Selection bias.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30830435

In past years, our biochemistry practice classes have been evaluated in reports dealing with experiments and written examinations, as is done in other universities. However, using this methodology, we are not able to evaluate the extent to which students master biochemical experimental skills.

Our exams contributed to a deeper understanding of student skills and could be good tools for evaluating the degree of understanding of the students.

Developed new technology combining bottom-up controlled deposition of peptide planar wafers of a large area and top-down focus ion beam lithography provides direct fabrication of peptide optical integrated circuits. Finding a deep modification of peptide optical properties by reconformation of biological secondary structure from native phase to β-sheet architecture is followed by the appearance of visible fluorescence and unexpected transition from a native passive optical waveguiding to an active one. Original biocompatibility, switchable regimes of waveguiding, and multifunctional nonlinear optical properties make these new peptide planar optical materials attractive for application in emerging technology of lab-on-biochips, combining biomedical photonic and electronic circuits toward medical diagnosis, light-activated therapy, and health monitoring.","['1 Faculty of Engineering, Holon Institute of Technology, 52 Golomb, 5810201, Holon, Israel.', '2 School of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat Aviv, 69978, Tel Aviv, Israel.']","Amir Handelman, Nadezda Lapshina, Boris Apter, Gil Rosenman, ","Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",2018 Feb,passive and active peptide optical waveguides; peptide planar wafers; peptide-integrated optics; reconformation of peptide secondary structures; switching of waveguiding regimes.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29226468
1392,"Use of biochemical miniaturized galleries, rRNA based lateral flow assay and Real Time PCR for Cronobacter spp. confirmation","Identification of Cronobacter represent a major challenge for laboratories testing powdered infant formula (PIF). In the present study, two biochemical galleries and three molecular methods have been applied to confirm 276 Cronobacter spp. and non-Cronobacter isolates from different sources. Using the latest database of API 20 E and ID 32 E biochemical miniaturized kits, 53% and 78% of the isolates were identified respectively. From the available results, total accuracy for Cronobacter detection was in 97% (API 20 E) and 99% (ID 32 E). The three molecular methods were based on rRNA based lateral flow, Real Time PCR combined with either a hybridization or hydrolysis probe. For all three methods total accuracy was more than 99%. A pilot trial using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) correctly identified 58 out of 66 isolates (88%) in DNA mixtures. The results indicate that the commercially available approaches such as ID 32 E, rRNA based lateral flow and Real Time PCR are all suitable for Cronobacter identification at the genus level. The NGS method may become a suitable alternative in the future, provided that the sequence database is improved.","['1 Institute of Food Safety & Analytical Sciences, Nestlé Research Center, Vers-chez-les-Blanc, CH-1000, Lausanne, Switzerland.

1394,Multimodal Imaging in Diabetic Macular Edema,"Throughout ophthalmic history it has been shown that progress has gone hand in hand with technological breakthroughs. In the past, fluorescein angiography and fundus photographs were the most commonly used imaging modalities in the management of diabetic macular edema (DME). Today, despite the moderate correlation between macular thickness and functional outcomes, spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) has become the DME workhorse in clinical practice. Several SD-OCT biomarkers have been looked at including presence of epiretinal membrane, vitreomacular adhesion, disorganization of the inner retinal layers, central macular thickness, integrity of the ellipsoid layer, and subretinal fluid, among others. Emerging imaging modalities include fundus autofluorescence, macular pigment optical density, fluorescence lifetime imaging ophthalmoscopy, OCT angiography, and adaptive optics. Technological advances in imaging of the posterior segment of the eye have enabled ophthalmologists to develop hypotheses about pathological mechanisms of disease, monitor disease progression, and assess response to treatment. Spectral domain OCT is the most commonly performed imaging modality in the management of DME. However, reliable biomarkers have yet to be identified. Machine learning may provide treatment algorithms based on multimodal imaging.","['1 Asociación para Evitar la Ceguera, Hospital Luis Sanchez Bulnes.

1399,Fabrication and Testing of Photonic Thermometers,"In recent years, a push for developing novel silicon photonic devices for telecommunications has generated a vast knowledge base that is now being leveraged for developing sophisticated photonic sensors. Silicon photonic sensors seek to exploit the strong confinement of light in nano-waveguides to transduce changes in physical state to changes in resonance frequency. In the case of thermometry, the thermo-optic coefficient, i.e., changes in refractive index due to temperature, causes the resonant frequency of the photonic device such as a Bragg grating to drift with temperature. We are developing a suite of photonic devices that leverage recent advances in telecom compatible light sources to fabricate cost-effective photonic temperature sensors, which can be deployed in a wide variety of settings ranging from controlled laboratory conditions, to the noisy environment of a factory floor or a residence. In this manuscript, we detail our protocol for the fabrication and testing of photonic thermometers.","['1 Joint Quantum Institute, University of Maryland; Physical Measurement Laboratory, National Institute of Standards and Technology.', '2 Physical Measurement Laboratory, National Institute of Standards and Technology; zeeshan.ahmed@nist.gov.']","Nikolai N Klimov, Zeeshan Ahmed, ",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30417865
1400,Omics Approaches in Sleep-Wake Regulation,"Although sleep seems an obvious and simple behaviour, it is extremely complex involving numerous interactions both at the neuronal and the molecular levels. While we have gained detailed insight into the molecules and neuronal networks responsible for the circadian organization of sleep and wakefulness, the molecular underpinnings of the homeostatic aspect of sleep regulation are still unknown and the focus of a considerable research effort. In the last 20 years, the development of techniques allowing the simultaneous measurement of hundreds to thousands of molecular targets (i.e. 'omics' approaches) has enabled the unbiased study of the molecular pathways regulated by and regulating sleep. In this chapter, we will review how the different omics approaches, including transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, have advanced sleep research. We present relevant data in the framework of the two-process model in which circadian and homeostatic processes interact to regulate sleep. The integration of the different omics levels, known as 'systems genetics', will eventually lead to a better understanding of how information flows from the genome, to molecules, to networks, and finally to sleep both in health and disease.","['1 Center for Advanced Research in Sleep Medicine and Research Center, Hôpital du Sacré-Coeur de Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', '2 Department of Neuroscience, Université de Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', '3 German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', '4 Center for Integrative Genomics, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', '5 Center for Advanced Research in Sleep Medicine and Research Center, Hôpital du Sacré-Coeur de Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada. valerie.mongrain@umontreal.ca.', '6 Department of Neuroscience, Université de Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada. valerie.mongrain@umontreal.ca.']","Emma K O'Callaghan, Edward W Green, Paul Franken, Valérie Mongrain, ",Handbook of experimental pharmacology,2019,Circadian timing system; Epigenomics; Metabolomics; Proteomics; Sleep homeostasis; Transcriptomics.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29796779
1401,Shotgun Lipidomics Combined with Laser Capture Microdissection: A Tool To Analyze Histological Zones in Cryosections of Tissues,"Shotgun analysis provides a quantitative snapshot of the lipidome composition of cells, tissues, or model organisms; however, it does not elucidate the spatial distribution of lipids. Here we demonstrate that shotgun analysis could quantify low-picomole amounts of lipids isolated by laser capture microdissection (LCM) of hundred micrometer-sized histological zones visualized at the cryosections of tissues. We identified metabolically distinct periportal (pp) and pericentral (pc) zones by immunostaining of 20 μm thick cryosections of a healthy mouse liver. LCM was used to ablate, catapult, and collect the tissue material from 10 to 20 individual zones covering a total area of 0.3-0.5 mm2 and containing ca. 500 cells. Top-down shotgun profiling relying upon computational stitching of 61 targeted selective ion monitoring ( t-SIM) spectra quantified more than 200 lipid species from 17 lipid classes including glycero- and glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, cholesterol esters, and cholesterol. Shotgun LCM revealed the overall commonality of the full lipidome composition of pp and pc zones along with significant ( p < 0.001) difference in the relative abundance of 13 lipid species. Follow-up proteomics analyses of pellets recovered from an aqueous phase saved after the lipid extraction identified 13 known and 7 new protein markers exclusively present in pp or in pc zones and independently validated the specificity of their visualization, isolation, and histological assignment.","['1 Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics , Pfotenhauerstrasse 108 , 01307 Dresden , Germany.']","Oskar Knittelfelder, Sofia Traikov, Olga Vvedenskaya, Andrea Schuhmann, Sandra Segeletz, Anna Shevchenko, Andrej Shevchenko, ",Analytical chemistry,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30004672
1402,Towards ultra-wide operation range and high sensitivity: Graphene film based pressure sensors for fingertips,"Remarkable research efforts have been devoted to replicate the tactile sensitivity of human skin. Unfortunately, so far flexible pressure sensors reported barely fit the tactile requirements for fingertips, which could endure a pressure over 100 kPa and also can sense a gentle touch. It is vital to develop flexible pressure sensors which can ensure high sensitivity and wide operation range simultaneously, to satisfy the demands of mimicking the pressure sensing function of fingertips. In this work, a mini-size, light-weight but high-performance graphene film based pressure sensor is presented. Owing to the advanced structure with fluctuations on surface and fluffy-layered structure in cross-section of the graphene film, this pressure sensor shows an extraordinary performance of high sensitivity of 10.39 kPa-1 (0-2 kPa), ultra-wide operation range up to 200 kPa, impressively stable repeatability, high working frequency, rapid response and recovery time. Moreover, the demonstrated results of the detection of traditional Chinese medicine wrist-pulse waveform and the bionic fingertip tactile sensors, suggest the great application potential of the obtain device in biomedical field and bionic skins field.","['1 State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, School of Electronic Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, 610054, PR China.', '2 State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, School of Electronic Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, 610054, PR China.

However, there remains a lack of information on the validity of clinically relevant running gait parameters such as vertical oscillation (VO). The purpose of this study was to assess the validity of measures of VO during running gait using raw depth data, in comparison to a 3D multi-camera motion capture system. Sixteen healthy adults ran on a treadmill at a standard speed of 2.7 m/s. The VO of their running gait was simultaneously collected from raw depth data (Microsoft Kinect v2) and 3D marker data (Vicon multi-camera motion capture system). The agreement between the VO measures obtained from the two systems was assessed using a Bland-Altman plot with 95% limits of agreement (LOA), a Pearson's correlation coefficient (r), and a Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (rc). The depth data from the Kinect v2 demonstrated excellent results across all measures of validity (r = 0.97; rc = 0.97; 95% LOA = -8.0 mm - 8.7 mm), with an average absolute error and percent error of 3.7 (2.1) mm and 4.0 (2.0)%, respectively. The findings of this study have demonstrated the ability of a low cost depth camera and a novel tracking method to accurately measure VO in running gait.","['1 Faculty of Kinesiology, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada.

Electrode design and preparation are important for reproducibility and tolerability. High-definition tDCS uses smaller electrodes that can be arranged in arrays to optimize brain current flow. When intended to be used at home, tDCS devices require specific device design considerations. Computational models of current flow have been validated and support optimization and hypothesis testing. Consensus on the safety and tolerability of tDCS is protocol specific, but medical-grade tDCS devices minimize risk.","['1 From the Department of Biomedical Engineering, The City College of New York of CUNY, New York, NY.']","Dennis Q Truong, Marom Bikson, ",The journal of ECT,2018 Sep,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30095680

1406,Flex Sensor Compensator via Hammerstein-Wiener Modeling Approach for Improved Dynamic Goniometry and Constrained Control of a Bionic Hand,"In this paper, a new control-centric approach is introduced to model the characteristics of flex sensors on a goniometric glove, which is designed to capture the user hand gesture that can be used to wirelessly control a bionic hand. The main technique employs the inverse dynamic model strategy along with a black-box identification for the compensator design, which is aimed to provide an approximate linear mapping between the raw sensor output and the dynamic finger goniometry. To smoothly recover the goniometry on the bionic hand's side during the wireless transmission, the compensator is restructured into a Hammerstein-Wiener model, which consists of a linear dynamic system and two static nonlinearities. A series of real-time experiments involving several hand gestures have been conducted to analyze the performance of the proposed method. The associated temporal and spatial gesture data from both the glove and the bionic hand are recorded, and the performance is evaluated in terms of the integral of absolute error between the glove's and the bionic hand's dynamic goniometry. The proposed method is also compared with the raw sensor data, which has been preliminarily calibrated with the finger goniometry, and the Wiener model, which is based on the initial inverse dynamic design strategy. Experimental results with several trials for each gesture show that a great improvement is obtained via the Hammerstein-Wiener compensator approach where the resulting average errors are significantly smaller than the other two methods. This concludes that the proposed strategy can remarkably improve the dynamic goniometry of the glove, and thus provides a smooth human-robot collaboration with the bionic hand.","['1 School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Engineering Campus, Universiti Sains Malaysia, 14300 Nibong Tebal, Pulau Pinang, Malaysia.', '2 School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Engineering Campus, Universiti Sains Malaysia, 14300 Nibong Tebal, Pulau Pinang, Malaysia. syazreen@usm.my.']","Syed Afdar Ali Syed Mubarak Ali, Nur Syazreen Ahmad, Patrick Goh, ","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019,Hammerstein–Wiener; flex sensor; hand gesture.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31509987

Previous research has modeled how expert biologists incorporate research methods, social or biological context, and analogies when they talk about their research on mechanisms. We used this model as a guiding framework to collect and analyze interview data from four experts. The similarities and differences that emerged from analysis indicate that all experts integrated theoretical knowledge with their research context, methods, and analogies when they explained how phenomena operate, in particular by mapping phenomena to mathematical models; they explored different processes depending on their explanatory aims, but readily transitioned between different perspectives and explanatory models; and they explained thermodynamic and kinetic concepts of relevance to protein folding in different ways that aligned with their particular research methods.

The biosynthesis and transport of these molecules are controlled by a considerable number of proteins, which facilitate spatiotemporal regulation of lipids during different fundamental cellular processes. Although lipids are traditionally considered as molecules for energy storage and as structural components of membranes, they are being increasingly recognized for their signaling roles. There is a growing appreciation of lipids' chemical diversity, which approaches that of proteins. In this Perspective, we discuss recent studies that suggest novel functions for distinct lipid species during different cellular processes. In particular, we discuss findings from our laboratory that illuminate the involvement of ceramides, polyunsaturated triacylglycerols, and very long chain fatty acids in different cellular fates. We also highlight recent innovative methods that have enabled the recognition of previously unknown lipid classes and/or roles of these molecules in different biological processes.

1410,The origins of nitric oxide and peroxynitrite research in Uruguay: 25 years of contributions to the biochemical and biomedical sciences,"In this review, I provide historical background on how nitric oxide (•NO) and peroxynitrite research was originated in Uruguay in the early 90's and how the investigations evolved through over more than two decades within a context related to human biology. This process involved the participation of multiple local investigators, in conjunction with collaborations at the regional (Latin American) and international levels. The discoveries have been integrated with parallel investigations from other research groups worldwide and, have provided a body of knowledge to unravel how the free radical nitric oxide (•NO) can shift its signal transduction action towards oxidative processes via its interactions with superoxide radical (O2•-) to yield peroxynitrite, a strong biological oxidant. The oxidative biochemistry of peroxynitrite involves both direct reactions and the formation of secondary oxidizing species (i.e. hydroxyl radicals (•OH), carbonate radicals (CO3•-) and nitrogen dioxide (•NO2)) that cause oxidative modifications of biomolecules, including thiol oxidation and tyrosine nitration. Due to the intrinsic instability of peroxynitrite in biological systems, its half-life and fate are largely dictated by its reaction kinetics with biotargets. The direct actions of •NO and peroxynitrite in the modulation of intracellular redox processes are disparate, with peroxynitrite typically causing permanent modifications of cellular components and resulting in severe alterations of cell and mitochondrial homeostasis. Herein, I highlight the evolution and progression of •NO and peroxynitrite research in Uruguay during over 25 years of work, emphasizing hypothesis- and mechanistic-oriented biochemical studies and their translation to medically-relevant conditions.","['1 Departamento de Bioquímica, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de la República, Montevideo, Uruguay; Center for Free Radical and Biomedical Research (CEINBIO), Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de la República, Montevideo, Uruguay.

1417,The minimal model of Hahn for the Calvin cycle,"There are many models of the Calvin cycle of photosynthesis in the literature. When investigating the dynamics of these models one strategy is to look at the simplest possible models in order to get the most detailed insights. We investigate a minimal model of the Calvin cycle introduced by Hahn while he was pursuing this strategy. In a variant of the model not including photorespiration it is shown that there exists exactly one positive steady state and that this steady state is unstable. For generic initial data either all concentrations tend to infinity at late times or all concentrations tend to zero at late times. In a variant including photorespiration it is shown that for suitable values of the parameters of the model there exist two positive steady states, one stable and one unstable. For generic initial data either the solution tends to the stable steady state at late times or all concentrations tend to zero at late times. Thus we obtain rigorous proofs of mathematical statements which together confirm the intuitive idea proposed by Hahn that photorespiration can stabilize the operation of the Calvin cycle. In the case that the concentrations tend to infinity we derive formulae for the leading order asymptotics using the Poincaré compactification.","['1 Institut für Mathematik, Johannes Gutenberg-Universität, Staudingerweg 9, 55128 Mainz, Germany.']","Hussein Obeid, Alan D Rendall, ",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,2019,asymptotic behaviour; dynamical system; photosynthesis; stability; steady state.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31137217

1420,Exploration of variations in proteome and metabolome for predictive diagnostics and personalized treatment algorithms: Innovative approach and examples for potential clinical application,"Genome mutually interacts with internal and external environmental factors to result in different phenome that contains two important elements of proteins and metabolites, which link genome to predictive, preventive and personalized medicine (PPPM) or precision medicine (PM). Proteomic variations are the final presentation of the genomic and transcriptomic variations, and are involved in a wide range of variations including copy number of protein, splicing, post-translational modifications, translocation/re-distribution, spatial conformation, and pathway-network systems. Metabolomic variations are the comprehensive results originated from all types of in vivo substances, and are involved in a wide range of alterations of metabolites generated from sugars, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, and metabolic network systems. Currently the studies on variations in proteome and in metabolome are much insufficient in the width and depth in the fields of proteomics and metabolomics. The development of high-throughput, high-sensitivity, and especially high-reproducibility approaches is necessary to maximize the coverage of variations in proteome and in metabolome. The studies of proteomic and metabolomic variations directly result in the discovery of effective biomarkers to clarify molecular mechanisms of a disease, determine reliable therapeutic targets, and benefit precise prediction, diagnosis, and prognosis assessment. It has more important scientific values in PPPM or PM.

1421,Methods to Study the Role of Methionine-Restricted Diet and Methioninase in Cancer Growth Control,"Cancer cells require exogenous methionine for survival and therefore methionine restriction is a promising avenue for treatment. The basis for methionine dependence in cancer cells is still not entirely clear. While the lack of the methionine salvage enzyme methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) is associated with methionine auxotrophy in cancer cells, there are other causes for tumors to require exogenous methionine. Restricting methionine by diet or by enzyme depletion, alone or in combination with certain chemotherapeutics, is a promising antitumor strategy.","['1 Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ, USA.', '2 Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ, USA. bertinoj@cinj.rutgers.edu.']","Shushma Chaturvedi, Joseph R Bertino, ","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2019,Adherent cells; Homocysteine; Methioninase; Methionine; Suspension cultures.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30725403
1422,Improving MetFrag with statistical learning of fragment annotations,"Background:
      
    

    
      Molecule identification is a crucial step in metabolomics and environmental sciences. Besides in silico fragmentation, as performed by MetFrag, also machine learning and statistical methods evolved, showing an improvement in molecule annotation based on MS/MS data. In this work we present a new statistical scoring method where annotations of m/z fragment peaks to fragment-structures are learned in a training step. Based on a Bayesian model, two additional scoring terms are integrated into the new MetFrag2.4.5 and evaluated on the test data set of the CASMI 2016 contest. Results:
      
    

    
      The results on the 87 MS/MS spectra from positive and negative mode show a substantial improvement of the results compared to submissions made by the former MetFrag approach. Top1 rankings increased from 5 to 21 and Top10 rankings from 39 to 55 both showing higher values than for CSI:IOKR, the winner of the CASMI 2016 contest. For the negative mode spectra, MetFrag's statistical scoring outperforms all other participants which submitted results for this type of spectra. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      This study shows how statistical learning can improve molecular structure identification based on MS/MS data compared on the same method using combinatorial in silico fragmentation only. MetFrag2.4.5 shows especially in negative mode a better performance compared to the other participating approaches.","['1 Department Biochemistry of Plant Interactions, Leibniz Institute of Plant Biochemistry, Weinberg 3, Halle (Saale), 06120, Germany. christoph.ruttkies@ipb-halle.de.', '2 Department Biochemistry of Plant Interactions, Leibniz Institute of Plant Biochemistry, Weinberg 3, Halle (Saale), 06120, Germany.', '3 German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig, Deutscher Platz 5e, Leipzig, 04103, Germany.', '4 Institute of Computer Science, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Von-Seckendorff-Platz 1, Halle (Saale), 06099, Germany.']","Christoph Ruttkies, Steffen Neumann, Stefan Posch, ",BMC bioinformatics,2019,Identification; Mass spectrometry; Statistical modeling.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31277571

1428,Proteogenomics: From next-generation sequencing (NGS) and mass spectrometry-based proteomics to precision medicine,"One of the best-established area within multi-omics is proteogenomics, whereby the underpinning technologies are next-generation sequencing (NGS) and mass spectrometry (MS). Proteogenomics has contributed significantly to genome (re)-annotation, whereby novel coding sequences (CDS) are identified and confirmed. By incorporating in-silico translated genome variants in protein database, single amino acid variants (SAAV) and splice proteoforms can be identified and quantified at peptide level. The application of proteogenomics in cancer research potentially enables the identification of patient-specific proteoforms, as well as the association of the efficacy or resistance of cancer therapy to different mutations. Here, we discuss how NGS/TGS data are analyzed and incorporated into the proteogenomic framework. These sequence data mainly originate from whole genome sequencing (WGS), whole exome sequencing (WES) and RNA-Seq. We explain two major strategies for sequence analysis i.e., de novo assembly and reads mapping, followed by construction of customized protein databases using such data. Besides, we also elaborate on the procedures of spectrum to peptide sequence matching in proteogenomics, and the relationship between database size on the false discovery rate (FDR). Finally, we discuss the latest development in proteogenomics-assisted precision oncology and also challenges and opportunities in proteogenomics research.","['1 UKM Medical Molecular Biology Institute (UMBI), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, 56000 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', '2 UKM Medical Molecular Biology Institute (UMBI), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, 56000 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

1430,Hierarchical cluster analysis of technical replicates to identify interferents in untargeted mass spectrometry metabolomics,"Mass spectral data sets often contain experimental artefacts, and data filtering prior to statistical analysis is crucial to extract reliable information. This is particularly true in untargeted metabolomics analyses, where the analyte(s) of interest are not known a priori. It is often assumed that chemical interferents (i.e. solvent contaminants such as plasticizers) are consistent across samples, and can be removed by background subtraction from blank injections. On the contrary, it is shown here that chemical contaminants may vary in abundance across each injection, potentially leading to their misidentification as relevant sample components. With this metabolomics study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) of replicate injections (technical replicates) as a methodology to identify chemical interferents and reduce their contaminating contribution to metabolomics models. Pools of metabolites with varying complexity were prepared from the botanical Angelica keiskei Koidzumi and spiked with known metabolites. Each set of pools was analyzed in triplicate and at multiple concentrations using ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). Before filtering, HCA failed to cluster replicates in the data sets. To identify contaminant peaks, we developed a filtering process that evaluated the relative peak area variance of each variable within triplicate injections. These interferent peaks were found across all samples, but did not show consistent peak area from injection to injection, even when evaluating the same chemical sample. This filtering process identified 128 ions that appear to originate from the UPLC-MS system. Data sets collected for a high number of pools with comparatively simple chemical composition were highly influenced by these chemical interferents, as were samples that were analyzed at a low concentration. When chemical interferent masses were removed, technical replicates clustered in all data sets. This work highlights the importance of technical replication in mass spectrometry-based studies, and presents a new application of HCA as a tool for evaluating the effectiveness of data filtering prior to statistical analysis.","['1 Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Patricia A.

1431,Metabolomics analysis and biological investigation of three Malvaceae plants,"Introduction:
      
    

    
      Metabolomics is a fast growing technology that has effectively contributed to many plant-related sciences and drug discovery. Objective:
      
    

    
      To use the non-targeted metabolomics approach to investigate the chemical profiles of three Malvaceae plants, namely Hibiscus mutabilis L. (Changing rose), H. schizopetalus (Dyer) Hook.f. (Coral Hibiscus), and Malvaviscus arboreus Cav. (Sleeping Hibiscus), along with evaluating their antioxidant and anti-infective potential. Methodology:
      
    

    
      Metabolic profiling was carried out using liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (LC-HR-ESI-MS) for dereplication purposes. The chemical composition of the studied plants was further compared by principal component analysis (PCA). The antioxidant and anti-infective properties of their different extracts were correlated to their phytochemical profiles by orthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). Results:
      
    

    
      A variety of structurally different metabolites, mostly phenolics, were characterized. Comparing the distribution pattern of these tentatively identified metabolites among the studied plant species/fractions revealed the chemical uniqueness of the dichloromethane fraction of M. arboreus. Some extracts and fractions of these plants demonstrated noteworthy antioxidant and antitrypanosomal potential; the latter was partly attributed to their anti-protease activities. The active principles of these plants were pinpointed before any laborious isolation steps, to avoid the redundant isolation of previously known compounds. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      This study highlighted the use of the established procedure in exploring the metabolomes of these species, which could be helpful for chemotaxonomic and authentication purposes, and might expand the basis for their future phytochemical analysis. Coupling the observed biological potential with LC-MS data has also accelerated the tracing of their bioactive principles.","['1 Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Deraya University, New Minia, Egypt.', '2 Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Minia University, Minia, Egypt.', '3 Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Minia University, Minia, Egypt.', '4 Department of Biochemistry, University of Toronto, MaRS Centre West, Toronto, ON, Canada.', '5 Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, University of Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', '6 Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Helwan University, Cairo, Egypt.', '7 Department of Computational and Analytical Science, Molecular Discovery Group, Rothamsted Research, Harpenden, UK.']","Omnia Hesham Abdelhafez, Eman Maher Othman, John Refaat Fahim, Samar Yehia Desoukey, Sheila Marie Pimentel-Elardo, Justin R Nodwell, Tanja Schirmeister, Ahmed Tawfike, Usama Ramadan Abdelmohsen, ",Phytochemical analysis : PCA,2020 Mar,Hibiscus; LC-MS; Malvaceae; Malvaviscus; anti-infective; antioxidant; metabolomics.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31390115

In metabolomics, analytical methods play a pivotal role, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS) have proven to be the most suitable and powerful methods. Although NMR exhibits lower sensitivity and resolution compared to MS, NMR's numerous important characteristics far outweigh its limitations. Some of its characteristics include excellent reproducibility and quantitative accuracy, the capability to analyze intact biospecimens, an unparalleled ability to identify unknown metabolites, the ability to trace in-cell and in-organelle metabolism in real time, and the capacity to trace metabolic pathways atom by atom using 2H, 13C, or 15N isotopes. Each of these characteristics has been exploited extensively in numerous studies. In parallel, the field has witnessed significant progress in instrumentation, methods development, databases, and automation that are focused on higher throughput and alleviating the limitations of NMR, in particular, resolution and sensitivity. Despite the advances, however, the high complexity of biological mixtures combined with the limitations in sensitivity and resolution continues to pose major challenges. These challenges need to be dealt with effectively to better realize the potential of metabolomics, in general. As a result, multifaceted efforts continue to focus on addressing the challenges as well as reaping the benefits of NMR-based metabolomics.

1437,CHO-Omics Review: The Impact of Current and Emerging Technologies on Chinese Hamster Ovary Based Bioproduction,"CHO cells are the most prevalent platform for modern bio-therapeutic production. Currently, there are several CHO cell lines used in bioproduction with distinct characteristics and unique genotypes and phenotypes. These differences limit advances in productivity and quality that can be achieved by the most common approaches to bioprocess optimization and cell line engineering. Incorporating omics-based approaches into current bioproduction processes will complement traditional methodologies to maximize gains from CHO engineering and bioprocess improvements. In order to highlight the utility of omics technologies in CHO bioproduction, the authors discuss current applications as well as limitations of genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, fluxomics, glycomics, and multi-omics approaches and the potential they hold for the future of bioproduction. Multiple omics approaches are currently being used to improve CHO bioprocesses; however, the application of these technologies is still limited. As more CHO-omic datasets become available and integrated into systems models, the authors expect significant gains in product yield and quality. While individual omics technologies provide incremental improvements in bioproduction, the authors will likely see the most significant gains by applying multi-omics and systems biology approaches to individual CHO cell lines.","['1 Bioproduction R&D, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Grand Island, USA.']","Gino Stolfa, Matthew T Smonskey, Ryan Boniface, Anna-Barbara Hachmann, Paul Gulde, Atul D Joshi, Anson P Pierce, Scott J Jacobia, Andrew Campbell, ",Biotechnology journal,2018 Mar,CHO; bioproduction; cell line engineering; media development; omics.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29072373

1439,Potential role of the anterior lateral line in sound localization in toadfish ( Opsanus tau),"Male oyster toadfish (Opsanus tau) acoustically attract females to nesting sites using a boatwhistle call. The rapid speed of sound underwater combined with the close proximity of the otolithic organs makes inner ear interaural time differences an unlikely mechanism to localize sound. To determine the role that the mechanosensory lateral line may play in sound localization, microwire electrodes were bilaterally implanted into the anterior lateral line nerve to record neural responses to vibrational stimuli. Highest spike rates and strongest phase-locking occurred at distances close to the fish and decreased as the stimulus was moved further from the fish. Bilateral anterior lateral line neuromasts displayed differential directional sensitivity to incoming vibrational stimuli, which suggests the potential for the lateral line to be used for sound localization in the near field. The present study also demonstrates that the spatially separated neuromasts of the toadfish may provide sufficient time delays between sensory organs for determining sound localization cues. Multimodal sensory input processing through both the inner ear (far field) and lateral line (near field) may allow for effective sound localization in fish.","['1 Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, MA 02543, USA.', '2 Biology Department, University of Minnesota Duluth, Duluth, MN 55812, USA.', '3 Leigh Marine Laboratory, Institute of Marine Science, University of Auckland, Warkworth 0941, New Zealand.', '4 Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, MA 02543, USA amensing@d.umn.edu.']","Emily A Cardinal, Craig A Radford, Allen F Mensinger, ",The Journal of experimental biology,2018,Fish; Mechanosensation; Sensory system.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30266783

1441,Site-Specific Conjugation of Polymers to Proteins,"Conjugation of polymer to protein has been widely employed in therapeutics, medicine, biotechnology, and enzymatic catalysis. The synergistic effect benefits both counterparts and potentially overcomes their inherent limitations. This article reviews the strategies for the site-specific synthesis of well-defined protein-polymer conjugates, aiming to provide a toolbox for the community. First, it is essential to set a definite reactive site on the protein because the position of the reaction site can directly influence the reaction activity and the bioactivity of the protein after modification. The origins of the specific functional groups on protein include the utilization of the unique natural amino acid, mutagenesis to introduce a sole reactive amino acid, chemical modification, noncanonical amino acid incorporation, and enzyme-mediated introduction of functional groups. Second, the main conjugation methods, i.e., ""grafting to"" and ""grafting from"" methods, are summarized and compared with each other. In the ""grafting to"" method, a comprehensive investigation on the reactions used to attach an end functional polymer chain to a protein is conducted according to the position of the target site and its nature. In the ""grafting from"" method, a comparison between the commonly used controlled polymerization, i.e., atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) and reversible addition-fragmentation transfer (RAFT), is surveyed. Further, a special case where a noncovalent bond is adopted to link the protein and polymer together is investigated due to its high specificity and reversibility, typically biotin-(strept)avidin-based interactions and metal-mediated conjugation. Finally, applications of protein-polymer conjugates in drug delivery, biomedicine, biosensor, and the disease-related protein self-assembly are illustrated. This precise review on the conjugation of polymer chain to protein to form well-defined protein-polymer conjugates summarizes the representative strategies and may provide useful cues in the areas of biotechnology, therapeutic drugs, and biomedicine.","['1 Department of Chemistry , The Chinese University of Hong Kong , Shatin, New Territories , Hong Kong , China.', '2 Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at the Microscale, Department of Chemical Physics , University of Science and Technology of China , Hefei , Anhui 230026 , China.']","Yanjing Wang, Chi Wu, ",Biomacromolecules,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29722971

1444,Nonequilibrium Theory of Epigenomic Microphase Separation in the Cell Nucleus,"Understanding the spatial organization of the genome in the cell nucleus is one of the current grand challenges in biophysics. Certain biochemical-or epigenetic-marks that are deposited along the genome are thought to play an important, yet poorly understood, role in determining genome organization and cell identity. The physical principles underlying the interplay between epigenetic dynamics and genome folding remain elusive. Here we propose and study a theory that assumes a coupling between epigenetic mark and genome densities, and which can be applied at the scale of the whole nucleus. We show that equilibrium models are not compatible with experiments and a qualitative agreement is recovered by accounting for nonequilibrium processes that can stabilize microphase separated epigenomic domains. We finally discuss the potential biophysical origin of these terms.","['1 SUPA, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH9 3FD, United Kingdom.', '2 MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH4 2XU, United Kingdom.', '3 Centre for Mathematical Biology, and Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Bath, North Rd, Bath BA2 7AY, United Kingdom.', '4 Dipartimento di Fisica e Astronomia and Sezione INFN, Università degli Studi di Padova, I-35131 Padova, Italy.']","Davide Michieletto, Davide Colì, Davide Marenduzzo, Enzo Orlandini, ",Physical review letters,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31868408

1448,Assessing stakeholder perceptions of the american society for biochemistry and molecular biology accreditation program for baccalaureate degrees,"The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB) began an accreditation program in 2013. The criteria for accreditation of undergraduate programs include sufficient infrastructure - number and expertise of faculty, physical space and equipment, support for faculty and students - and incorporation of core concepts in the curriculum - structure and function of biomolecules; information storage; energy transfer; and quantitative skills. Students in accredited programs are able to have their degrees ASBMB certified by taking an exam focused on knowledge or skills across the four core concept areas. Members of the accreditation committees administered a survey to key stakeholders in the BMB community: undergraduate programs, both those that have applied for accreditation and those that have not; alumni/ae of accredited programs; graduate and professional programs; and employers. The goals of the study were to gauge the success of the program and determine necessary areas of improvement. The results indicate that the major benefits of applying for accreditation are the impetus to gather data and analysis not generally collected, and access to assessment data via the exam. However, stakeholders outside of the undergraduate community showed little awareness of the accreditation program. Additionally, the application process itself was seen to be very time consuming. This feedback will be used to improve the process and engage in further outreach. © 2018 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 46(5):464-471, 2018.","['1 Department of Chemistry, University of Saint Joseph, West Hartford, CT.', ""2 Department of Biology, St. Mary's University of Minnesota, Winona, MN."", '3 Department of Chemistry, Biochemistry & Physics, The University of Tampa, Tampa, FL.', '4 Department of Biochemistry, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA.', '5 Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry, University of San Diego, San Diego, CA.', '6 Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Otterbein University.', '7 Department of Chemistry, Otterbein University, Westerville, OH.', '8 Chemistry Department, Wellesley College, Wellesley, MA.']","Diane M Dean, Debra Martin, L Michael Carastro, Peter J Kennelly, Joseph J Provost, John T Tansey, Adele J Wolfson, ",Biochemistry and molecular biology education : a bimonthly publication of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,2018 Sep,Assessment of educational activities; curriculum assessment; learning and curriculum design; program accreditation; program assessment; scholarship of teaching and learning.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30369038

      Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) is considered a standard care for patients with advanced heart failure. The aim of this work was to study in vitro the effects of direct exposure of the Jarvik 2000 LVAD to 10-MV photon beams. Methods:
      
    

    
      Jarvik 2000 pump was immersed in a siliconized box filled with deionized water. A 30 × 30 × 15 cm RW3 slabs were added forth and back to the box. A treatment plan consisting of a single direct 10 × 10 cm2 field size beam was used to deliver 1000 MU at the center of the pump. During irradiation, the external Flow Maker controller and the lithium battery were positioned away from the beam. Pump parameter data (included voltage, current and frequency) were measured, recorded and analyzed for changes in pump function among baseline, pre-irradiation, during irradiation, post-irradiation and after 6 months. The whole session lasted 6 months. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the repeated measurements. X-ray radiation attenuation was also studied. Results:
      
    

    
      The parameters investigated remained stable over the 6 months; that is, no pump stops, alarms, events, operational changes or abnormalities during the discharge rate of the connected power sources, were encountered, confirmed by the Mann-Whitney U test applied to all sessions (p > 0.1). The measured X-ray attenuation differed from the calculated one by TPS by 34%. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The Jarvik 2000 resulted stable under direct X-ray beam of 10-MV energy. Its strong attenuation, however, can affect dose deposition in the pump in TPS, and it must be taken into account.","['1 Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Chieti ""G. D\'Annunzio"", SS.

Using an electrophysiological tissue model, we first formulate the electrogram array as a convolution of transmembrane currents with a distance kernel. These currents are more local activities and less affected by the heterogeneity in the tissue compared to electrograms. We then deconvolve the distance kernel with the electrograms to reconstruct the transmembrane current. To stabilize the solution of this ill-posed deconvolution, we use spatio-temporal total variation as a regularization. This helps to preserve sharp spatial and temporal deflections in the currents that are of higher importance in LAT estimation. Finally, the maximum negative slope of the reconstructed transmembrane currents are used to estimate the LATs. Instrumental comparison to two reference approaches shows that the proposed approach performs better in estimating the LATs in fractionated electrograms.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Bahareh Abdi, Alle-Jan van der Veen, Natasja M S de Groot, Richard C Hendriks, ",Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

However, peptides with different sequences have different ionization efficiencies, and their intensities in a mass spectrum are not correlated with their abundances. Therefore, various label-free or stable isotope label-based quantitation methods have emerged to assist mass spectrometry to perform comparative proteomic experiments, thus enabling nonbiased identification of thousands of proteins differentially expressed in healthy versus diseased cells. Here, we discuss the most widely used label-free and metabolic-, enzymatic-, and chemical labeling-based proteomic strategies for relative and absolute quantitation. We summarize the specific strengths and weaknesses of each technique in terms of quantification accuracy, proteome coverage, multiplexing capability, and robustness.

      The use of microelectrode array (MEA) recordings is a very effective neurophysiological method because it is able to continuously and noninvasively obtain the spatiotemporal information of electrical activity from many neurons constituting a neural network. Very recently, studies have been published that used MEAs for the measurement of a low-frequency component of electrical activity as an indicator of diverse activity of cultured neurons. The occurrence of low-frequency activities has electrophysiological information that does not include the information from fast spikes. However, there is no in vitro experimental model suitable for measuring the low-frequency activities (slow-waves) for further study. Methods:
      
    

    
      Neural clusters consisting of dozens of neurons were placed directly onto each electrode of an MEA from which fast spikes and slow-waves were measured. Results:
      
    

    
      We obtained sufficient data on the early development patterns of the slow-waves and the spikes measured from many independent neural clusters confirming that the slow-waves occurred first before the emergence of the spikes in the neural clusters. We also showed that changes in the occurrence frequency of the slow-waves for synaptic blockers were measured from a large number of independent cultures. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Microsized neural cluster arrays, which can be combined with conventional MEAs, are suitable for multiple simultaneous recordings of slow-waves. Significance:

1458,Technical note: development and validation of a Monte Carlo tool for analysis of patient-generated photon scatter,"Scattered radiation unavoidably generated in the patient will negatively impact both kilovoltage (KV) and megavoltage (MV) imaging applications. Recently, 'hybrid' methods (i.e. combining analytical and Monte Carlo (MC) techniques) are being investigated as a solution to accurately yet quickly calculate the scattered contribution for both KV and MV images. We have developed a customized MC simulation user code for investigating the individual components of patient-scattered photon fluence, which serves as a valuable tool in this area of research. The MC tool is based on the EGSnrc/DOSXYZnrc user code. The IAUSFL flag options associated with subroutine AUSGAB, combined with LATCH tracking, are used to classify the various interactions of particles with the media. Photons are grouped into six different categories: primary, 1st Compton scatter, 1st Rayleigh scatter, multiple scatter, bremsstrahlung, and positron annihilation. We take advantage of the geometric boundary check in DOSXYZnrc, to write exiting photon particle information to a phase-space file. The tool is validated using homogeneous and heterogeneous phantom configurations with monoenergetic and polyenergetic beams under parallel and divergent beam geometry, comparing MC-simulated exit primary fluence and singly-scattered fluence to corresponding analytical calculations. This MC tool has been validated to separately score the primary and scatter fluence components of the KV and MV imaging applications in the field of radiation therapy. The results are acceptable for the various configurations and beam energies tested here. Overall, the mean percentage differences are less than 0.2% and standard deviations less than 1.6%. This will be a critical test instrument for research in photon scatter applications and particularly for the development of hybrid methods, and is freely available from the authors for research purposes.5.","['1 Division of Medical Physics, CancerCare Manitoba, 675 McDermot Avenue, Winnipeg, MB R3E 0V9, Canada.

1462,"Design, Instrumentation and Usage Protocols for Distributed In Situ Thermal Hot Spots Monitoring in Electric Coils using FBG Sensor Multiplexing","Random wound coils are a key operational element of most electric apparatus in modern industrial systems, including low voltage electric machines. One of the major current bottlenecks in improved exploitation of electrical devices is the high sensitivity of their wound components to in-service thermal stress. The application of conventional thermal sensing methods (e.g., thermocouples, resistance temperature detectors) for thermal condition monitoring of current carrying random wound coils can impose considerable operational limitations due to sensor size, EMI sensitivity and the existence of electrically conductive material in their construction. Another substantial limitation exists in distributed sensing applications and is caused by what is often a considerable length and volume of conventional sensor wiring leads. This paper reports the design of a fiber optic FBG sensing system intended for enabling real-time distributed internal thermal condition monitoring within random wound coils. The procedure of random wound coil instrumentation with the FBG sensing system is reported in a case study on an IEEE standard wound coil representative of those utilized in electrical machines. The reported work also presents and discusses important practical and technical aspects of FBG sensing system implementation and application, including the FBG array geometry design, sensing head and fiber packaging, the sensor array installation and calibration procedure and the use of a commercial interrogation system for obtaining thermal measurements. Finally, the in situ multiplexed FBG sensing system thermal monitoring performance is demonstrated in representative static and dynamic thermal conditions.","['1 School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Manchester.', '2 School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Manchester; Sinisa.Durovic@manchester.ac.uk.']","Anees Mohammed, Siniša Durović, ",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32202517

1468,"Biochemical, biophysical and molecular dynamics studies on the proteoglycan-like domain of carbonic anhydrase IX","Human carbonic anhydrase IX (hCA IX) is a tumour-associated enzyme present in a limited number of normal tissues, but overexpressed in several malignant human tumours. It is a transmembrane protein, where the extracellular region consists of a greatly investigated catalytic CA domain and a much less investigated proteoglycan-like (PG) domain. Considering its important role in tumour biology, here, we report for the first time the full characterization of the PG domain, providing insights into its structural and functional features. In particular, this domain has been produced at high yields in bacterial cells and characterized by means of biochemical, biophysical and molecular dynamics studies. Results show that it belongs to the family of intrinsically disordered proteins, being globally unfolded with only some local residual polyproline II secondary structure. The observed conformational flexibility may have several important roles in tumour progression, facilitating interactions of hCA IX with partner proteins assisting tumour spreading and progression.","['1 Institute of Biostructures and Bioimaging, CNR, via Mezzocannone, 16, 80134, Naples, Italy.', '2 Neurofarba Department, Section of Pharmaceutical and Nutriceutical Sciences, Università degli Studi di Firenze, Sesto Fiorentino, 50019, Florence, Italy.', '3 Institute of Protein Biochemistry, CNR, Via Pietro Castellino 111, 80131, Naples, Italy.', '4 Institute of Biostructures and Bioimaging, CNR, via Mezzocannone, 16, 80134, Naples, Italy. gdesimon@unina.it.', '5 Institute of Biostructures and Bioimaging, CNR, via Mezzocannone, 16, 80134, Naples, Italy. marmonti@unina.it.']","Emma Langella, Martina Buonanno, Daniela Vullo, Nina Dathan, Marilisa Leone, Claudiu T Supuran, Giuseppina De Simone, Simona Maria Monti, ",Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,2018 Sep,Cancer; Hypoxia; Intrinsically disordered protein (IDP); Metalloenzyme; Natively unfolded; Polyproline II (PPII); Tumour.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29564477
1469,Magnetic control of heterogeneous ice nucleation with nanophase magnetite: Biophysical and agricultural implications,"In supercooled water, ice nucleation is a stochastic process that requires ∼250-300 molecules to transiently achieve structural ordering before an embryonic seed crystal can nucleate. This happens most easily on crystalline surfaces, in a process termed heterogeneous nucleation; without such surfaces, water droplets will supercool to below -30 °C before eventually freezing homogeneously. A variety of fundamental processes depends on heterogeneous ice nucleation, ranging from desert-blown dust inducing precipitation in clouds to frost resistance in plants. Recent experiments have shown that crystals of nanophase magnetite (Fe3O4) are powerful nucleation sites for this heterogeneous crystallization of ice, comparable to other materials like silver iodide and some cryobacterial peptides. In natural materials containing magnetite, its ferromagnetism offers the possibility that magneto-mechanical motion induced by external oscillating magnetic fields could act to disrupt the water-crystal interface, inhibiting the heterogeneous nucleation process in subfreezing water and promoting supercooling. For this to act, the magneto-mechanical rotation of the particles should be higher than the magnitude of Brownian motions. We report here that 10-Hz precessing magnetic fields, at strengths of 1 mT and above, on ∼50-nm magnetite crystals dispersed in ultrapure water, meet these criteria and do indeed produce highly significant supercooling. Using these rotating magnetic fields, we were able to elicit supercooling in two representative plant and animal tissues (celery and bovine muscle), both of which have detectable, natural levels of ferromagnetic material. Tailoring magnetic oscillations for the magnetite particle size distribution in different tissues could maximize this supercooling effect.","['1 Earth-Life Science Institute, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Meguro, 152-8550 Tokyo, Japan; kobayashi.a.an@m.titech.ac.jp.', '2 Department of Systems and Control Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Meguro, 152-8552 Tokyo, Japan.', '3 Earth-Life Science Institute, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Meguro, 152-8550 Tokyo, Japan.', '4 Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125.', '5 Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA 15213.']","Atsuko Kobayashi, Masamoto Horikawa, Joseph L Kirschvink, Harry N Golash, ",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2018,biogenic magnetite; food freezing; ice crystal nucleation; magnetic supercooling; nanoparticles.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29735681

1476,BacMam production and crystal structure of nonglycosylated apo human furin at 1.89 Å resolution,"Furin, also called proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 3 (PCSK3), is a calcium-dependent serine endoprotease that processes a wide variety of proproteins involved in cell function and homeostasis. Dysregulation of furin has been implicated in numerous disease states, including cancer and fibrosis. Mammalian cell expression of the furin ectodomain typically produces a highly glycosylated, heterogeneous protein, which can make crystallographic studies difficult. Here, the expression and purification of nonglycosylated human furin using the BacMam technology and site-directed mutagenesis of the glycosylation sites is reported. Nonglycosylated furin produced using this system retains full proteolytic activity indistinguishable from that of the glycosylated protein. Importantly, the nonglycosylated furin protein reliably forms extremely durable apo crystals that diffract to high resolution. These crystals can be soaked with a wide variety of inhibitors to enable a structure-guided drug-discovery campaign.","['1 Eshelman School of Pharmacy, Division of Chemical Biology and Medicinal Chemistry, Center for Integrative Chemical Biology and Drug Discovery, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 125 Mason Farm Road, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA.', '2 Platform Technology and Science, Department of Protein Cellular and Structural Sciences, GlaxoSmithKline, 1250 South Collegeville Road, Collegeville, PA 19426, USA.']","Kenneth H Pearce, Laurie K Overton, Robert T Gampe, George B Barrett, J David Taylor, David D McKee, Nino Campobasso, Robert T Nolte, Robert A Reid, ","Acta crystallographica.

1477,Dose compensation based on biological effectiveness due to interruption time for photon radiation therapy,"Objective:
      
    

    
      To evaluate the biological effectiveness of dose associated with interruption time; and propose the dose compensation method based on biological effectiveness when an interruption occurs during photon radiation therapy. Methods:
      
    

    
      The lineal energy distribution for human salivary gland tumor was calculated by Monte Carlo simulation using a photon beam. The biological dose (Dbio) was estimated using the microdosimetric kinetic model. The dose compensating factor with the physical dose for the difference of the Dbio with and without interruption (Δ) was derived. The interruption time (τ) was varied to 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 75, and 120 min. The dose per fraction and dose rate varied from 2 to 8 Gy and 0.1 to 24 Gy/min, respectively. Results:
      
    

    
      The maximum Δ with 1 Gy/min occurred when the interruption occurred at half the dose. The Δ with 1 Gy/min at half of the dose was over 3% for τ >= 20 min for 2 Gy, τ = 10 min for 5 Gy, and τ = 10 min for 8 Gy. The maximum difference of the Δ due to the dose rate was within 3% for 2 and 5 Gy, and achieving values of 4.0% for 8 Gy. The dose compensating factor was larger with a high dose per fraction and high-dose rate beams. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      A loss of biological effectiveness occurs due to interruption. Our proposal method could correct for the unexpected decrease of the biological effectiveness caused by interruption time. Advances in knowledge:

1478,Long-Term Activity Dynamics of Single Neurons and Networks,"The firing rate of neuronal spiking in vitro and in vivo significantly varies over extended timescales, characterized by long-memory processes and complex statistics, and appears in spontaneous as well as evoked activity upon repeated stimulus presentation. These variations in response features and their statistics, in face of repeated instances of a given physical input, are ubiquitous in all levels of brain-behavior organization. They are expressed in single neuron and network response variability but even appear in variations of subjective percepts or psychophysical choices and have been described as stemming from history-dependent, stochastic, or rate-determined processes.But what are the sources underlying these temporally rich variations in firing rate? Are they determined by interactions of the nervous system as a whole, or do isolated, single neurons or neuronal networks already express these fluctuations independent of higher levels? These questions motivated the application of a method that allows for controlled and specific long-term activation of a single neuron or neuronal network, isolated from higher levels of cortical organization.This chapter highlights the research done in cultured cortical networks to study (1) the inherent non-stationarity of neuronal network activity, (2) single neuron response fluctuations and underlying processes, and (3) the interface layer between network and single cell, the non-stationary efficacy of the ensemble of synapses impinging onto the observed neuron.","['1 Tactile Perception and Learning Lab, International School for Advanced Studies (SISSA), Trieste, Italy.

1479,Origin of biomolecular games: deception and molecular evolution,"Biological macromolecules encode information: some of it to endow the molecule with structural flexibility, some of it to enable molecular actions as a catalyst or a substrate, but a residual part can be used to communicate with other macromolecules. Thus, macromolecules do not need to possess information only to survive in an environment, but also to strategically interact with others by sending signals to a receiving macromolecule that can properly interpret the signal and act suitably. These sender-receiver signalling games are sustained by the information asymmetry that exists among the macromolecules. In both biochemistry and molecular evolution, the important role of information asymmetry remains largely unaddressed. Here, we provide a new unifying perspective on the impact of information symmetry between macromolecules on molecular evolutionary processes, while focusing on molecular deception. Biomolecular games arise from the ability of biological macromolecules to exert precise recognition, and their role as units of selection, meaning that they are subject to competition and cooperation with other macromolecules. Thus, signalling game theory can be used to better understand fundamental features of living systems such as molecular recognition, molecular mimicry, selfish elements and 'junk' DNA. We show how deceptive behaviour at the molecular level indicates a conflict of interest, and so provides evidence of genetic conflict. This model proposes that molecular deception is diagnostic of selfish behaviour, helping to explain the evasive behaviour of transposable elements in 'junk' DNA, for example. Additionally, in this broad review, a range of major evolutionary transitions are shown to be associated with the establishment of signalling conventions, many of which are susceptible to molecular deception. These perspectives allow us to assign rudimentary behaviour to macromolecules, and show how participation in signalling games differentiates biochemistry from abiotic chemistry.","['1 Department of Biology, University of Puerto Rico, San Juan, PR, USA stevenemassey@gmail.com.', '2 Courant Institute, New York University, NY, USA.']","Steven E Massey, Bud Mishra, ","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",2018 Sep,information asymmetry; molecular mimicry; signalling convention; signalling games.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30185543

1486,Effect of High-Induction Magnetic Stimulation on Elasticity of the Patellar Tendon,"Nowadays, a high-induction magnetic stimulation is starting to be increasingly applied as a biophysical stimulation in the conservative treatment of the degenerative locomotor system diseases. These are mainly in correlation with the changes in soft tissue elasticity, which should be positively influenced by the flow-induced electrical currents of high current density during high-induction magnetic stimulation. This assumption was verified within the interventional and prospective study using the ultrasound elastography. The group consisted of 6 volunteers, whose elasticity of the patellar tendons was measured using the 2D shear-wave ultrasound elastography. The volunteers were then exposed to a 20-minute high-induction magnetic stimulation session with a frequency of 20 Hz, in 2 s package intervals, with a 5 s pause, and a induced electric current density of 100 Am-2 in the tendons area. A tendon tension was measured five times for all volunteers, where mean tension at the marked area of the tendon, as well as the highest point tension indicated by the Q-Box, was monitored. The measurement results show that high-induction magnetic stimulation has an influence on the patellar tendon tension change, which occurred in the case of all involved volunteers when the patellar tension was decreased.","['1 Faculty of Biomedical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague, Sitna Sq. 3105, 272 01 Kladno, Czech Republic.', '2 Laboratory of Human Factors and Automation in Aviation, Czech Technical University in Prague, Horska 3, 128 03 Prague, Czech Republic.', '3 Soreha Ltd., Rehabilitation Clinic at Moldava nad Bodvou, Postupimska 27, 040 22 Kosice, Slovakia.']","Jaroslav Prucha, Vladimir Socha, Viera Sochova, Lenka Hanakova, Slobodan Stojic, ",Journal of healthcare engineering,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30154991

1488,Exploring Regulation of Protein O-Glycosylation in Isogenic Human HEK293 Cells by Differential O-Glycoproteomics,"Most proteins trafficking the secretory pathway of metazoan cells will acquire GalNAc-type O-glycosylation. GalNAc-type O-glycosylation is differentially regulated in cells by the expression of a repertoire of up to twenty genes encoding polypeptide GalNAc-transferase isoforms (GalNAc-Ts) that initiate O-glycosylation. These GalNAc-Ts orchestrate the positions and patterns of O-glycans on proteins in coordinated, but poorly understood ways - guided partly by the kinetic properties and substrate specificities of their catalytic domains, as well as by modulatory effects of their unique GalNAc-binding lectin domains. Here, we provide the hereto most comprehensive characterization of nonredundant contributions of individual GalNAc-T isoforms to the O-glycoproteome of the human HEK293 cell using quantitative differential O-glycoproteomics on a panel of isogenic HEK293 cells with knockout of GalNAc-T genes (GALNT1, T2, T3, T7, T10, or T11). We confirm that a major part of the O-glycoproteome is covered by redundancy, whereas distinct O-glycosite subsets are covered by nonredundant GalNAc-T isoform-specific functions. We demonstrate that the GalNAc-T7 and T10 isoforms function in follow-up of high-density O-glycosylated regions, and that GalNAc-T11 has highly restricted functions and essentially only serves the low-density lipoprotein-related receptors in linker regions (C6XXXTC1) between the ligand-binding repeats.","['1 From the ‡Copenhagen Center for Glycomics, Departments of Cellular and Molecular Medicine and Odontology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 3, DK-2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark yoshiki@sund.ku.dk.', '2 From the ‡Copenhagen Center for Glycomics, Departments of Cellular and Molecular Medicine and Odontology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 3, DK-2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark.', '3 From the ‡Copenhagen Center for Glycomics, Departments of Cellular and Molecular Medicine and Odontology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 3, DK-2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark seva@sund.ku.dk.']","Yoshiki Narimatsu, Hiren J Joshi, Katrine T Schjoldager, John Hintze, Adnan Halim, Catharina Steentoft, Rebecca Nason, Ulla Mandel, Eric P Bennett, Henrik Clausen, Sergey Y Vakhrushev, ",Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,2019 Jul,ETD; GALNT; Glycoproteomics; Glycosylation; Mass Spectrometry; Post-translational modifications*; Tandem Mass Spectrometry.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31040225
1489,A spike sorting toolbox for up to thousands of electrodes validated with ground truth recordings in vitro and in vivo,"In recent years, multielectrode arrays and large silicon probes have been developed to record simultaneously between hundreds and thousands of electrodes packed with a high density. However, they require novel methods to extract the spiking activity of large ensembles of neurons. Here, we developed a new toolbox to sort spikes from these large-scale extracellular data. To validate our method, we performed simultaneous extracellular and loose patch recordings in rodents to obtain 'ground truth' data, where the solution to this sorting problem is known for one cell. The performance of our algorithm was always close to the best expected performance, over a broad range of signal-to-noise ratios, in vitro and in vivo. The algorithm is entirely parallelized and has been successfully tested on recordings with up to 4225 electrodes. Our toolbox thus offers a generic solution to sort accurately spikes for up to thousands of electrodes.","['1 Institut de la Vision, INSERM UMRS 968, UPMC UM 80, Paris, France.', '2 Laboratoire de Physique Statistique, CNRS, ENS, UPMC, 75005, Paris, France.', '3 NMI, Neurophysics Group, Reutlingen, Germany.']","Pierre Yger, Giulia Lb Spampinato, Elric Esposito, Baptiste Lefebvre, Stéphane Deny, Christophe Gardella, Marcel Stimberg, Florian Jetter, Guenther Zeck, Serge Picaud, Jens Duebel, Olivier Marre, ",eLife,2018,electrophysiology; mouse; neural ensemble; neuroscience; population recording; rat; silicon probe; spike sorting.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29557782

1491,Chemical radiation dosimetry in magnetic fields: characterization of a Fricke-type chemical detector in 6 MV photon beams and magnetic fields up to 1.42 T,"In magnetic resonance guided radiotherapy (MRgRT) radiation dose measurements needs to be performed in the presence of a magnetic field. In this study, the influence of magnetic fields on the readings of a Fricke detector, a chemical dosimeter, have been investigated in 6 MV photon beams. This type of detector has been chosen, as the Federal Office of Metrology (METAS, Switzerland) has great experience with Fricke dosimetry and since it is not expected that this detector is greatly affected by the presence of a magnetic field. Magnetic fields with field strengths between 0 T and 1.42 T were applied during the detector irradiation. In a 5 × 10 cm2 irradiation field, the Fricke readings are affected less than 0.9% by the applied magnetic fields. Taking the altered dose distribution due to the magnetic field ([Formula: see text]) into account, the magnetic field correction factors ([Formula: see text]) for the Fricke detector at 0.35 T and 1.42 T are determined to be 0.9948 and 0.9980, respectively. These small corrections hardly exceed the measurement uncertainties. Hence, we could proof that the Fricke detector is not significantly influenced by the presence of a magnetic field. The Fricke detector was also tested for the feasibility of measuring output factors in the presence of magnetic fields. For irradiation field sizes larger than the detector (>2 × 2 cm2), comparable results were obtained as for other detectors. The output factors decrease when a magnetic field is applied. This effect is more pronounce for larger magnetic field strengths and smaller irradiation fields due to shifts of the depth dose curves and asymmetry of lateral dose profiles.","['1 Federal Office of Metrology METAS, Bern-Wabern, Switzerland.']","Maria A Trachsel, Stefan Pojtinger, Markus Meier, Markus Schrader, Ralf-Peter Kapsch, Christian Kottler, ",Physics in medicine and biology,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32028275

Large quantities of cytoplasm can be isolated, and biochemical manipulation of extract composition and cell cycle state is relatively straightforward. In this protocol, we describe the reconstitution of nuclear assembly by adding a chromatin source to interphasic X. laevis egg extract. Intact nuclei assemble within 30-45 min of initiating the reaction, followed by nuclear growth. We also describe methods for imaging and quantifying nuclear import kinetics. Recombinant proteins or small molecules of interest can be added to the extract before or after nuclear assembly, and immunodepletion allows for removal of specific proteins from the extract. This approach will continue to inform mechanisms of nuclear assembly, nuclear pore complex assembly and function, nucleocytoplasmic transport, DNA replication, nuclear envelope breakdown, and nuclear size and shape regulation.","['1 Department of Molecular Biology, University of Wyoming, Laramie, Wyoming 82071.', '2 Department of Molecular Biology, University of Wyoming, Laramie, Wyoming 82071 dlevy1@uwyo.edu.']","Pan Chen, Daniel L Levy, ",Cold Spring Harbor protocols,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29321282
1495,Tutorial: Correction of shifts in single-stage LC-MS(/MS) data,"Label-free LC-MS(/MS) provides accurate quantitative profiling of proteins and metabolites in complex biological samples such as cell lines, tissues and body fluids. A label-free experiment consists of several LC-MS(/MS) chromatograms that might be acquired over several days, across multiple laboratories using different instruments. Single-stage part (MS1 map) of the LC-MS(/MS) contains quantitative information on all compounds that can be detected by LC-MS(/MS) and is the data of choice used by quantitative LC-MS(/MS) data pre-processing workflows. Differences in experimental conditions and fluctuation of analytical parameters influence the overall quality of the MS1 maps and are factors hampering comparative statistical analyses and data interpretation. The quality of the obtained MS1 maps can be assessed based on changes in the two separation dimensions (retention time, mass-to-charge ratio) and the readout (ion intensity) of MS1 maps. In this tutorial we discuss two types of changes, monotonic and non-monotonic shifts, which may occur in the two separation dimensions and the readout of MS1 map. Monotonic shifts of MS1 maps can be corrected, while non-monotonic ones can only be assessed but not corrected, since correction would require precise modelling of the underlying physicochemical effects, which would require additional parameters and analysis. We discuss reasons for monotonic and non-monotonic shifts in the two separation dimensions and readout of MS1 maps, as well as algorithms that can be used to correct monotonic or to assess the extent non-monotonic shifts. Relation of non-monotonic shift with peak elution order inversion and orthogonality as defined in analytical chemistry is discussed. We aim this tutorial for data generator and evaluators scientists who aim to known the condition and approaches to produce and pre-processed comparable MS1 maps.","['1 Analytical Biochemistry, Department of Pharmacy, University of Groningen, A.

1498,Active photonic wireless power transfer into live tissues,"Recent advances in soft materials and mechanics activate development of many new types of electrical medical implants. Electronic implants that provide exceptional functions, however, usually require more electrical power, resulting in shorter period of usages although many approaches have been suggested to harvest electrical power in human bodies by resolving the issues related to power density, biocompatibility, tissue damage, and others. Here, we report an active photonic power transfer approach at the level of a full system to secure sustainable electrical power in human bodies. The active photonic power transfer system consists of a pair of the skin-attachable photon source patch and the photovoltaic device array integrated in a flexible medical implant. The skin-attachable patch actively emits photons that can penetrate through live tissues to be captured by the photovoltaic devices in a medical implant. The wireless power transfer system is very simple, e.g., active power transfer in direct current (DC) to DC without extra circuits, and can be used for implantable medical electronics regardless of weather, covering by clothes, in indoor or outdoor at day and night. We demonstrate feasibility of the approach by presenting thermal and mechanical compatibility with soft live tissues while generating enough electrical power in live bodies through in vivo animal experiments. We expect that the results enable long-term use of currently available implants in addition to accelerating emerging types of electrical implants that require higher power to provide diverse convenient diagnostic and therapeutic functions in human bodies.","['1 School of Mechanical Engineering, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST), 61005 Gwangju, Republic of Korea.', '2 Research Institute for Solar and Sustainable Energies, GIST, 61005 Gwangju, Republic of Korea.', '3 School of Mechanical Engineering, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST), 61005 Gwangju, Republic of Korea; jong@gist.ac.kr.']","Juho Kim, Jimin Seo, Dongwuk Jung, Taeyeon Lee, Hunpyo Ju, Junkyu Han, Namyun Kim, Jinmo Jeong, Sungbum Cho, Jae Hun Seol, Jongho Lee, ",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2020,bioelectronics; biomedical implants; flexible electronics; photonic power transfer.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32632002
1499,Numerical optimization of coordinated reset stimulation for desynchronizing neuronal network dynamics,"Excessive synchronization in neural activity is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD). A promising technique for treating PD is coordinated reset (CR) neuromodulation in which a neural population is desynchronized by the delivery of spatially-distributed current stimuli using multiple electrodes. In this study, we perform numerical optimization to find the energy-optimal current waveform for desynchronizing neuronal network with CR stimulation, by proposing and applying a new optimization method based on the direct search algorithm. In the proposed optimization method, the stimulating current is described as a Fourier series, and each Fourier coefficient as well as the stimulation period are directly optimized by evaluating the order parameter, which quantifies the synchrony level, from network simulation. This direct optimization scheme has an advantage that arbitrary changes in the dynamical properties of the network can be taken into account in the search process. By harnessing this advantage, we demonstrate the significant influence of externally applied oscillatory inputs and non-random network topology on the efficacy of CR modulation. Our results suggest that the effectiveness of brain stimulation for desynchronization may depend on various factors modulating the dynamics of the target network. We also discuss the possible relevance of the results to the efficacy of the stimulation in PD treatment.","['1 Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Yamagata University, 4-3-16 Jonan, Yonezawa, Yamagata, 992-8510, Japan. kubota@yz.yamagata-u.ac.jp.', '2 Department of Mathematics, University of Pittsburgh, 301 Thackeray Hall, Pittsburgh, PA, 15260, USA.']","Shigeru Kubota, Jonathan E Rubin, ",Journal of computational neuroscience,2018 Aug,Brain stimulation; Coordinated reset; Numerical optimization; Parkinson’s disease; Synchronization.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29882174

SCMS metabolomic data were analyzed using a comprehensive approach, including data pre-treatment, visualization, statistical analysis, machine learning, and pathway enrichment analysis. For comparative studies, traditional liquid chromatography-MS (LC-MS) experiments were conducted using lysates prepared from bulk cell samples. Metabolomic profiles of single cells were visualized through Partial Least Square-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), and the phenotypic biomarkers associated with emerging phenotypes induced by drug treatment were discovered and compared through a series of rigorous statistical analysis. Species of interest were further identified at both the single cell and population levels. In addition, four biological pathways potentially involved in the drug treatment were determined through pathway enrichment analysis. Our work demonstrated the capability of comprehensive pipeline studies of single cell metabolomics. This method can be potentially applied to broader types of SCMS datasets for future pharmaceutical and chemotherapeutic research.","['1 Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Oklahoma, 101 Stephenson Parkway, Norman, OK, 73019, USA.', '2 Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Oklahoma, 101 Stephenson Parkway, Norman, OK, 73019, USA.

The slowly accumulating body of experimental data is fueling renewed interest in and the need for computational methods to support interpretations and address a wide range of problems that are still not amenable to direct experimental study. The specific appeal of molecular dynamics simulations for this purpose lies in their ability to access information at atomic resolution, which is useful for the formulation of testable mechanistic hypotheses. But, the range of questions that can be addressed reliably with such simulations is determined by the appropriate construction and simulation of asymmetric bilayer models. One essential way to achieve this goal is to follow rigorous biophysical criteria and principles. In this context, we show that the requirement for a robust comparison between the properties of simulated asymmetric and symmetric model membranes is for the tension in each bilayer leaflet to be zero. Commonly used methods for constructing asymmetric bilayers, including matching the average areas of the leaflets from the corresponding symmetric systems, do not ensure zero leaflet tension, thus precluding physically realistic changes in the areas of the two leaflets. We present, to our knowledge, a new method for identifying the ideal lipid packing in bilayers with different leaflet compositions that achieves the zero-tension goal, and discuss the basic principles underlying the biophysically correct computational study of asymmetric membranes.","['1 Tri-Institutional PhD Program in Computational Biology and Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.

SR-SIM is usually a two-step process, with raw-data acquisition and subsequent, time-consuming post-processing for image reconstruction. In contrast, wide-field and (multi-spot) confocal techniques produce high-resolution images instantly. Such immediacy is also possible with SR-SIM, by tight integration of a video-rate capable SIM with fast reconstruction software. Here we present instant SR-SIM by VIGOR (Video-rate Immediate GPU-accelerated Open-Source Reconstruction). We demonstrate multi-color SR-SIM at video frame-rates, with less than 250 ms delay between measurement and reconstructed image display. This is achieved by modifying and extending high-speed SR-SIM image acquisition with a new, GPU-enhanced, network-enabled image-reconstruction software.

The size of EB-NS can be tailored to diameters <20 nm and heights down to 1 nm. EB-NS fluoresce at 910 nm and the fluorescence intensity correlates with the number of Cu2+ ions. Furthermore, EB-NS display no bleaching and high brightness compared with other NIR fluorophores. The versatility of EB-NS is demonstrated by in-vivo single-particle tracking and microrheology measurements in Drosophila melanogaster embryos. EB-NS can be uptaken by plants and remotely detected in a low-cost stand-off detection setup.

Simplicity, free solutions analysis, low sample volume, short analysis time, and immobilization free are the MST advantages over other competitive techniques.

1507,Comparison of underivatized silica and zwitterionic sulfobetaine hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography stationary phases for global metabolomics of human plasma,"To increase metabolome coverage in global LC-MS metabolomics, often both reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) and hydrophilic-interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) are implemented in parallel. However, there is a lack of consensus in the literature on the best HILIC stationary phase to employ for global metabolomics of human biological fluids. The objective of this study was to compare in detail the performance of two commonly employed HILIC phases: zwitterionic sulfobetaine ZIC-HILIC stationary phase and an underivatized silica HILIC stationary phase. During method development, the effect of salt concentration in the mobile phase was also investigated, and 5 mM ammonium acetate was selected. The stationary phases were evaluated using a mixture of 37 polar standards covering a range of logP values (-10 to 3.73), molecular weights (59-776 Da), charges (15 anions, 11 cations, and 11 neutral) as well as 17 lipid standards to understand phospholipid behaviour on the two stationary phases. The criteria used for the comparison included the quality of the chromatographic peak shape, adequate analyte retention, peak separation capability, and metabolite coverage. The zwitterionic ZIC-HILIC column provided better chromatographic performance over the silica stationary phase with 14 standards achieving good quality peaks compared to the 7 with the silica column. Only 2 standards were undetected with the ZIC-HILIC column compared to the 14 undetected with the silica column. In human plasma, 1966 and 1650 metabolites were observed on the ZIC-HILIC column in positive and negative electrospray ionization (ESI) respectively. On the silica HILIC column, 1773 and 2028 metabolites were observed in positive and negative ESI respectively, showing comparable performance of the two phases. Next, the effect of adding 10 mM ammonium phosphate to the samples to improve the analyte peak shape and metabolite coverage was investigated for both ZIC-HILIC and silica HILIC. In contrast with recently reported results for pZIC-HILIC, there was no clear evidence that ammonium phosphate addition was beneficial for human plasma samples. In conclusion, ZIC-HILIC provided better chromatographic performance for polar plasma metabolomics than underivatized silica in terms of chromatographic peak shape and chromatographic resolution, while maintaining comparable metabolite coverage. The addition of ammonium phosphate to human plasma was not beneficial for either of the two stationary phases.","['1 Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Concordia University, Montréal, Québec, Canada.', '2 Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Concordia University, Montréal, Québec, Canada.

      Despite data supporting the use of simulation training in procedural specialties and accreditation requirements, few options exist for electrophysiology (EP) training. We aimed to develop a low-cost, accessible simulator for training in EP mapping, and to test the simulator in a group of novice users. Methods:
      
    

    
      Our mapping simulator is composed of three components: an acrylic case representing torso and thigh; three-dimensional (3D) printed cardiac models; and a commercially available mapping system. Using a proprietary flexible material that mimics the consistency of human heart tissue, we created an anatomically accurate model of a normal right atrium (RA) from computed tomography data. We developed a test protocol consisting of two activities: creation of a RA shell and timed navigation to specific locations within the RA shell. Seventeen participants were randomized to either practice versus no practice on the simulator, and repeated simulator and self-assessment tests were performed after 1 week. We measured volume of the RA map and time taken and distance from the target sites for each target location. Results:
      
    

    
      Both groups showed improvement in generation of geometry, volume, time to target, and self-assessed comfort level after initial exposure to the simulator. Compared with no-practice, the practice group demonstrated an improved sense of confidence in mapping. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Focused training in EP mapping using a novel simulator created with 3D printed heart models and a standard mapping system is feasible for use in the training environment. Exposure to the simulator is associated with improved mapping skills and trainee comfort level.","[""1 Division of Pediatric Cardiology, Department of Pediatrics, Seattle Children's Hospital, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA."", '2 Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.']","Stephen P Seslar, Kristen K Patton, ",Pacing and clinical electrophysiology : PACE,2018 Feb,electrophysiology-clinical; mapping; simulation training.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29266257
1509,A patterned polystyrene-based microelectrode array for in vitro neuronal recordings,"Substrate-integrated microelectrode arrays (MEAs) are non-invasive platforms for recording supra-threshold signals, i.e. action potentials or spikes, from a variety of cultured electrically active cells, and are useful for pharmacological and toxicological studies. However, the MEA substrate, which is often fabricated using semiconductor processing technology, presents some challenges to the user. Specifically, the electrode encapsulation, which may consist of a variety of inorganic and organic materials, requires a specific substrate preparation protocol to optimize cell adhesion to the surface. Often, these protocols differ from and are more complex than traditional protocols for in vitro cell culture in polystyrene petri dishes. Here, we describe the fabrication of an MEA with indium tin oxide microelectrodes and a patterned polystyrene electrode encapsulation. We demonstrate the electrochemical stability of the electrodes and encapsulation, and show viable cell culture and in vitro recordings.","['1 Department of Chemistry, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, 75080, USA. ash107020@utdallas.edu.', '2 Department of Bioengineering, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, 75080, USA.', '3 Department of Materials Science & Engineering, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, 75080, USA.', '4 Department of Mechanical Engineering, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX, 75275, USA.']","Audrey Hammack, Rashed T Rihani, Bryan J Black, Joseph J Pancrazio, Bruce E Gnade, ",Biomedical microdevices,2018,Extracellular recording; Microelectrode array; Neuronal recording; Polystyrene; Primary neuronal cultures.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29909439
1510,Biophysical and physiological processes causing oxygen loss from coral reefs,"The microbialization of coral reefs predicts that microbial oxygen consumption will cause reef deoxygenation. Here we tested this hypothesis by analyzing reef microbial and primary producer oxygen metabolisms. Metagenomic data and in vitro incubations of bacteria with primary producer exudates showed that fleshy algae stimulate incomplete carbon oxidation metabolisms in heterotrophic bacteria. These metabolisms lead to increased cell sizes and abundances, resulting in bacteria consuming 10 times more oxygen than in coral incubations. Experiments probing the dissolved and gaseous oxygen with primary producers and bacteria together indicated the loss of oxygen through ebullition caused by heterogenous nucleation on algae surfaces. A model incorporating experimental production and loss rates predicted that microbes and ebullition can cause the loss of up to 67% of gross benthic oxygen production. This study indicates that microbial respiration and ebullition are increasingly relevant to reef deoxygenation as reefs become dominated by fleshy algae.","['1 Department of Biology, San Diego State University, San Diego, United States.', '2 Viral Information Institute, San Diego State University, San Diego, United States.', '3 Computational Science Research Center, San Diego State University, San Diego, United States.', '4 Department of Mathematics and Statistics, San Diego State University, San Diego, United States.', '5 Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology, University of Hawaii at Mānoa, Kāneohe, United States.', '6 Department of Microbiology, Rio de Janeiro Federal University, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', '7 Department of Physiology, Genetics and Microbiology, University of Alicante, Alicante, Spain.', '8 CARMABI Foundation, Willemstad, Curaçao.', '9 Department of Freshwater and Marine Ecology, Institute for Biodiversity andEcosystem Dynamics, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', '10 Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, Moss Landing, United States.', '11 NIOZ Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research, Utrecht University, Texel, Netherlands.']","Cynthia B Silveira, Antoni Luque, Ty Nf Roach, Helena Villela, Adam Barno, Kevin Green, Brandon Reyes, Esther Rubio-Portillo, Tram Le, Spencer Mead, Mark Hatay, Mark Ja Vermeij, Yuichiro Takeshita, Andreas Haas, Barbara Bailey, Forest Rohwer, ",eLife,2019,biomass; dissolved organic carbon; ecology; fleshy algae; microbialization; none; oxygen; respiration.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31793432
1511,Mechanomicrobiology: how bacteria sense and respond to forces,"Microorganisms have evolved to thrive in virtually any terrestrial and marine environment, exposing them to various mechanical cues mainly generated by fluid flow and pressure as well as surface contact. Cellular components enable bacteria to sense and respond to physical cues to optimize their function, ultimately improving bacterial fitness. Owing to newly developed biophysical techniques, we are now starting to appreciate the breadth of bacterial phenotypes influenced by mechanical inputs: adhesion, motility, biofilm formation and pathogenicity. In this Review, we discuss how microbiology and biophysics are converging to advance our understanding of the mechanobiology of microorganisms. We first review the various physical forces that bacteria experience in their natural environments and describe the structures that transmit these forces to a cell. We then discuss how forces can provide feedback to enhance adhesion and motility and how they can be transduced by dedicated cellular machinery to regulate diverse phenotypes. Finally, we provide a perspective on how mechanics influence biofilm spatial organization and homeostasis.","['1 Institute of Life Sciences, UCLouvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium.', '2 Walloon Excellence in Life Sciences and Biotechnology (WELBIO), Wavre, Belgium.', '3 Institute of Bioengineering and Global Health Institute, School of Life Sciences, Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland. alexandre.persat@epfl.ch.']","Yves F Dufrêne, Alexandre Persat, ",Nature reviews.

1513,Global and site-specific analysis of protein glycosylation in complex biological systems with Mass Spectrometry,"Protein glycosylation is ubiquitous in biological systems and plays essential roles in many cellular events. Global and site-specific analysis of glycoproteins in complex biological samples can advance our understanding of glycoprotein functions and cellular activities. However, it is extraordinarily challenging because of the low abundance of many glycoproteins and the heterogeneity of glycan structures. The emergence of mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics has provided us an excellent opportunity to comprehensively study proteins and their modifications, including glycosylation. In this review, we first summarize major methods for glycopeptide/glycoprotein enrichment, followed by the chemical and enzymatic methods to generate a mass tag for glycosylation site identification. We next discuss the systematic and quantitative analysis of glycoprotein dynamics. Reversible protein glycosylation is dynamic, and systematic study of glycoprotein dynamics helps us gain insight into glycoprotein functions. The last part of this review focuses on the applications of MS-based proteomics to study glycoproteins in different biological systems, including yeasts, plants, mice, human cells, and clinical samples. Intact glycopeptide analysis is also included in this section. Because of the importance of glycoproteins in complex biological systems, the field of glycoproteomics will continue to grow in the next decade. Innovative and effective MS-based methods will exponentially advance glycoscience, and enable us to identify glycoproteins as effective biomarkers for disease detection and drug targets for disease treatment. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

1514,Online Parallel Accumulation-Serial Fragmentation (PASEF) with a Novel Trapped Ion Mobility Mass Spectrometer,"In bottom-up proteomics, peptides are separated by liquid chromatography with elution peak widths in the range of seconds, whereas mass spectra are acquired in about 100 microseconds with time-of-flight (TOF) instruments. This allows adding ion mobility as a third dimension of separation. Among several formats, trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS) is attractive because of its small size, low voltage requirements and high efficiency of ion utilization. We have recently demonstrated a scan mode termed parallel accumulation - serial fragmentation (PASEF), which multiplies the sequencing speed without any loss in sensitivity (Meier et al., PMID: 26538118). Here we introduce the timsTOF Pro instrument, which optimally implements online PASEF. It features an orthogonal ion path into the ion mobility device, limiting the amount of debris entering the instrument and making it very robust in daily operation. We investigate different precursor selection schemes for shotgun proteomics to optimally allocate in excess of 100 fragmentation events per second. More than 600,000 fragmentation spectra in standard 120 min LC runs are achievable, which can be used for near exhaustive precursor selection in complex mixtures or accumulating the signal of weak precursors. In 120 min single runs of HeLa digest, MaxQuant identified more than 6,000 proteins without matching to a library and with high quantitative reproducibility (R > 0.97). Online PASEF achieves a remarkable sensitivity with more than 2,500 proteins identified in 30 min runs of only 10 ng HeLa digest. We also show that highly reproducible collisional cross sections can be acquired on a large scale (R > 0.99). PASEF on the timsTOF Pro is a valuable addition to the technological toolbox in proteomics, with a number of unique operating modes that are only beginning to be explored.","['1 From the ‡Proteomics and Signal Transduction, Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Am Klopferspitz 18, 82152 Martinsried, Germany.', '2 §Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Fahrenheitstr. 4, 28359 Bremen, Germany.', '3 ¶Bruker Daltonics Inc., Manning Road, Billerica, Massachusetts 01821.', '4 ‖Evosep Biosystems, Thriges Pl. 6, 5000 Odense, Denmark.', '5 **Computational Systems Biochemistry, Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Am Klopferspitz 18, 82152 Martinsried, Germany.', '6 From the ‡Proteomics and Signal Transduction, Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Am Klopferspitz 18, 82152 Martinsried, Germany; mmann@biochem.mpg.de.', '7 ‡‡NNF Center for Protein Research, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 3B, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.']","Florian Meier, Andreas-David Brunner, Scarlet Koch, Heiner Koch, Markus Lubeck, Michael Krause, Niels Goedecke, Jens Decker, Thomas Kosinski, Melvin A Park, Nicolai Bache, Ole Hoerning, Jürgen Cox, Oliver Räther, Matthias Mann, ",Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,2018 Dec,Collisional Cross Section; HPLC; Label-free quantification; Mass Spectrometry; PASEF; Protein Identification; Quantification; Sequencing MS; TIMS; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; ion mobility.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30385480
1515,A hypothesis study on bionic active noise reduction of auditory organs,"Background:
      
    

    
      Noise exposure can lead to hearing loss and multiple system dysfunctions. As various forms of noise exist in our living environments, and our auditory organs are very sensitive to acoustic stimuli, it is a challenge to protect our hearing system in certain noisy environments. Presentation of the hypothesis:
      
    

    
      Herein, we propose that our hearing organ could serve as a noise eliminator for high intensity noise and enhance acoustic signal processing abilities by increasing the signal-noise ratio. For suprathreshold signals, the hearing system is capable of regulating the middle ear muscles and other structures to actively suppress the sound level to a safe range. Testing the hypothesis:
      
    

    
      To test our hypothesis, both mathematic model analyses and animal model studies are needed. Based on a digital 3D reconstructed model, every structure in the auditory system can be analyzed and tested for its contribution to the process of noise reduction. Products manufactured by this bionic method could be used and verified in animal models and volunteers. Implications:
      
    

    
      By mimicking the noise-reduction effect of the sophisticated structures in the hearing system, we may be able to provide a model that establishes a new active-sound-suppression mode. This innovative method may overcome the limited capabilities of current noise protection options and become a promising possibility for noise prevention.","['1 Department of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, Institute of Otolaryngology, Chinese PLA General Hospital; Key Laboratory of Hearing Impairment Science, Ministry of Education; Beijing Key Laboratory of Hearing Impairment Prevention and Treatment, Beijing, 100853, China.', '2 Department of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, Institute of Otolaryngology, Chinese PLA General Hospital; Key Laboratory of Hearing Impairment Science, Ministry of Education; Beijing Key Laboratory of Hearing Impairment Prevention and Treatment, Beijing, 100853, China. yangsm301@263.net.']","Qing-Qing Jiang, Ning Yu, Shi-Ming Yang, ",Military Medical Research,2018,Active; Bionic; Hearing loss; Noise reduction.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29502534

1518,Visual features and perceptual context modulate attention towards evolutionarily relevant threatening stimuli: Electrophysiological evidence,"The snake detection hypothesis claims that predatory pressure from snakes has shaped the primate visual system, but we still know very little about how the brain processes evolutionarily important visual cues, and which factors are crucial for quick detection of snakes. We investigated how visual features modulate the electrophysiological markers of early attentional processes. In Experiment 1, we compared snake, rope, gun, and bird images to isolate the effects due to curvilinearity of the stimuli. The results showed that both snake and rope images elicited enhanced P1 and N1 event-related potential components as well as early posterior negativity (EPN). In Experiment 2, we studied whether nonthreatening curvilinear images (i.e., ropes) still elicit the enhanced electrophysiological responses when snake images are not presented as stimuli, and therefore the context does not provoke top-down attention to curvilinear shapes. Rope images still evoked an enhanced EPN, suggesting that curvilinear shapes are preferably captured by attentional processes. However, this effect was smaller than in Experiment 1, in which snake images were present. Thus, our results hint to the possibility that the perceptual context may interact with processing of shape information, drawing attention to curvilinear shapes when the presence of snakes is expectable. Furthermore, we observed that spatial frequency of the visual stimuli modulated especially the early electrophysiological responses, and decreased the differences between stimulus categories in EPN without completely eliminating them. The findings suggest that low-level and high-level mechanisms interact to give an attentional priority to potentially threatening stimuli.

1519,"Design, experiment and adsorption mechanism analysis of bionic sucker based on octopus sucker","The vacuum chuck is widely used in industrial and daily life. By observing the macroscopic and microscopic morphology of octopus sucker, it is found that the sucker surface has concave-convex continuous wave shape with large number of non-smooth morphologies. The sealing mechanism of octopus sucker is analyzed according to its surface morphology before and after adsorption, and the non-smooth morphology is found to greatly enhance the adsorption. Based on the bionics theory, the non-smooth surface morphology of octopus sucker is applied to improve the sucker adsorption. And the bionic suckers with three types of grooves are designed. According to the model of standard and bionic suckers, the sucker entities are obtained by the method of three-dimensional printing and casting. And the tensile tests of suckers are carried out. The stress of suckers is analyzed by finite element method, and the sealing mechanism is discussed. According to the test results, the bionic sucker has larger adsorption force. And the ring sucker possesses the best adsorption performance. Compared with the standard sucker, the maximum adsorption force of the bionic sucker is increased by 12.2% in the air and 25.2% underwater. The adsorption force of bionic sucker becomes larger with the increase in the groove number; when the groove number increases to a certain extent, the adsorption force becomes smaller. The deformation of non-smooth morphology during adsorption makes the bionic sucker have a larger contact area. That is the reason why the bionic sucker has good adsorption performance. The bionic design of sucker can provide a new method to improve its adsorption.","['1 Key Laboratory of Bionic Engineering, Ministry of Education, College of Biological and Agricultural Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun, P.R.

1520,A quasi three-dimensional visualization of unsteady wake flow in human undulatory swimming,"Human undulatory underwater swimming (UUS) is an underwater propelling technique in competitive swimming and its propulsive mechanism is poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to visualize the three-dimensional (3D) flow field in the wake region during human UUS in a water flume. A national level male swimmer performed 41 UUS trials in a water flume. A motion capture system and stereo particle image velocimetry (PIV) equipment were used to investigate the 3D coordinates of the swimmer and 3D flow fields in the wake region. After one kick cycle was divided into eight phases, we conducted coordinate transformations and phase averaging method to construct quasi 3D flow fields. At the end of the downward kick, the lower limbs external rotations of the lower limbs were observed, and the feet approached towards each other. A strong downstream flow, i.e. a jet was observed in the wake region during the downward kick, and the paired vortex structure was accompanied by a jet. In the vortex structure, a cluster of vortices and a jet were generated in the wake during the downward kick, and the vortices were subsequently shed from the feet by the rotated leg motion. This suggested that the swimmer gained a thrust by creating vortices around the foot during the downward kick, which collided to form a jet. This paper describes, illustrates, and explains the propulsive mechanism of human UUS.","['1 Faculty of Health Science, Department of Health and Sports, Niigata University of Health and Welfare, Japan; Institute for Human Movement and Medical Sciences, Niigata University of Health and Welfare, Japan.

1521,Markerless 2D kinematic analysis of underwater running: A deep learning approach,"Kinematic analysis is often performed with a camera system combined with reflective markers placed over bony landmarks. This method is restrictive (and often expensive), and limits the ability to perform analyses outside of the lab. In the present study, we used a markerless deep learning-based method to perform 2D kinematic analysis of deep water running, a task that poses several challenges to image processing methods. A single GoPro camera recorded sagittal plane lower limb motion. A deep neural network was trained using data from 17 individuals, and then used to predict the locations of markers that approximated joint centres. We found that 300-400 labelled images were sufficient to train the network to be able to position joint markers with an accuracy similar to that of a human labeler (mean difference < 3 pixels, around 1 cm). This level of accuracy is sufficient for many 2D applications, such as sports biomechanics, coaching/training, and rehabilitation. The method was sensitive enough to differentiate between closely-spaced running cadences (45-85 strides per minute in increments of 5). We also found high test-retest reliability of mean stride data, with between-session correlation coefficients of 0.90-0.97. Our approach represents a low-cost, adaptable solution for kinematic analysis, and could easily be modified for use in other movements and settings. Using additional cameras, this approach could also be used to perform 3D analyses. The method presented here may have broad applications in different fields, for example by enabling markerless motion analysis to be performed during rehabilitation, training or even competition environments.","['1 Faculty of Sport and Health Sciences, University of Jyväskylä, Finland.

      Recent advancements with induced pluripotent stem cell-derived (iPSC) retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) have made disease modeling and cell therapy for macular degeneration feasible. However, current techniques for intracellular electrophysiology - used to validate epithelial function - are painstaking and require manual skill; limiting experimental throughput. New method:
      
    

    
      A five-stage algorithm, leveraging advances in automated patch clamping, systematically derived and optimized, improves yield and reduces skill when compared to conventional, manual techniques. Results:
      
    

    
      The automated algorithm improves yield per attempt from 17% (manually, n = 23) to 22% (automated, n = 120) (chi-squared, p = 0.004). Specifically for RPE, depressing the local cell membrane by 6 μm and electroporating (buzzing) just prior to this depth (5 μm) maximized yield. Comparison with existing method:
      
    

    
      Conventionally, intracellular epithelial electrophysiology is performed by manually lowering a pipette with a micromanipulator, blindly, towards a monolayer of cells and spontaneously stopping when the magnitude of the instantaneous measured membrane potential decreased below a predetermined threshold. The new method automatically measures the pipette tip resistance during the descent, detects the cell surface, indents the cell membrane, and briefly buzzes to electroporate the membrane while descending, overall achieving a higher yield than conventional methods. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      This paper presents an algorithm for high-yield, automated intracellular electrophysiology in epithelia; optimized for human RPE. Automation reduces required user skill and training while, simultaneously, improving yield. This algorithm could enable large-scale exploration of drug toxicity and physiological function verification for numerous kinds of epithelia.","['1 Georgia Institute of Technology, G.W.

1523,An ultra-compact integrated system for brain activity recording and stimulation validated over cortical slow oscillations in vivo and in vitro,"The understanding of brain processing requires monitoring and exogenous modulation of neuronal ensembles. To this end, it is critical to implement equipment that ideally provides highly accurate, low latency recording and stimulation capabilities, that is functional for different experimental preparations and that is highly compact and mobile. To address these requirements, we designed a small ultra-flexible multielectrode array and combined it with an ultra-compact electronic system. The device consists of a polyimide microelectrode array (8 µm thick and with electrodes measuring as low as 10 µm in diameter) connected to a miniaturized electronic board capable of amplifying, filtering and digitalizing neural signals and, in addition, of stimulating brain tissue. To evaluate the system, we recorded slow oscillations generated in the cerebral cortex network both from in vitro slices and from in vivo anesthetized animals, and we modulated the oscillatory pattern by means of electrical and visual stimulation. Finally, we established a preliminary closed-loop algorithm in vitro that exploits the low latency of the electronics (<0.5 ms), thus allowing monitoring and modulating emergent cortical activity in real time to a desired target oscillatory frequency.","['1 Istituto per la Microelettronica e Microsistemi - Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Rome, Italy.', '2 Istituto per la Microelettronica e Microsistemi - Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Rome, Italy. davide.polese@cnr.it.', ""3 Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", '4 ICREA, Barcelona, Spain.']","Luca Pazzini, Davide Polese, Julia F Weinert, Luca Maiolo, Francesco Maita, Marco Marrani, Alessandro Pecora, Maria V Sanchez-Vives, Guglielmo Fortunato, ",Scientific reports,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30425252
1524,Assessing the biophysical and social drivers of burned area distribution at the local scale,"Understanding the characteristics of wildfire-affected communities and the importance of particular factors of different dimensions, is paramount to improve prevention and mitigation strategies, tailored to people's needs and abilities. In this study, we explored different combinations of biophysical and social factors to characterize wildfire-affected areas in Portugal. By means of machine-learning methods based on classification trees, we assessed the predictive ability of various models to discriminate different levels of wildfire incidence at the local scale. The model with the best performance included a reduced set of both biophysical and social variables and we found that, oveall, the exclusion of specific variables improved prediction rates of group classification. The most important variables were related to landcover; the civil parishes covered by more than 20% of shrublands were more fire-prone, whereas those parishes with at least 40% of agricultural land were less affected by wildfires. Regarding social variables, the most-affected parishes showed a lower proportion of foreign residents and lower purchasing power, conditions likely associated with the socioeconomic context of inland low-density rural areas, where rural abandonment, depopulation and ageing trends have been observed in the last decades. Further research is needed to investigate how other particular parameters representing the social context, and its evolution, can be integrated in wildfire occurrence modelling, and how these interact with the biophysical conditions over time.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Sandra Oliveira, José Luís Zêzere, ",Journal of environmental management,2020,Biophysical factors; Local communities; Portugal; Risk mitigation; Sociodemographic variables; Wildfire incidence.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32217324
1525,Single molecule secondary structure determination of proteins through infrared absorption nanospectroscopy,"The chemical and structural properties of biomolecules determine their interactions, and thus their functions, in a wide variety of biochemical processes. Innovative imaging methods have been developed to characterise biomolecular structures down to the angstrom level. However, acquiring vibrational absorption spectra at the single molecule level, a benchmark for bulk sample characterization, has remained elusive. Here, we introduce off-resonance, low power and short pulse infrared nanospectroscopy (ORS-nanoIR) to allow the acquisition of infrared absorption spectra and chemical maps at the single molecule level, at high throughput on a second timescale and with a high signal-to-noise ratio (~10-20). This high sensitivity enables the accurate determination of the secondary structure of single protein molecules with over a million-fold lower mass than conventional bulk vibrational spectroscopy. These results pave the way to probe directly the chemical and structural properties of individual biomolecules, as well as their interactions, in a broad range of chemical and biological systems.","['1 Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 1EW, UK. fsr26@cam.ac.uk.', '2 Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 1EW, UK.', '3 Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 1EW, UK. tpjk2@cam.ac.uk.', '4 Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB3 0HE, UK. tpjk2@cam.ac.uk.']","Francesco Simone Ruggeri, Benedetta Mannini, Roman Schmid, Michele Vendruscolo, Tuomas P J Knowles, ",Nature communications,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32522983
1526,Development of a 3D human osteoblast cell culture model for studying mechanobiology in orthodontics,"Objectives:
      
    

    
      Mechanobiology phenomena constitute a major element of the cellular and tissue response during orthodontic treatment and the implantation of a biomaterial. Better understanding these phenomena will improve the effectiveness of our treatments. The objective of this work is to validate a model of three-dimensional (3D) culture of osteoblasts to study mechanobiology. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      The hFOB 1.19 cell line was cultured either traditionally on a flat surface or in aggregates called spheroids. They were embedded in 0.8% low-melting agarose type VII and placed in a polyethylene terephthalate transwell insert. Compressive forces of 1 and 4 g/cm2 were applied with an adjustable weight. Proliferation was evaluated by measuring diameters, monitoring glucose levels, and conducting Hoechst/propidium iodide staining. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays focusing on the pro-inflammatory mediators interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 and bone remodelling factor osteoprotegerin were performed to evaluate soluble factor synthesis. quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed to evaluate bone marker transcription. Results:
      
    

    
      The 3D model shows good cell viability and permits IL dosing. Additionally, three gene expression profiles are analysable. Limitations:
      
    

    
      The model allows analysis of conventional markers; larger exploration is needed for better understanding osteoblast mechanobiology. However, it only allows an analysis over 3 days. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The results obtained by applying constant compressive forces to 3D osteoblastic cultures validate this model system for exploring biomolecule release and analysing gene transcription. In particular, it highlights a disturbance in the expression of markers of osteogenesis.","['1 Univ Rennes, CHU Rennes, Pole Odontologie, Rennes, France.', '2 ISCR, CNRS-UMR 6226, Rennes, France.']","Damien Brezulier, Pascal Pellen-Mussi, Sylvie Tricot-Doleux, Agnès Novella, Olivier Sorel, Sylvie Jeanne, ",European journal of orthodontics,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32144430

The analysis of blood metabolome can serve as effective means of diagnosis, implementation of which in healthcare is timely and relevant.

1529,Physical models can provide superior learning opportunities beyond the benefits of active engagements,"The essence of molecular biology education lies in understanding of gene expression, with subtopics including the central dogma processes, such as transcription and translation. While these concepts are core to the discipline, they are also notoriously difficult for students to learn, probably because they cannot be directly observed. While nearly all active learning strategies have been shown to improve learning compared with passive lectures, little has been done to compare different types of active learning. We hypothesized that physical models of central dogma processes would be especially helpful for learning, because they provide a resource that students can see, touch, and manipulate while trying to build their knowledge. For students enrolled in an entirely active-learning-based Cell & Molecular Biology course, we examined whether model-based activities were more effective than non-model based activities. To test their understanding at the beginning and end of the semester, we employed the multiple-select Central Dogma Concept Inventory (CDCI). Each student acted as their own control, as all students engaged in all lessons yet some questions related to model-based activities and some related to clicker questions, group problem-solving, and other non-model-based activities. While all students demonstrated learning gains on both types of question, they showed much higher learning gains on model-based questions. Examining their selected answers in detail showed that while higher performing students were prompted to refine their already-good mental models to be even better, lower performing students were able to construct new knowledge that was much more consistent with an expert's understanding. © 2018 The Authors.

1532,A biophysical model of striatal microcircuits suggests gamma and beta oscillations interleaved at delta/theta frequencies mediate periodicity in motor control,"Striatal oscillatory activity is associated with movement, reward, and decision-making, and observed in several interacting frequency bands. Local field potential recordings in rodent striatum show dopamine- and reward-dependent transitions between two states: a ""spontaneous"" state involving β (∼15-30 Hz) and low γ (∼40-60 Hz), and a state involving θ (∼4-8 Hz) and high γ (∼60-100 Hz) in response to dopaminergic agonism and reward. The mechanisms underlying these rhythmic dynamics, their interactions, and their functional consequences are not well understood. In this paper, we propose a biophysical model of striatal microcircuits that comprehensively describes the generation and interaction of these rhythms, as well as their modulation by dopamine. Building on previous modeling and experimental work suggesting that striatal projection neurons (SPNs) are capable of generating β oscillations, we show that networks of striatal fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) are capable of generating δ/θ (ie, 2 to 6 Hz) and γ rhythms. Under simulated low dopaminergic tone our model FSI network produces low γ band oscillations, while under high dopaminergic tone the FSI network produces high γ band activity nested within a δ/θ oscillation. SPN networks produce β rhythms in both conditions, but under high dopaminergic tone, this β oscillation is interrupted by δ/θ-periodic bursts of γ-frequency FSI inhibition. Thus, in the high dopamine state, packets of FSI γ and SPN β alternate at a δ/θ timescale. In addition to a mechanistic explanation for previously observed rhythmic interactions and transitions, our model suggests a hypothesis as to how the relationship between dopamine and rhythmicity impacts motor function. We hypothesize that high dopamine-induced periodic FSI γ-rhythmic inhibition enables switching between β-rhythmic SPN cell assemblies representing the currently active motor program, and thus that dopamine facilitates movement in part by allowing for rapid, periodic shifts in motor program execution.","['1 Graduate program in Neuroscience, Center for Systems Neuroscience, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.', '2 Department of Mathematics & Statistics, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.']","Julia A K Chartove, Michelle M McCarthy, Benjamin R Pittman-Polletta, Nancy J Kopell, ",PLoS computational biology,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32097404
1533,Dark matter in host-microbiome metabolomics: Tackling the unknowns-A review,"The ""dark matter"" in metabolomics (unknowns) represents an exciting frontier with significant potential for discovery in relation to biochemistry, yet it also presents one of the largest challenges to overcome. This focussed review takes a close look at the current state-of-the-art and future challenges in tackling the unknowns with specific focus on the human gut microbiome and host-microbe interactions. Metabolomics, like metabolism itself, is a very dynamic discipline, with many workflows and methods under development, both in terms of chemical analysis and post-analysis data processing. Here, we look at developments in the mutli-omic analyses and the use of mass spectrometry to investigate the exchange of metabolites between the host and the microbiome as well as the environment within the microbiome. A case study using HuMiX, a microfluidics-based human-microbial co-culture system that enables the co-culture of human and microbial cells under controlled conditions, is used to highlight opportunities and current limitations. Common definitions, approaches, databases and elucidation techniques from both the environmental and metabolomics fields are covered, with perspectives on how to merge these, as the boundaries blur between the fields. While reflecting on the number of unknowns remaining to be conquered in typical complex samples measured with mass spectrometry (often orders of magnitude above the ""knowns""), we provide an outlook on future perspectives and challenges in elucidating the relevant ""dark matter"".","['1 Environmental Cheminformatics Group, Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine (LCSB), University of Luxembourg, 7, Avenue des Hauts Fourneaux, L-4362 Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg; Eco-Systems Biology Group, LCSB, University of Luxembourg, 7, Avenue des Hauts Fourneaux, L-4362 Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg.

1542,The OpenPicoAmp-100k: an open-source high-performance amplifier for single channel recording in planar lipid bilayers,"We propose an upgraded version of our previously designed open-source lipid bilayer amplifier. This improved amplifier is now suitable both for the use in introductory courses in biophysics and neurosciences at the undergraduate level and for scientific research. Similar to its predecessor, the OpenPicoAmp-100k is designed using the common lithographic printed circuit board fabrication process and off-the-shelf electronic components. It consists of the high-speed headstage, followed by voltage-gain amplifier with built-in 6-order Bessel filter. The amplifier has a bandwidth of 100 kHz in the presence of 100-pF input membrane capacitance and is capable of measuring ion channel current with amplitudes from sub-pA and up to ± 4 nA. At the full bandwidth and with a 1 GΩ transimpedance gain, the amplifier shows 12 pArms noise with an open input and 112 pArms noise in the presence of 100-pF input capacitance, while at the 5-kHz bandwidth (typical in single-channel experiments), noise amounts to 0.45 pArms and 2.11 pArms, respectively. Using an optocoupler circuit producing TTL-controlled current impulses and using 50% threshold analysis, we show that at full bandwidth, the amplifier has deadtimes of 3.5 μs and 5 μs at signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of 9 and 1.7, respectively. Near 100% of true current impulses longer than 5 μs and 6.6 μs are detected at these two respective SNRs, while false event detection rate remains acceptably low. The wide bandwidth of the amplifier was confirmed in bilayer experiments with alamethicin, for which open ion channel current events shorter that 10 μs could be resolved.","['1 Laboratoire de Physiologie et Pharmacologie, Faculté de Médecine, Université libre de Bruxelles, Route de Lennik 808, CP604, 1070, Brussels, Belgium. vshlyons@ulb.ac.be.', ""2 Laboratoire d'Enseignement de la Physique, Faculté de Médecine, Université libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium. vshlyons@ulb.ac.be."", '3 Laboratoire de Physiologie et Pharmacologie, Faculté de Médecine, Université libre de Bruxelles, Route de Lennik 808, CP604, 1070, Brussels, Belgium.', ""4 Laboratoire d'Enseignement de la Physique, Faculté de Médecine, Université libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.""]","Vadim Shlyonsky, David Gall, ",Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology,2019 Dec,Electronic design; Ion channels; Temporal resolution; Voltage-clamp.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31655878

1544,Based serum metabolomics analysis reveals simultaneous interconnecting changes during chicken embryonic development,"Metabolic disorder is a major health problem and is associated with a number of metabolic diseases. Due to native hyperglycaemia and resistance to exogenous insulin, chickens as a model had used in the studies of adipose tissue biology, metabolism and obesity. But no detailed information is available about the comprehensive changes of serum metabolites at different stages of chicken embryonic development. This study employed LC/MS-QTOF to determine the changes of major functional metabolites at incubation day 14 (E14d), 19 (E19d) and hatching day 1 (H1d), and the associated pathways of differential metabolites during chicken embryonic development were analysed using Metabolite Set Enrichment Analysis method. Results showed that 39 metabolites were significantly changed from E14d to E19d and 68 metabolites were significantly altered from E19d to H1d in chicken embryos. Protein synthesis was promoted by increasing the concentrations of L-glutamine and threonine, and gonadal development was promoted through increasing oestrone content from E14d to E19d in chicken embryos, which indicated that serum glutamine, threonine and oestrone contents may be considered as the candidate indicators for assessment of early embryonic development. 2-oxoglutaric acid mainly contributed to enhancing the citric cycle, and it plays an important role in improving the growth of chicken embryos at the late development; the decreasing of L-glutamine, L-isoleucine and L-leucine contents from E19d to H1d in chicken embryonic development implied their possible functions as the feed additive during early posthatch period of broiler chickens to satisfy the growth. These results provided insights into understand the roles of serum metabolites at different developmental stages of chicken embryos, it also provides available information for chicken as a model to study metabolic disease or human obesity.","['1 Key Laboratory of Animal Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Veterinary Medicine, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.']","M L Peng, S N Li, Q Q He, J L Zhao, L L Li, H T Ma, ",Journal of animal physiology and animal nutrition,2018 Oct,LC/MS-QTOF; chicken embryos; development stage; metabolites.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29806083

1546,"How biomechanics, path planning and sensing enable gliding flight in a natural environment","Gliding animals traverse cluttered aerial environments when performing ecologically relevant behaviours. However, it is unknown how gliders execute collision-free flight over varying distances to reach their intended target. We quantified complete glide trajectories amid obstacles in a naturally behaving population of gliding lizards inhabiting a rainforest reserve. In this cluttered habitat, the lizards used glide paths with fewer obstacles than alternatives of similar distance. Their takeoff direction oriented them away from obstacles in their path and they subsequently made mid-air turns with accelerations of up to 0.5 g to reorient towards the target tree. These manoeuvres agreed well with a vision-based steering model which maximized their bearing angle with the obstacle while minimizing it with the target tree. Nonetheless, negotiating obstacles reduced mid-glide shallowing rates, implying greater loss of altitude. Finally, the lizards initiated a pitch-up landing manoeuvre consistent with a visual trigger model, suggesting that the landing decision was based on the optical size and speed of the target. They subsequently followed a controlled-collision approach towards the target, ending with variable impact speeds. Overall, the visually guided path planning strategy that enabled collision-free gliding required continuous changes in the gliding kinematics such that the lizards never attained theoretically ideal steady-state glide dynamics.","['1 Department of Biology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.']","Pranav C Khandelwal, Tyson L Hedrick, ",Proceedings.

1550,Mechanobiological model for simulation of injured cartilage degradation via pro-inflammatory cytokines and mechanical stimulus,"Post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) is associated with cartilage degradation, ultimately leading to disability and decrease of quality of life. Two key mechanisms have been suggested to occur in PTOA: tissue inflammation and abnormal biomechanical loading. Both mechanisms have been suggested to result in loss of cartilage proteoglycans, the source of tissue fixed charge density (FCD). In order to predict the simultaneous effect of these degrading mechanisms on FCD content, a computational model has been developed. We simulated spatial and temporal changes of FCD content in injured cartilage using a novel finite element model that incorporates (1) diffusion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 into tissue, and (2) the effect of excessive levels of shear strain near chondral defects during physiologically relevant loading. Cytokine-induced biochemical cartilage explant degradation occurs near the sides, top, and lesion, consistent with the literature. In turn, biomechanically-driven FCD loss is predicted near the lesion, in accordance with experimental findings: regions near lesions showed significantly more FCD depletion compared to regions away from lesions (p<0.01). Combined biochemical and biomechanical degradation is found near the free surfaces and especially near the lesion, and the corresponding bulk FCD loss agrees with experiments. We suggest that the presence of lesions plays a role in cytokine diffusion-driven degradation, and also predisposes cartilage for further biomechanical degradation. Models considering both these cartilage degradation pathways concomitantly are promising in silico tools for predicting disease progression, recognizing lesions at high risk, simulating treatments, and ultimately optimizing treatments to postpone the development of PTOA.","['1 Department of Applied Physics, University of Eastern Finland, Finland.', '2 Departments of Biological Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, United States of America.', '3 Department of Clinical Neurophysiology, Kuopio University Hospital, Finland.']","Atte S A Eskelinen, Petri Tanska, Cristina Florea, Gustavo A Orozco, Petro Julkunen, Alan J Grodzinsky, Rami K Korhonen, ",PLoS computational biology,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32584809

In this work, 3D printing was applied for the in-house production of customized components of a mechanical stretching bioreactor with potential application for cardiac tissue engineering and mechanobiology studies. The culture chamber housing and the motor housing were developed as functional permanent parts, aimed at fixing the culture chamber position and at guaranteeing motor watertightness, respectively. Innovative sample holder prototypes were specifically designed and 3D-printed for holding thin and soft biological samples during cyclic stretch culture. The manufactured components were tested in-house and in a cell biology laboratory. Moreover, tensile tests and finite element analysis were performed to investigate the gripping performance of the sample holder prototypes. All the components showed suitable performances in terms of design, ease of use, and functionality. Based on 3D printing, the bioreactor optimization was completely performed in-house, from design to fabrication, enabling customization freedom, strict design-to-prototype timing, and cost and time effective testing, finally boosting the bioreactor development process.","['1 PolitoBIOMed Lab, Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Politecnico di Torino, Turin 10129, Italy.', '2 Department of Public Health, University of Naples ""Federico II"", Naples, Italy.']","Giovanni Putame, Mara Terzini, Dario Carbonaro, Giuseppe Pisani, Gianpaolo Serino, Franca Di Meglio, Clotilde Castaldo, Diana Massai, ",Journal of healthcare engineering,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31178986
1552,Single molecule analysis reveals monomeric XPA bends DNA and undergoes episodic linear diffusion during damage search,"Nucleotide excision repair (NER) removes a wide range of DNA lesions, including UV-induced photoproducts and bulky base adducts. XPA is an essential protein in eukaryotic NER, although reports about its stoichiometry and role in damage recognition are controversial. Here, by PeakForce Tapping atomic force microscopy, we show that human XPA binds and bends DNA by ∼60° as a monomer. Furthermore, we observe XPA specificity for the helix-distorting base adduct N-(2'-deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-2-acetylaminofluorene over non-damaged dsDNA. Moreover, single molecule fluorescence microscopy reveals that DNA-bound XPA exhibits multiple modes of linear diffusion between paused phases. The presence of DNA damage increases the frequency of pausing. Truncated XPA, lacking the intrinsically disordered N- and C-termini, loses specificity for DNA lesions and shows less pausing on damaged DNA. Our data are consistent with a working model in which monomeric XPA bends DNA, displays episodic phases of linear diffusion along DNA, and pauses in response to DNA damage.","['1 Program in Molecular Biophysics and Structural Biology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, 15260, USA.', '2 UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, USA.', '3 Department of Pharmacology and Chemical Biology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, 15261, USA.', '4 Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, 15261, USA.', '5 Rudolf Virchow Center for Experimental Biomedicine, Institute for Structural Biology, University of Würzburg, 97080, Würzburg, Germany.', '6 Center for Integrated Protein Science at the Department of Chemistry, Ludwig Maximillian University of Munich, 81377, Munich, Germany.', '7 Center for Biologic Imaging, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, 15261, USA.', '8 UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, USA. vanhoutenb@upmc.edu.', '9 Department of Pharmacology and Chemical Biology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, 15261, USA. vanhoutenb@upmc.edu.']","Emily C Beckwitt, Sunbok Jang, Isadora Carnaval Detweiler, Jochen Kuper, Florian Sauer, Nina Simon, Johanna Bretzler, Simon C Watkins, Thomas Carell, Caroline Kisker, Bennett Van Houten, ",Nature communications,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32170071

Recently we designed the first completely symmetrical β-propeller protein, Pizza6, consisting of six identical tandem repeats. Pizza6 is expected to prove a useful building block for bionanotechnology, and also a tool to investigate the folding and evolution of β-propeller proteins. Folding studies are made difficult by the high stability and the lack of buried Trp residues to act as monitor fluorophores, so we have designed and characterized several Trp-containing Pizza6 derivatives. In total four proteins were designed, of which three could be purified and characterized. Crystal structures confirm these mutant proteins maintain the expected structure, and a clear redshift of Trp fluorescence emission could be observed upon denaturation. Among the derivative proteins, Pizza6-AYW appears to be the most suitable model protein for future folding/unfolding kinetics studies as it has a comparable stability as natural β-propeller proteins.","['1 Laboratory of Biomolecular Modelling and Design, Department of Chemistry, University of Leuven, Celestijnenlaan 200G-bus2403, Heverlee, Belgium.', '2 Laboratory of Biomolecular Architecture, Department of Chemistry, University of Leuven, Celestijnenlaan 200F-bus2404, Heverlee, Belgium.', '3 Drug Design Laboratory, Graduate School of Medical Life Science, Yokohama City University, 1-7-29 Suehiro, Yokohama, Kanagawa, 230-0045, Japan.', '4 Laboratory of Biomolecular Modelling and Design, Department of Chemistry, University of Leuven, Celestijnenlaan 200G-bus2403, Heverlee, Belgium.

1556,Perception of the tactile texture of raised-dot patterns: further evidence of an opponent process in the sense of touch,"Observers judged the tactile dissimilarities of raised-dot surfaces presented in pairs. The role of the SA I channel in determining these tactile dissimilarities was investigated by examining the dissimilarity judgments when this channel was adapted and when it was not. In an earlier study, the role of the PC channel in determining tactile dissimilarity was examined using the same stimulus materials when the PC channel was adapted and when it was not. Three orthogonal perceptual dimensions identified as blur, pattern roughness, and clarity were found using ALSCAL multidimensional analysis to account for the judged dissimilarities. The same three dimensions were found again in the present study. The dimensions of blur and pattern roughness were unaffected by adaptation of either the SA I or the PC channel. The finding of no effect of adaptation of the SA I channel on either of these two dimensions suggests that the roughness of the macrostructure of a textured surface is coded by the relative rather than by the absolute spatial variation in the firing rates of SA I nerve fibers. The dimension of dot clarity was strongly affected by adaptation of both the SA I channel and the PC channel. Adaptation of the PC channel increased dot clarity but adaptation of the SA I channel decreased it. This finding suggests that the perceived roughness of the microstructure of a textured surface is enhanced by the activity of the PC channel but decreased by the activity of the SA I channel.","['1 a Hamilton College , Clinton , New York , USA.']","George A Gescheider, John H Wright, ",Somatosensory & motor research,2018 Jun,Opponent process; selective adaptation; tactile channels; tactile texture perception.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29706104

1558,In vivo analysis for mechanism of drug action by juxtacellular recording,"Electrophysiological methods are commonly used in neuroscience and pharmacology to reveal the mechanisms of drug action. In vivo analysis of the mechanisms of drug action is a particularly important method in neuropharmacology. Here, we show the juxtacellular recording method to characterize the electrophysiological and neurochemical properties of neurons. Using juxtacellular recording, researchers can record the membrane potential from single neurons, and examine action potential parameters, such as the width and coefficient variance of inter-spike intervals. Additionally, recorded neurons can be labeled using neurobiotin, and neurochemical properties can be revealed by a combination of immunohistochemical staining and in situ hybridization. We introduce an experiment testing the effects of a phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor on the fronto-striatal circuit using juxtacellular recording. The cerebral cortex-nucleus accumbens (NAcc)-external segment of globus pallidus (GPe)-subthalamic nucleus (STN)-substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) pathway is the neurobiological basis of many neuropsychiatric disorders. Several components of this pathway are particularly important for the regulation of motor action and cognitive function: 1) STN-SNr pathway (hyperdirect pathway), 2) NAcc-SNr pathway (direct pathway), and 3) GPe-STN-SNr pathway (indirect pathway). Researchers can record tri-phasic responses reflecting these pathways using electro-stimulation in cerebral cortex. A PDE4 inhibitor, roflumilast, affected the 2) direct pathway as well as the 3) indirect pathway, but not the 1) hyperdirect pathway. The current findings suggest that PDE4 inhibition could be considered as a possible treatment for cognitive deficits related to fronto-striatal disorders such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and Parkinson's disease.","['1 Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Health Sciences University of Hokkaido.']","Hiroki Shikanai, Takeshi Izumi, ",Nihon yakurigaku zasshi.

1562,Energy optimization in gold nanoparticle enhanced radiation therapy,"Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) have been demonstrated as radiation dose enhancing agents. Kilovoltage external photon beams have been shown to yield the largest enhancement due to the high interaction probability with gold. While orthovoltage irradiations are feasible and promising, they suffer from a reduced tissue penetrating power. This study quantifies the effect of varying photon beam energies on various beam arrangements, body, tumor, and cellular GNP uptake geometries. Cell survival was modeled based on our previously developed GNP-local effect model with radial doses calculated using the TOPAS-nBio Monte Carlo code. Cell survival curves calculated for tumor sites with GNPs were used to calculate the relative biological effectiveness (RBE)-weighted dose. In order to evaluate the plan quality, the ratio of the mean dose between the tumor and normal tissue for 50-250 kVp beams with GNPs was compared to the standard of care using 6 MV photon beams without GNPs for breast and brain tumors. For breast using a single photon beam, kV + GNP was found to yield up to 2.73 times higher mean RBE-weighted dose to the tumor than two tangential megavoltage beams while delivering the same dose to healthy tissue. For irradiation of brain tumors using multiple photon beams, the GNP dose enhancement was found to be effective for energies above 50 keV. A small tumor at shallow depths was found to be the most effective treatment conditions for GNP enhanced radiation therapy. GNP uptake distributions in the cell (with or without nuclear uptake) and the beam arrangement were found to be important factors in determining the optimal photon beam energy.","['1 Department of Radiation Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States of America.']","Wonmo Sung, Jan Schuemann, ",Physics in medicine and biology,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29873303
1563,In search of sports biomechanics' holy grail: Can athlete-specific optimum sports techniques be identified?,"The development of methods that can identify athlete-specific optimum sports techniques-arguably the holy grail of sports biomechanics-is one of the greatest challenges for researchers in the field. This 'perspectives article' critically examines, from a dynamical systems theoretical standpoint, the claim that athlete-specific optimum sports techniques can be identified through biomechanical optimisation modelling. To identify athlete-specific optimum sports techniques, dynamical systems theory suggests that a representative set of organismic constraints, along with their non-linear characteristics, needs to be identified and incorporated into the mathematical model of the athlete. However, whether the athlete will be able to adopt, and reliably reproduce, his/her predicted optimum technique will largely be dependent on his/her intrinsic dynamics. If the attractor valley corresponding to the existing technique is deep, or if the attractor valleys corresponding to the existing technique and the predicted optimum technique are in different topographical regions of the dynamic landscape, technical modifications may be challenging or impossible to reliably implement even after extended practice. The attractor layout defining the intrinsic dynamics of the athlete, therefore, needs to be determined to establish the likelihood of the predicted optimum technique being reliably attainable by the athlete. Given the limited set of organismic constraints typically used in mathematical models of athletes, combined with the methodological challenges associated with mapping the attractor layout of an athlete, it seems unlikely that athlete-specific optimum sports techniques will be identifiable through biomechanical optimisation modelling for the majority of sports skills in the near future.","['1 National Sports Institute of Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur Sports City, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

To assess the effectiveness of a post-examination, one-on-one instructor remediation process on student performance in a pharmacy biochemistry course by measuring the degree of score improvement on a subsequent examination. Methods. Students who scored below 70% on any examination were encouraged to meet with the course coordinator. A typical remediation session lasts about 30 minutes, and covers academic preparation, study habits, concept understanding, application, critical thinking, time management, and stress control. Scores in two consecutive examinations were compared between students who underwent remediation and those who did not. All scores were adjusted for level of difficulty. Results. At-risk students with relatively lower scores are more likely to seek remediation. After receiving a score below 70%, students perform better on the next examination regardless of remediation. However, the remediation process results in a statistically significant 43% increase in the degree of improvement in student performance on the next examination. Conclusion. A post-examination, one-on-one remediation is effective in enhancing student performance in the biochemistry course. As this course is one of the two with the highest failure rates in the PharmD program, current intervention might improve student retention.","['1 McWhorter School of Pharmacy, Samford University, Birmingham, Alabama.']","X Robert Wang, Danielle L Cruthirds, Michael G Kendrach, ",American journal of pharmaceutical education,2018 Aug,biochemistry; early intervention; pharmacy; remediation; student retention.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30181668

Herein, we present a metabolite fingerprinting workflow, which is applicable for the analysis of tissues and fluids derived from plants and fungi. This is based on a broad metabolite coverage by a two-phase extraction and the separate analysis of polar, and nonpolar compounds by positive as well as negative electrospray ionization. For analysis of the resulting comprehensive data sets, the interactive and user-friendly data mining software MarVis-Suite is used. It supports statistical analysis, adduct correction, data merging, as well as visualization of multivariate data. Finally, MarVis shapes marker identification to the organism of interest. Therefore, it provides access to the species-specific databases KEGG and BioCyc and to custom databases tailored by the user.","['1 Department of Plant Biochemistry, Albrecht-von-Haller-Institute for Plant Sciences, University of Goettingen, Goettingen, Germany.', '2 Service Unit for Metabolomics and Lipidomics, Goettingen Center for Molecular Biosciences (GZMB), University of Goettingen, Goettingen, Germany.', '3 Department of Plant Biochemistry, Albrecht-von-Haller-Institute for Plant Sciences, University of Goettingen, Goettingen, Germany. ifeussn@uni-goettingen.de.', '4 Service Unit for Metabolomics and Lipidomics, Goettingen Center for Molecular Biosciences (GZMB), University of Goettingen, Goettingen, Germany. ifeussn@uni-goettingen.de.', '5 Department of Plant Biochemistry, Goettingen Center for Molecular Biosciences (GZMB), University of Goettingen, Goettingen, Germany. ifeussn@uni-goettingen.de.']","Kirstin Feussner, Ivo Feussner, ","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2019,Custom databases; Data mining; Fungus; Metabolite fingerprinting; Metabolome; Nontargeted metabolomics; Two-phase extraction.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31119663

1572,Keratoprosthesis Decentration and Tilt Results in Degradation in Image Quality,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      To study the effect of decentration and tilt of the type I Boston keratoprosthesis (KPro) on image quality in both aphakic and pseudophakic eyes. Methods:
      
    

    
      An optical ray-tracing program was used to simulate the image projected onto the retina in an eye with a perfectly centered KPro, and in eyes with varying degrees of KPro decentration and tilt. Decentration was modeled along a typical white-to-white distance of 12.0 mm, and the corresponding tilt was calculated assuming a radius of curvature of 8.0 mm, the radius of curvature of the backplate of the KPro. Both aphakic and pseudophakic eyes were simulated, and the corresponding modulation transfer function curves, point spread functions, and astigmatism were analyzed. Results:
      
    

    
      The perfectly centered KPro produced a high-quality image with no induced astigmatism. Increasing decentration beyond approximately 0.5 mm resulted in poorer image quality with a more pronounced effect in the presence of an intraocular lens. Using models of the normal eye as a threshold, image degradation due to decentration becomes clinically significant at approximately 1.4 mm and 0.9 mm for the aphakic and pseudophakic cases, respectively. Astigmatism introduced by decentration is approximately 0.25 D cylinders at those thresholds. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Decentration of up to 0.5 mm had no significant impact on image quality and an attempt at good intraoperative centration of the KPro within this range is important. Conversely, decentration of 0.9 mm or more during surgical implantation can result in significant degradation in retinal image quality including astigmatism. The effect is greater in the pseudophakic eye.","['1 University Hospitals Eye Institute, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, OH.', '2 Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH.', '3 Department of Biomedical Engineering, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH.']","Richard W Helms, Xiaowei Zhao, Rony R Sayegh, ",Cornea,2018 Jun,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29521688

While MS metabolite reference libraries have been generated for metabolomics applications, mass spectra alone are unable to unambiguously identify many metabolites in a sample; these unidentified compounds are typically annotated as ""features"". Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is an interesting technology for metabolite identification based on vibrational spectra. However, no reports have been published that present SERS metabolite spectra from chemical libraries. In this paper, we demonstrate that an untargeted approach utilizing citrate-capped silver nanoparticles yields SERS spectra for 20% of 80 compounds chosen randomly from a commercial metabolite library. Furthermore, prescreening of the metabolites according to chemical functionality allowed for the efficient identification of samples within the library that yield distinctive SERS spectra under our experimental conditions.

Using nonpupil-conjugated adaptive optics allows a wider field simulation compared to traditional pupil-conjugated adaptive optics. For a given contact lens, the mirror shape can be derived analytically using Fermat's principle of the stationary optical path or numerically using optimization in ray-tracing programs. An example of an aspheric contact lens simulation is given to illustrate the method, and the effect of eye misalignment with respect to the deformable mirror position is investigated. The optimal deformable mirror conjugation position is found to be near the posterior corneal surface. Chromatic aberration analysis is also presented, and our findings indicate that the polychromatic simulation quality is similar to that of the monochromatic case, even though the mirror is a reflective component.

1583,Causes and Biophysical Consequences of Cellulose Production by Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 at the Air-Liquid Interface,"Cellulose-overproducing wrinkly spreader mutants of Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 have been the focus of much investigation, but conditions promoting the production of cellulose in ancestral strain SBW25 and its effects and consequences have escaped in-depth investigation through lack of an in vitro phenotype. Here, using a custom-built device, we reveal that in static broth microcosms, ancestral SBW25 encounters environmental signals at the air-liquid interface that activate, via three diguanylate cyclase-encoding pathways (Wsp, Aws, and Mws), production of cellulose. Secretion of the polymer at the meniscus leads to modification of the environment and growth of numerous microcolonies that extend from the surface. Accumulation of cellulose and associated microbial growth leads to Rayleigh-Taylor instability resulting in bioconvection and rapid transport of water-soluble products over tens of millimeters. Drawing upon data, we built a mathematical model that recapitulates experimental results and captures the interactions between biological, chemical and physical processes.IMPORTANCE This work reveals a hitherto unrecognized behavior that manifests at the air-liquid interface that depends on production of cellulose and hints at undiscovered dimensions to bacterial life at surfaces. Additionally, the study links activation of known diguanylate cyclase-encoding pathways to cellulose expression and to signals encountered at the meniscus. Further significance stems from recognition of the consequences of fluid instabilities arising from surface production of cellulose for transport of water-soluble products over large distances.","[""1 Laboratoire de Génétique de l'Evolution, Ecole Supérieure de Physique et de Chimie Industrielles de la Ville de Paris (ESPCI), CNRS UMR 8231, PSL Research University, Paris, France maxime.ardre@espci.psl.eu rainey@evolbio.mpg.de."", ""2 Laboratoire de Génétique de l'Evolution, Ecole Supérieure de Physique et de Chimie Industrielles de la Ville de Paris (ESPCI), CNRS UMR 8231, PSL Research University, Paris, France."", '3 Department of Microbial Population Biology, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology, Plön, Germany.']","Maxime Ardré, Djinthana Dufour, Paul B Rainey, ",Journal of bacteriology,2019,continuum field models; microbial mats; pellicle; pyoverdin; spatial structure.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31085696

      This study is aimed at determining if tibial nerve stimulation (TNS) can modulate both bladder underactivity and overactivity. Methods:
      
    

    
      In α-chloralose anesthetized cats, tripolar cuff electrodes were implanted on both tibial nerves and TNS threshold (T) for inducing toe twitching was determined for each nerve. Normal bladder activity was elicited by slow intravesical infusion of saline; while bladder overactivity was induced by infusion of 0.25% acetic acid to irritate the bladder. Bladder underactivity was induced during saline infusion by repeated application (2-6 times) of 30-min TNS (5 Hz, 4-8T, 0.2 msec) to the left tibial nerve, while TNS (1 Hz, 4T, 0.2 msec) was applied to the right tibial nerve to reverse the bladder underactivity. Results:
      
    

    
      Prolonged 5-Hz TNS induced bladder underactivity by significantly increasing bladder capacity to 173.8% ± 10.4% of control and reducing the contraction amplitude to 40.1% ± 15.3% of control, while 1 Hz TNS normalized the contraction amplitude and significantly reduced the bladder capacity to 130%-140% of control. TNS at 1 Hz in normal bladders did not change contraction amplitude and only slightly changed the capacity, but in both normal and underactive bladders significantly increased contraction duration. The effects of 1 Hz TNS did not persist following stimulation. Under isovolumetric conditions when the bladder was underactive, TNS (0.5-3 Hz; 1-4T) induced large amplitude and sustained bladder contractions. In overactive bladders, TNS during cystometry inhibited bladder overactivity at 5 Hz but not at 1 Hz. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      This study indicates that TNS at different frequencies might be used to treat bladder underactivity and overactivity.","['1 Department of Urology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', '2 Department of Urology, China Rehabilitation Research Center, School of Rehabilitation Medicine, Capital Medical University, Beijing, P.R.

1586,Analytical Tools for Characterizing Cellulose-Active Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygenases (LPMOs),"Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases are copper-dependent enzymes that perform oxidative cleavage of glycosidic bonds in cellulose and various other polysaccharides. LPMOs acting on cellulose use a reactive oxygen species to abstract a hydrogen from the C1 or C4, followed by hydroxylation of the resulting substrate radical. The resulting hydroxylated species is unstable, resulting in glycoside bond scission and formation of an oxidized new chain end. These oxidized chain ends are spontaneously hydrated at neutral pH, leading to formation of an aldonic acid or a gemdiol, respectively. LPMO activity may be characterized using a variety of analytic tools, the most common of which are high-performance anion exchange chromatography system with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). NMR may be used to increase the certainty of product identifications, in particular the site of oxidation. Kinetic studies of LPMOs have several pitfalls and to avoid these, it is important to secure copper saturation, avoid the presence of free transition metals in solution, and control the amount of reductant (i.e., electron supply to the LPMO). Further insight into LPMO properties may be obtained by determining the redox potential and by determining the affinity for copper. In some cases, substrate affinity can be assessed using isothermal titration calorimetry. These methods are described in this chapter.","['1 Biotechnology and Food Science, Faculty of Chemistry, Norwegian University of Life Sciences, Ås, Norway.', '2 Department of Biotechnology and Food Science, NOBIPOL, NTNU Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway.', '3 Biotechnology and Food Science, Faculty of Chemistry, Norwegian University of Life Sciences, Ås, Norway.

      To characterize the proteome of 20 root canals in teeth with post-treatment endodontic disease using mass spectrometry and to correlate the identified proteins with clinical features. Methodology:
      
    

    
      Twenty patients with radiographic evidence of apical periodontitis and need for root canal re-treatment were selected. Samples from the root canal contents were collected and processed using two-dimensional capillary nano-flow liquid chromatography and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. The acquired spectra were separately searched against specific protein database. The results obtained were analysed using descriptive statistics. Additionally, Pearson's chi-square test or one-sided Fisher's exact test, as appropriate, was chosen to examine the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between each clinical feature and the presence of specific microbial or human proteins. Significance levels were set at 5% (P < 0.05). Results:
      
    

    
      A total of 1153 human and 720 microbial UniProt accession numbers corresponding to proteins were recovered. The greater prevalence of proteins was related to biological functions, such as cellular and metabolic processes. A considerable number of microbial proteins with clinical relevance functions, such as pathogenesis/virulence, proteolysis, cell adhesion and drug resistance, were detected. Common endodontic pathogens related to post-treatment endodontic disease such as Enterococcus spp., Propionibacterium spp. and Streptococcus spp. were associated with 23, 40 and 94 distinct proteins, respectively. As for human proteins, many factors related to the immune system process were detected. No significant correlations were found between microbial and human proteins and the clinical features investigated (P > 0.05). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      A considerable number of microbial and human proteins were identified using proteomic analyses, being mainly related to processes indicating cell viability. No significant correlation was found between proteins and clinical features.

1588,The Biophysical Basis for Phosphorylation-Enhanced DNA-Binding Autoinhibition of the ETS1 Transcription Factor,"The eukaryotic transcription factor ETS1 is regulated by an intrinsically disordered serine-rich region (SRR) that transiently associates with the adjacent ETS domain to inhibit DNA binding. In this study, we further elucidated the physicochemical basis for ETS1 autoinhibition by characterizing the interaction of its ETS domain with a series of synthetic peptides corresponding to the SRR. Binding is driven by the hydrophobic effect and enhanced electrostatically by phosphorylation of serines adjacent to aromatic residues in the amphipathic SRR. Structural characterization of the dynamic peptide/protein complex by NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography revealed multiple modes of binding that lead to autoinhibition by synergistically blocking the DNA-binding interface of the ETS domain and stabilizing an appended helical inhibitory module against allosterically induced unfolding. Consistent with these conclusions, the SRR peptide does not interact with DNA-bound ETS1. In addition, we found that the ETS1 SRR phosphopeptide binds to distantly related PU.1 in vitro, indicating that autoinhibition exploits features of the ETS domain that are conserved across this family of transcription factors.","['1 Genome Sciences and Technology Program, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada V6T 1Z3; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada V6T 1Z3.', '2 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada V6T 1Z3.', '3 Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada V6T 1Z3; Department of Chemistry, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada V6T 1Z1.', '4 Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada V6T 1Z3.', '5 Department of Oncological Sciences, School of Medicine, Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112-5550, USA; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Chevy Chase, MD 20815-6789, USA.', '6 Genome Sciences and Technology Program, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada V6T 1Z3; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada V6T 1Z3; Department of Chemistry, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada V6T 1Z1; Michael Smith Laboratories, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada V6T 1Z4.

Sample preparation procedures for the removal of interfering components or for pre-fractionation and preconcentration of proteins and peptides of interest are discussed. The innovations in coupling of capillary or microchip electroseparation methods with different modes of mass spectrometry detection are covered. In addition, significant recent applications of capillary electromigration methods in both bottom-up and top-down proteomics as well as in determinations of post-translational modifications of proteins are presented.

1590,Segmental innervation of the Göttingen minipig hind body. An electrophysiological study,"The Göttingen minipig is being used increasingly in biomedical research. The anatomical structure of the porcine peripheral nervous system has been extensively characterized, but no equivalent to the dermatome map, which is so valuable in human neurophysiological research, has been created. We characterized the medullar segmental skin and muscle innervations of the minipig hind body, using neurophysiological methodology. Six adult minipigs underwent unilateral laminectomy from L2 to S3, exposing the nerve roots. The skin of the hind part of the body was divided into 36 predefined fields, based on anatomical landmarks for consistent reproducibility. We recorded the evoked potential in each exposed nerve root L2-S3 for cutaneous stimulation of each skin field, mapping the sensory innervation of the entire hind body. We subsequently recorded the motor response in seven predefined muscles during sequential stimulation of the L2-S3 nerve roots. We obtained a clear sensory evoked potential in the nerve roots during stimulation of the skin fields, allowing us to map the sensory innervation of the minipig hind body. Neurophysiological data from skin stimulation and muscle recordings enabled us to map the sensory innervation of the Göttingen minipig hind body and provide information about muscular innervation. The skin fields were sensory innervated by more than one root. The muscles each had one dominant root with minor contribution from neighboring roots. This is consistent with experimental data from human studies.","['1 Department of Neurosurgery, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', '2 Department of Anesthesiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', '3 Department of Clinical Medicine, Center for Experimental Neuroscience (CENSE), Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.', '4 Department of Neurophysiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', '5 Department of Neurosurgery, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.', '6 PET Center, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.']","Kaare Meier, Erisela Qerama, Kåre Schmidt Ettrup, Andreas Nørgaard Glud, Aage Kristian Olsen Alstrup, Jens Christian Hedemann Sørensen, ",Journal of anatomy,2018 Oct,Sus scrofa; dermatome; minipig; neurophysiology; pig; segmental innervation; swine.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30040118
1591,A practical implementation of physics quality assurance for photon adaptive radiotherapy,"The fast evolution of technology in radiotherapy (RT) enabled the realization of adaptive radiotherapy (ART). However, the new characteristics of ART pose unique challenges for efficiencies and effectiveness of quality assurance (QA) strategies. In this paper, we discuss the necessary QAs for ART and introduce a practical implementation. A previously published work on failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) of ART is introduced first to explain the risks associated with ART sub-processes. After a brief discussion of QA challenges, we review the existing QA strategies and tools that might be suitable for each ART step. By introducing the MR-guided online ART QA processes developed at our institute, we demonstrate a practical implementation. The limitations and future works to develop more robust and efficient QA strategies are discussed at the end.","['1 Department of Radiation Oncology, Washington University, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.', '2 Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Abor, MI, 48109, USA.', '3 Department of Radiation Oncology, Washington University, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.

1592,Myocardial Monophasic Action Potential Recorded by Suction Electrode for Ionic Current Studies in Zebrafish,"The study of myocardial transmembrane ion currents is fundamental to understand frequent pathologies such as arrhythmias and ischemia. Conventional electrocardiography (ECG) is not able to record ion currents, while the use of intracellular microelectrodes in a beating heart has technical limitations. Myocardial monophasic action potentials (MAPs) recorded with suction electrodes allow the evaluation of ionic currents similar to those recorded by intracellular glass microelectrodes. The technique is based on the fact that suction, through a small diameter tube, on the myocardial cell, induces an opening at the membrane, connecting the intracellular media to the electrode by a saline bridge. The electrophysiology of zebrafish heart is remarkably similar to the human; however, in situ evaluation of MAPs has not been yet explored. In this study, we aimed to establish a myocardial MAP recording technique for adult zebrafish. Male adult wild-type zebrafish were anesthetized and 50% of the beating ventricle was exposed. A glass hematocrit capillary tube (1.1 mm inner diameter) was used as a suction electrode connected to a 3-way stopcock valve, which is also connected to a syringe containing a chloride-coated silver wire for signal recording. Gentle suction was exerted by a syringe filled with ringer and connected to the 3-way stopcock valve. Two needles were used for ground (tail) and indifferent (abdomen) electrodes. Without suction, the system can record conventional ECG, but applying suction MAPs are registered and show typical morphology with phase 0-4 sequence. MAP amplitude and duration values show low variability. Ischemia and/or lidocaine-induced Na+ channel blocking dramatically reduced MAP amplitude. These results strongly suggest that the suction electrode technique is a promising method to record myocardial ion currents in situ in zebrafish.","['1 Institute of Biological and Medical Engineering, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago, Chile.', '2 FONDAP Center for Genome Regulation, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile.', '3 Facultad de Medicina Veterinaria y Agronomía, Universidad de las Américas, Santiago, Chile.']","Miguel Miranda, José T Egaña, Miguel L Allende, Antonio Eblen-Zajjur, ",Zebrafish,2019 Oct,ECG; ischemia; lidocaine; monophasic action potentials; myocardial fibers; zebrafish.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31246560
1593,Single-molecule optical absorption imaging by nanomechanical photothermal sensing,"Absorption microscopy is a promising alternative to fluorescence microscopy for single-molecule imaging. So far, molecular absorption has been probed optically via the attenuation of a probing laser or via photothermal effects. The sensitivity of optical probing is not only restricted by background scattering but it is fundamentally limited by laser shot noise, which minimizes the achievable single-molecule signal-to-noise ratio. Here, we present nanomechanical photothermal microscopy, which overcomes the scattering and shot-noise limit by detecting the photothermal heating of the sample directly with a temperature-sensitive substrate. We use nanomechanical silicon nitride drums, whose resonant frequency detunes with local heating. Individual Au nanoparticles with diameters from 10 to 200 nm and single molecules (Atto 633) are scanned with a heating laser with a peak irradiance of 354 ± 45 µW/µm2 using 50× long-working-distance objective. With a stress-optimized drum we reach a sensitivity of 16 fW/Hz1/2 at room temperature, resulting in a single-molecule signal-to-noise ratio of >70. The high sensitivity combined with the inherent wavelength independence of the nanomechanical sensor presents a competitive alternative to established tools for the analysis and localization of nonfluorescent single molecules and nanoparticles.","['1 Institute of Sensor and Actuator Systems, TU Wien, 1040 Vienna, Austria.', '2 Institute of Applied Physics, TU Wien, 1040 Vienna, Austria.', '3 Institute of Sensor and Actuator Systems, TU Wien, 1040 Vienna, Austria; silvan.schmid@tuwien.ac.at.']","Miao-Hsuan Chien, Mario Brameshuber, Benedikt K Rossboth, Gerhard J Schütz, Silvan Schmid, ",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2018,nanoelectromechanical systems; nanomechanical sensing; nanoparticle absorption analysis; photothermal microscopy; single-molecule imaging.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30254155
1594,Efficient strategy for introducing large and multiple changes in plasmid DNA,"While the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method and its later modifications are extremely useful and simple, they suffer from several drawbacks. Here, we propose a new method, named LFEAP mutagenesis (Ligation of Fragment Ends After PCR) for creating various mutations in plasmid by leveraging three existing concepts: inverse PCR, single primer PCR, and sticky-end assembly. The first inverse PCR on the target plasmid yielded linearized DNA fragments with mutagenic ends, and a second single primer PCR resulted in complementary single-stranded DNA fragments with the addition of overhangs at the 5' end of each strand. The resulting single strands were then annealed to produce double-stranded DNA with free 5' single-stranded DNA tails. These products with compatible sticky ends were efficiently assembled into a circular, mutagenized plasmid. With this strategy, multiple simultaneous changes (up to 15) and mutations in large plasmids (up to 50 kb) were achieved with high efficiency and fidelity. LFEAP mutagenesis is a versatile method that offers significant advantages for introducing large and multiple changes in plasmid DNA.","['1 College of Life Sciences, Hebei Agricultural University, Baoding, 071001, China.', '2 Institute of Biophysics, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, 300401, China.', '3 College of Life Sciences, Hebei Agricultural University, Baoding, 071001, China. shmdjg@hebau.edu.cn.', '4 Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston McGovern Medical School, 6431 Fannin Street, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.

1595,Optical and thermal modeling of an optrode microdevice for infrared neural stimulation,"Infrared neural stimulation is a promising medical technique using pulsed infrared light for generating temperature-controlled firing of neurons. A combined optical and thermal model of a stimulating microtool-or so-called optrode-has been developed to investigate the amount, the spatial distribution, and the temporal behavior of the thermal excitation. Ray tracing and Fourier optics were used to describe the propagation and scattering of light in the optrode, and the finite element method was applied to model heat transfer. The scattered intensity distribution profiles were calculated based on measured surface roughness of the device and were integrated into the ray optics model. As a validation of the optical model, the simulated and measured values of the light efficiency of the microoptical system are compared. The temperature rise of the brain tissue during the infrared stimulation was estimated using the combined model. Using 30 mW total power and a single 100 ms pulse, the excitation resulted in a temperature rise of 3°C of the brain tissue. The spatial and temporal distributions of the tissue temperature are discussed in the paper.

1596,Synthetic Oligosaccharide Libraries and Microarray Technology: A Powerful Combination for the Success of Current Glycosaminoglycan Interactomics,"Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are extracellular matrix and/or cell-surface sulfated glycans crucial to the regulation of various signaling proteins, the functions of which are essential in many pathophysiological systems. Because structural heterogeneity is high in GAG chains and purification is difficult, the use of structurally defined GAG oligosaccharides from natural sources as molecular models in both biophysical and pharmacological assays is limited. To overcome this obstacle, GAG-like oligosaccharides of well-defined structures are currently being synthesized by chemical and/or enzymatic means in many research groups around the world. These synthetic GAG oligosaccharides serve as useful molecular tools in studies of GAG-protein interactions. In this review, besides discussing the commonest routes used for the synthesis of GAG oligosaccharides, we also survey some libraries of these synthetic models currently available for research and discuss their activities in interaction studies with functional proteins, especially through the microarray approach.","['1 Program of Glycobiology, Institute of Medical Biochemistry Leopoldo de Meis and University Hospital Clementino Fraga Filho, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, 21941-913, Brazil.', '2 School of Molecular Sciences, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, 85287, USA.']","Vitor H Pomin, Xu Wang, ",ChemMedChem,2018,de novo synthesis; enzymatic synthesis; glycosaminoglycans; interactome; microarrays; oligosaccharides.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29160016

1598,mzTab-M: A Data Standard for Sharing Quantitative Results in Mass Spectrometry Metabolomics,"Mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the primary techniques used for large-scale analysis of small molecules in metabolomics studies. To date, there has been little data format standardization in this field, as different software packages export results in different formats represented in XML or plain text, making data sharing, database deposition, and reanalysis highly challenging. Working within the consortia of the Metabolomics Standards Initiative, Proteomics Standards Initiative, and the Metabolomics Society, we have created mzTab-M to act as a common output format from analytical approaches using MS on small molecules. The format has been developed over several years, with input from a wide range of stakeholders. mzTab-M is a simple tab-separated text format, but importantly, the structure is highly standardized through the design of a detailed specification document, tightly coupled to validation software, and a mandatory controlled vocabulary of terms to populate it. The format is able to represent final quantification values from analyses, as well as the evidence trail in terms of features measured directly from MS (e.g., LC-MS, GC-MS, DIMS, etc.) and different types of approaches used to identify molecules. mzTab-M allows for ambiguity in the identification of molecules to be communicated clearly to readers of the files (both people and software). There are several implementations of the format available, and we anticipate widespread adoption in the field.","['1 Leibniz-Institut für Analytische Wissenschaften-ISAS-e.V. , Otto-Hahn-Straße 6b , 44227 Dortmund , Germany.', '2 Wellcome Sanger Institute , Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge CB10 1SA , United Kingdom.', '3 Applied Bioinformatics Group, Center for Bioinformatics , University of Tübingen , Sand 14 , 72076 Tübingen , Germany.', '4 Institute of Computational Biotechnology , Graz University of Technology , Petersgasse 14 , 8010 Graz , Austria.', '5 Center for Explorative Lipidomics , BioTechMed-Graz , 8010 Graz , Austria.', '6 European Molecular Biology Laboratory , European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) , Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge CB10 1SD , United Kingdom.', '7 Medizinisches Proteom Center (MPC) , Ruhr-Universität Bochum , Universitätsstraße 150 , D-44801 Bochum , Germany.', '8 Metabolomics Australia , The University of Melbourne , Parkville , Victoria 3010 , Australia.', '9 MRC-NIHR National Phenome Centre, Department of Surgery & Cancer , Imperial College London , London SW7 2AZ , United Kingdom.', '10 University of Oxford , e-Research Centre , 7 Keble Road , Oxford OX1 3QG , United Kingdom.', ""11 BGI-Shenzhen , Shenzhen , 518083 , People's Republic of China."", '12 Institute of Integrative Biology, University of Liverpool , Liverpool L69 7ZB , United Kingdom.', '13 International Agency for Research on Cancer , 150 cours Albert Thomas , 69008 Lyon , France.', '14 Department of Stress and Developmental Biology , Leibniz Institute of Plant Biochemistry , 06120 Halle , Germany.', '15 German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) , Halle-Jena-Leipzig Deutscher, Platz 5e , 04103 Leipzig , Germany.']","Nils Hoffmann, Joel Rein, Timo Sachsenberg, Jürgen Hartler, Kenneth Haug, Gerhard Mayer, Oliver Alka, Saravanan Dayalan, Jake T M Pearce, Philippe Rocca-Serra, Da Qi, Martin Eisenacher, Yasset Perez-Riverol, Juan Antonio Vizcaíno, Reza M Salek, Steffen Neumann, Andrew R Jones, ",Analytical chemistry,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30688441

However, the function of VTA GABAergic (Vgat+) neurons remains poorly understood. Here, using three-dimensional motion capture, in vivo electrophysiology, calcium imaging, and optogenetics, we demonstrate a novel function of VTAVgat+ neurons. We found three distinct populations of neurons, each representing head angle about a principal axis of rotation: yaw, roll, and pitch. For each axis, opponent cell groups were found that increase firing when the head moves in one direction and decrease firing in the opposite direction. Selective excitation and inhibition of VTAVgat+ neurons generate opposite rotational movements. Thus, VTAVgat+ neurons serve a critical role in the control of rotational kinematics while pursuing a moving target. This general-purpose steering function can guide animals toward desired spatial targets in any motivated behavior.","['1 Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, Duke University, Durham, NC 27708, USA.', '2 Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, Duke University, Durham, NC 27708, USA; Department of Neurobiology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC 27708, USA.

However, current methods coupling mass spectrometry with chromatography are time-consuming and not suitable for high-throughput analysis of thousands of samples. An alternative approach is flow-injection mass spectrometry (FI-MS) in which samples are directly injected to the ionization source. Here, we show that the sensitivity of Orbitrap FI-MS metabolomics methods is limited by ion competition effect. We describe an approach for overcoming this effect by analyzing the distribution of ion m/z values and computationally determining a series of optimal scan ranges. This enables reproducible detection of ~9,000 and ~10,000 m/z features in metabolomics and lipidomics analysis of serum samples, respectively, with a sample scan time of ~15 s and duty time of ~30 s; a ~50% increase versus current spectral-stitching FI-MS.

1603,Spirally deformable soft actuators and their designable helical actuations based on a highly oriented carbon nanotube film,"Spiral configurations and helical curlings of plant tendrils and seed pods are very common in nature. Many researchers have tried to develop spirally deformable actuators to mimic these natural spirals through several approaches, such as preforming helical shapes, processing diagonal stripes and employing anisotropic organic layers. However, these methods are usually complex and time-consuming. Here, we used an efficient method to produce a highly oriented carbon nanotube (CNT) film and develop a series of spirally deformable soft actuators which perform various controllable helical actuations. The actuator consists of a CNT layer with strong anisotropy and a silicone layer. By simply adjusting the orientations of the aligned CNTs, the prepared actuators can accomplish left- or right-handed spiral deformations with different helical forms when driven by electricity. Finite element analyses and simulations were conducted to investigate the mechanism. It is confirmed that it is the anisotropic moduli of the CNT film that regulate the internal stress distributions of the actuators and lead to helical actuations. Moreover, complex actuator designs and functional applications were also carried out. A V-shaped actuator can simultaneously achieve left- and right-handed curling with large angles (630°), which vividly imitates the spiral winding of a tendril. A Y-shaped actuator performed three-dimensional movements, which can manipulate lightweight objects deftly. By virtue of easy preparation and flexible function design, the spirally deformable actuators based on the oriented CNT film will be very promising in artificial muscles and bionic soft robots.","['1 Intelligent Robotics Institute, School of Mechatronical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing 100081, China. liqw@bit.edu.cn.']","Qingwei Li, Xingbei Wang, Lixin Dong, Changhong Liu, Shoushan Fan, ",Soft matter,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31746933

Processing of temporal aspects of auditory input is understudied; yet, deficits in this domain could contribute to language-related impairments. In children with ASD and well-matched controls, this study examined electrophysiological response to silent gaps in auditory stimuli. Results revealed attenuated amplitude of the P2 event-related potential (ERP) component in ASD. The P2 amplitude reduction was also associated with sensory, language, and diagnostic features.

1605,Differences in the impedance of cochlear implant devices within 24 hours of their implantation,"Cochlear implantation is a surgical procedure, which is performed on severely hearing-impaired patients. Impedance field telemetry is commonly used to determine the integrity of the cochlear implant device during and after surgery. At the Department of Otolaryngology, Cheng Hsin General Hospital (Taipei, Taiwan), the cochlear implant devices are switched on within 24 hours of their implantation. In the present study, the impedance changes of Advanced Bionics™ cochlear implant devices were compared with previous studies and other devices. The aim was to confirm previous hypotheses and to explore other potential associated factors that could influence impedance following cochlear implantation. The current study included 12 patients who underwent cochlear implantation at Cheng Hsin General Hospital with Advanced Bionics cochlear implant devices. The cochlear devices were all switched on within 24 hours of their implantation. The impedance was measured and compared across all contact channels of the electrode, both intra-operatively and post-operatively. The intra-operative impedance was compared with the switch-on impedance (within 24 hours of the cochlear implantation); the impedance was notably increased for all contact channels at switch-on. Of the 16 channels examined, 4 channels had a significant increase in impedance between the intra-operative measurement and the switch-on measurement. To the best of our knowledge, the impedance of a cochlear implant device can be affected by the diameter of the electrode, the position of the electrode arrays in the scala tympani, sheath formation and fibrosis surrounding the electrode after implantation and electrical stimulation during or after surgery.

1607,Metabolomics in Plant Priming Research: The Way Forward?,"A new era of plant biochemistry at the systems level is emerging, providing detailed descriptions of biochemical phenomena at the cellular and organismal level. This new era is marked by the advent of metabolomics—the qualitative and quantitative investigation of the entire metabolome (in a dynamic equilibrium) of a biological system. This field has developed as an indispensable methodological approach to study cellular biochemistry at a global level. For protection and survival in a constantly-changing environment, plants rely on a complex and multi-layered innate immune system. This involves surveillance of ‘self’ and ‘non-self,’ molecule-based systemic signalling and metabolic adaptations involving primary and secondary metabolites as well as epigenetic modulation mechanisms. Establishment of a pre-conditioned or primed state can sensitise or enhance aspects of innate immunity for faster and stronger responses. Comprehensive elucidation of the molecular and biochemical processes associated with the phenotypic defence state is vital for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that define the metabolism of plant⁻pathogen interactions. Such insights are essential for translational research and applications. Thus, this review highlights the prospects of metabolomics and addresses current challenges that hinder the realisation of the full potential of the field. Such limitations include partial coverage of the metabolome and maximising the value of metabolomics data (extraction of information and interpretation). Furthermore, the review points out key features that characterise both the plant innate immune system and enhancement of the latter, thus underlining insights from metabolomic studies in plant priming. Future perspectives in this inspiring area are included, with the aim of stimulating further studies leading to a better understanding of plant immunity at the metabolome level.","['1 Department of Biochemistry, Research Centre for Plant Metabolomics, University of Johannesburg, Auckland Park 2006, South Africa.

1608,Biophysically motivated efficient estimation of the spatially isotropic [Formula: see text] component from a single gradient-recalled echo measurement,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      To propose and validate an efficient method, based on a biophysically motivated signal model, for removing the orientation-dependent part of R 2 *  using a single gradient-recalled echo (GRE) measurement. Methods:
      
    

    
      The proposed method utilized a temporal second-order approximation of the hollow-cylinder-fiber model, in which the parameter describing the linear signal decay corresponded to the orientation-independent part of R 2 *  . The estimated parameters were compared to the classical, mono-exponential decay model for R 2 *  in a sample of an ex vivo human optic chiasm (OC). The OC was measured at 16 distinct orientations relative to the external magnetic field using GRE at 7T. To show that the proposed signal model can remove the orientation dependence of R 2 *  , it was compared to the established phenomenological method for separating R 2 *  into orientation-dependent and -independent parts. Results:
      
    

    
      Using the phenomenological method on the classical signal model, the well-known separation of R 2 *  into orientation-dependent and -independent parts was verified. For the proposed model, no significant orientation dependence in the linear signal decay parameter was observed. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Since the proposed second-order model features orientation-dependent and -independent components at distinct temporal orders, it can be used to remove the orientation dependence of R 2 *  using only a single GRE measurement.","['1 Department of Systems Neurosciences, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', '2 Department of Neurophysics, Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Leipzig, Germany.', '3 Neurocomputation and Neuroimaging Unit, Department of Education and Psychology, Freie Universität Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', '4 Paul Flechsig Institute of Brain Research, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', '5 Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, UCL Institute of Neurology, London, United Kingdom.']","Sebastian Papazoglou, Tobias Streubel, Mohammad Ashtarayeh, Kerrin J Pine, Luke J Edwards, Malte Brammerloh, Evgeniya Kirilina, Markus Morawski, Carsten Jäger, Stefan Geyer, Martina F Callaghan, Nikolaus Weiskopf, Siawoosh Mohammadi, ",Magnetic resonance in medicine,2019 Nov,"R

1609,One Thousand and One Software for Proteomics: Tales of the Toolmakers of Science,"Proteomics is a highly dynamic field driven by frequent introduction of new technological approaches, leading to high demand for new software tools and the concurrent development of many methods for data analysis, processing, and storage. The rapidly changing landscape of proteomics software makes finding a tool fit for a particular purpose a significant challenge. The comparison of software and the selection of tools capable to perform a certain operation on a given type of data rely on their detailed annotation using well-defined descriptors. However, finding accurate information including tool input/output capabilities can be challenging and often heavily depends on manual curation efforts. This is further hampered by a rather low half-life of most of the tools, thus demanding the maintenance of a resource with updated information about the tools. We present here our approach to curate a collection of 189 software tools with detailed information about their functional capabilities. We furthermore describe our efforts to reach out to the proteomics community for their engagement, which further increased the catalog to >750 tools being about 70% of the estimated number of 1097 tools existing for proteomics data analysis.

      Aneurysm wall biomechanics are not yet an integral part of aneurysm rupture risk evaluation. We aimed to develop a new technique describing the biomechanical properties of aneurysm wall and correlating them to rupture status. Methods:
      
    

    
      Aneurysm wall samples collected during surgery were submitted before and after freezing to tensile tests or as fresh samples to indentation tests. The lateral stiffness or the Young's modulus of the different samples was determined as a function of the mechanical test used. The impact of freezing on biomechanical properties was evaluated. The correlation of clinical and radiologic data with the biomechanical profile of the aneurysm samples was investigated. Two-photon microscopy was used to study collagen fiber organization. Results:
      
    

    
      Sixteen aneurysm samples (11 unruptured and 5 ruptured) were included. Freezing decreased tissue stiffness. No significant difference was found between ruptured and unruptured aneurysm wall samples regarding demographic characteristics, ethnicity, smoking status, arterial hypertension, site, size and shape of the aneurysm, PHASES score, mechanical profile, or overall Young's modulus. Indentation tests found that the rupture occurred in a restricted area of increased elastic capacity and unruptured areas had increased stiffness. Two-photon microscopy found disruption of the collagen fiber network in rupture zones. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The indentation test of fresh aneurysm wall samples described the heterogeneity of biomechanical properties of the tissue and found increased elastic capacity in the rupture zone and increased stiffness in the remainder of the aneurysm. This study could be a basis for further research aimed at building a biomechanical-based model of aneurysm rupture risk.","['1 Division of Neurosurgery, Department of Basic Medical Sciences, Neurosciences and Sense Organs, University ""Aldo Moro"" of Bari, Bari, Italy; Division of Neurosurgery, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France.

1611,Real-Time Study of the Adsorption and Grafting Process of Biomolecules by Means of Bloch Surface Wave Biosensors,"A combined label-free and fluorescence surface optical technique was used to quantify the mass deposited in binary biomolecular coatings. These coatings were constituted by fibronectin (FN), to stimulate endothelialization, and phosphorylcholine (PRC), for its hemocompatibility, which are two properties of relevance for cardiovascular applications. One-dimensional photonic crystals sustaining a Bloch surface wave were used to characterize different FN/PRC coatings deposited by a combination of adsorption and grafting processes. In particular, the label-free results permitted to quantitatively assess the mass deposited in FN adsorbed (185 ng/cm2) and grafted (160 ng/cm2). PRC binding to grafted FN coatings was also quantified, showing a coverage as low as 10 and 12 ng/cm2 for adsorbed and grafted PRC, respectively. Moreover, desorption of FN deposited by adsorption was detected and quantified upon the addition of PRC. The data obtained by the surface optical technique were complemented by water contact angle and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses. The results were in accordance with those obtained previously by qualitative and semiquantitative techniques (XPS, time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry) on several substrates (PTFE and stainless steel), confirming that grafted FN coatings show higher stability than those obtained by FN adsorption.","['1 Department of Basic and Applied Science for Engineering , SAPIENZA University of Rome , 00161 Rome , Italy.', '2 Laboratory for Biomaterials and Bioengineering (CRC-I), Department of Min-Met-Materials Engineering & CHU de Quebec Research Center , Laval University , Quebec City G1V0A6 , Canada.', '3 Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Optics and Precision Engineering IOF , 07745 Jena , Germany.', '4 Institute of Applied Physics ""Nello Carrara"" (IFAC), National Research Council of Italy (CNR) , Sesto Fiorentino, 50019 Firenze , Italy.']","A Sinibaldi, V Montaño-Machado, N Danz, P Munzert, F Chiavaioli, F Michelotti, D Mantovani, ",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2018,Bloch surface waves; coating characterization; fibronectin; fluorescence; optical biosensing; phosphorylcholine; photonic crystals.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30152997

To increase the course consistency, relevance, and student engagement, we have developed a research-inspired and project-based module, ""From Gene to Structure and Function"". This 2.5-week full-day biochemistry and structural biology module covers protein expression, purification, structure solving, and characterization. The module is centered around the flavodoxin-like protein NrdI, involved in the activation of the bacterial ribonucleotide reductase enzyme system. Through an in-depth focus on one specific protein, the students will learn the basic laboratory skills needed in order to generate a broader knowledge and breadth within the field. With respect to generic skills, the students report their findings as a scientific article, with the aim to learn to present concise research results and write scientific papers. The current research-inspired project has the potential of being further developed into a more discovery-driven project and extended to include other molecular biological techniques or biochemical/biophysical characterizations.

1613,Comparative Proteomics on Deep-Sea Amphipods after in Situ Copper Exposure,"The interest in deep-sea mining increased along with the environmental concerns of these activities to the deep-sea fauna. The discovery of optimal biomarkers of deep-sea mining activities in deep-sea species is a crucial step toward the supply of important ecological information for environmental impact assessment. In this study, an in situ copper exposure experiment was performed on deep-sea scavenging amphipods. Abyssorchomene distinctus individuals were selected among all the exposed amphipods for molecular characterization. Copper concentration within the gut was assessed, followed by a tandem mass tag-based coupled with two-dimensional liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) applied to identify and quantify the protein expression changes after 48 h of exposure. 2937 proteins were identified and annotated, and 1918 proteins among all identified proteins were assigned by at least two nonambiguous peptides. The screening process was performed based on the differences in protein abundance and the specific correlation between the proteins and copper in previous studies. These differentially produced proteins include Na+/K+ ATPase, cuticle, chitinase, and proteins with unknown function. Their abundances showed correlation with copper and had high sensitivity to indicate the copper level, being here proposed as biomarker candidates for deep-sea mining activities in the future. This is a key step in the development of environmental impact assessment of deep-sea mining activities integrating ecotoxicological data.","['1 Department of Ocean Science, Division of Life Science and Hong Kong Branch of the Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory , The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology , Hong Kong , China.', '2 Second Institute of Oceanography, Ministry of Natural Resources , Hangzhou 310012 , China.', '3 Key Laboratory of Marine Ecosystem and Biochemistry , State Oceanic Administration , Hangzhou 311000 , China.', '4 CIMA - Centro de Investigação Marinha e Ambiental , Universidade do Algarve , Campus de Gambelas, 8005-139 Faro , Portugal.']","Yick Hang Kwan, Dongsheng Zhang, Nélia C Mestre, Wai Chuen Wong, Xiaogu Wang, Bo Lu, Chunsheng Wang, Pei-Yuan Qian, Jin Sun, ",Environmental science & technology,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31638389
1614,Applicability and reliability of the glucose oxidase method in assessing α-amylase activity,"Glucose oxidase (GOD) is an enzyme widely used in glucose monitoring systems owing to its high specificity towards glucose. However, in our previous work maltose was found to show significant interaction with GOD and based on this observation, a novel microplate-based method was developed to assess α-amylase inhibitory activity (GOD method). Concerns regarding the interaction of GOD with maltose has limited the widespread use of the GOD method in assessing α-amylase activity. The present paper provides answers to concerns regarding the interaction of GOD with maltose using HPLC studies and application of the GOD method in assessing α-amylase activity. According to the results, the newly developed GOD method can be considered as a well-suited method for the determination of α-amylase activity and as an easy method to do kinetic studies compared to other available methods.","['1 Division of Nutritional Biochemistry, National Institute of Fundamental Studies, Hantana Road, Kandy, Sri Lanka; Postgraduate Institute of Science, University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka.', '2 Division of Nutritional Biochemistry, National Institute of Fundamental Studies, Hantana Road, Kandy, Sri Lanka.', '3 Division of Nutritional Biochemistry, National Institute of Fundamental Studies, Hantana Road, Kandy, Sri Lanka.

1615,Effect of each component of a LINAC therapy head on neutron and photon spectra,"Linear accelerators (LINACs) are widely applied in radiotherapy for their versatility and flexibility. Monte Carlo simulations were made to find the neutron and photon spectra at the isocenter (IC) of a LINAC operating at 10, 15, 18, and 24 MV by the MCNPX code. A detailed model of the LINAC head, consisting of flattening filter, secondary collimator, primary collimator, and multi-leaf collimator were used in the calculations. The effect of eliminating any of these components on contamination of a neutron spectrum and a photon spectrum was assessed. Photon and neutron ambient equivalent doses were found, and comparisons were made for the various structures. Lethargy neutron spectra at the IC were compared with spectra computed with the function reported by Tosi et al., which describes well neutron spectra for the energy region beyond 1 MeV, although tending to undervalue energy spectra below 1 MeV. The findings show that the photon and neutron fluences are enhanced when eliminating a LINAC component. The neutron and photon doses increased except when removing the primary collimator.","['1 Physics Department, Faculty of Sciences, Golestan University, Postal code: 49138-15739, Gorgan, Iran.

1617,Biophysical characterization of full-length human phenylalanine hydroxylase provides a deeper understanding of its quaternary structure equilibrium,"Dysfunction of human phenylalanine hydroxylase (hPAH, EC 1.14.16.1) is the primary cause of phenylketonuria, the most common inborn error of amino acid metabolism. The dynamic domain rearrangements of this multimeric protein have thwarted structural study of the full-length form for decades, until now. In this study, a tractable C29S variant of hPAH (C29S) yielded a 3.06 Å resolution crystal structure of the tetrameric resting-state conformation. We used size-exclusion chromatography in line with small-angle X-ray scattering (SEC-SAXS) to analyze the full-length hPAH solution structure both in the presence and absence of Phe, which serves as both substrate and allosteric activators. Allosteric Phe binding favors accumulation of an activated PAH tetramer conformation, which is biophysically distinct in solution. Protein characterization with enzyme kinetics and intrinsic fluorescence revealed that the C29S variant and hPAH are otherwise equivalent in their response to Phe, further supported by their behavior on various chromatography resins and by analytical ultracentrifugation. Modeling of resting-state and activated forms of C29S against SAXS data with available structural data created and evaluated several new models for the transition between the architecturally distinct conformations of PAH and highlighted unique intra- and inter-subunit interactions. Three best-fitting alternative models all placed the allosteric Phe-binding module 8-10 Å farther from the tetramer center than do all previous models. The structural insights into allosteric activation of hPAH reported here may help inform ongoing efforts to treat phenylketonuria with novel therapeutic approaches.","['1 From the Molecular Therapeutics Program, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Temple University Health Systems, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19111.', '2 the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19102, and.', '3 the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104.', '4 From the Molecular Therapeutics Program, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Temple University Health Systems, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19111, eileen.jaffe@fccc.edu.']","Emilia C Arturo, Kushol Gupta, Michael R Hansen, Elias Borne, Eileen K Jaffe, ",The Journal of biological chemistry,2019,ACT domain; X-ray crystallography; allosteric regulation; inborn error of metabolism; phenylalanine hydroxylase; phenylketonuria; protein conformation; resting-state structure; small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS); structural biology; structural modeling.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31076506
1618,Mimicry of a biophysical pathway leads to diverse pollen-like surface patterns,"A ubiquitous structural feature in biological systems is texture in extracellular matrix that gains functions when hardened, for example, cell walls, insect scales, and diatom tests. Here, we develop patterned liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) particles by recapitulating the biophysical patterning mechanism that forms pollen grain surfaces. In pollen grains, a phase separation of extracellular material into a pattern of condensed and fluid-like phases induces undulations in the underlying elastic cell membrane to form patterns on the cell surface. In this work, LCE particles with variable surface patterns were created through a phase separation of liquid crystal oligomers (LCOs) droplet coupled to homeotropic anchoring at the droplet interface, analogously to the pollen grain wall formation. Specifically, nematically ordered polydisperse LCOs and isotropic organic solvent (dichloromethane) phase-separate at the surface of oil-in-water droplets, while, different LCO chain lengths segregate to different surface curvatures simultaneously. This phase separation, which creates a distortion in the director field, is in competition with homeotropic anchoring induced by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). By tuning the polymer chemistry of the system, we are able to influence this separation process and tune the types of surface patterns in these pollen-like microparticles. Our study reveals that the energetically favorable biological mechanism can be leveraged to offer simple yet versatile approaches to synthesize microparticles for mechanosensing, tissue engineering, drug delivery, energy storage, and displays.","['1 Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104.', '2 Department of Physics & Astronomy, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104.', '3 School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138.', '4 Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104; shuyang@seas.upenn.edu.']","Jiaqi Liu, Asja Radja, Yuchong Gao, Rui Yin, Alison Sweeney, Shu Yang, ",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2020,elasticity; liquid crystal elastomers; phase separation; pollen grains; surface patterns.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32300006

1620,Mitochondrial Metabolism in Cancer. A Tangled Topic. Which Role for Proteomics?,"Given the role of mitochondria in modulating many cellular functions, it is not surprising that they can play a crucial role also in molecular pathophysiology of cancer. In particular, the discovery in recent decades of a link between cancer metabolic processes, alterations of mitochondrial DNA, oncogenes and tumor suppressors has led not only to a renaissance of interest in Warburg's pioneering work, but also to a reexamination of his original observations above all in relation to the current knowledge in cancer cell metabolism. It follows that, although mitochondrial contribution to the pathogenesis of cancer has historically tended to be neglected, it is now evident that reprogrammed mitochondria can contribute to a complex bioenergetic adjustment that sustains not only tumor formation but also its progression. Most importantly, cancer cell metabolism seems to have a role in diversified aspects related to cancer pathophysiology (i.e., aggressiveness, recurrence, metastatic dissemination). Hence, it is imperative to always consider cancer cell metabolism, its adaptability, its influences but, above all, its functional heterogeneity in a single tumor, for a really rational and valid approach towards molecular biology of cancer.","['1 Institute of Biochemistry and Clinical Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Catholic University, Rome, Italy.', '2 Institute of Biochemistry and Clinical Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Catholic University, Rome, Italy. roberto.scatena@unicatt.it.']","Patrizia Bottoni, Roberto Scatena, ",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,2019,Cancer cell metabolism; Cancer diagnosis; Cancer stem cells; Cancer therapy; Complex I; Oxidative phoshorylation; Tumor markers; Warburg effect.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31452132

In the process, a vast quantity of unrefined data, that can amount to several hundred gigabytes per tissue section, is produced. Managing, analysing and interpreting this data is a significant challenge and represents a major barrier to the translational application of MSI.

All these activities were executed in a course for Latin-American graduate students with no previous knowledge on X-ray crystallography entitled ""Crystallography in Structural Biology: why do we need a protein crystal, and how do we get it?."" We would like to share our experience with the educational research community, with the main purpose being to enrich teaching in biochemistry and structural molecular biology by performing a series of interesting laboratory and computer experiments. © 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 47(6):700-707, 2019.","['1 Fundación Instituto Leloir, IIBBA-CONICET, Av.

1625,ElVisML: an open data format for the exchange and storage of electrophysiological data in ophthalmology,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      The ISCEV standards and recommendations for electrophysiological recordings in ophthalmology define a set of protocols with stimulus parameters, acquisition settings, and recording conditions, to unify the data and enable comparability of results across centers. Up to now, however, there are no standards to define the storage and exchange of such electrophysiological recordings. The aim of this study was to develop an open standard data format for the exchange and storage of visual electrophysiological data (ElVisML). Methods:
      
    

    
      We first surveyed existing data formats for biomedical signals and examined their suitability for electrophysiological data in ophthalmology. We then compared the suitability of text-based and binary formats, as well as encoding in Extensible Markup Language (XML) and character/comma-separated values. Results:
      
    

    
      The results of the methodological consideration led to the development of ElVisML with an XML-encoded text-based format. This allows referential integrity, extensibility, the storing of accompanying units, as well as ensuring confidentiality and integrity of the data. A visualization of ElVisML documents (ElVisWeb) has additionally been developed, which facilitates the exchange of recordings on mailing lists and allows open access to data along with published articles. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The open data format ElVisML ensures the quality, validity, and integrity of electrophysiological data transmission and storage as well as providing manufacturer-independent access and long-term archiving in a future-proof format. Standardization of the format of such neurophysiology data would promote the development of new techniques and open software for the use of neurophysiological data in both clinic and research.","['1 Institute for Ophthalmic Research, University of Tuebingen, Elfriede-Aulhorn-Str. 7, 72076, Tübingen, Germany. torsten.strasser@uni-tuebingen.de.', '2 Institute for Ophthalmic Research, University of Tuebingen, Elfriede-Aulhorn-Str. 7, 72076, Tübingen, Germany.', '3 Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', '4 Werner Reichardt Centre for Integrative Neuroscience (CIN), University of Tuebingen, Tübingen, Germany.']","Torsten Strasser, Tobias Peters, Herbert Jägle, Eberhart Zrenner, ",Documenta ophthalmologica.

1627,From gene to structure: Lactobacillus bulgaricus D-lactate dehydrogenase from yogurt as an integrated curriculum model for undergraduate molecular biology and biochemistry laboratory courses,"We have developed an integrated, project-oriented curriculum for undergraduate molecular biology and biochemistry laboratory courses spanning two semesters that is organized around the ldhA gene from the yogurt-fermenting bacterium Lactobacillus bulgaricus, which encodes the enzyme d-lactate dehydrogenase. The molecular biology module, which consists of nine experiments carried out over eleven sessions, begins with the isolation of genomic DNA from L. bulgaricus in yogurt and guides students through the process of cloning the ldhA gene into a prokaryotic expression vector, followed by mRNA isolation and characterization of recombinant gene expression levels using RT-PCR. The biochemistry module, which consists of nine experiments carried out over eight sessions, begins with overexpression of the cloned ldhA gene and guides students through the process of affinity purification, biochemical characterization of the purified LdhA protein, and analysis of enzyme kinetics using various substrates and an inhibitor, concluding with a guided inquiry investigation of structure-function relationships in the three-dimensional structure of LdhA using molecular visualization software. Students conclude by writing a paper describing their work on the project, formatted as a manuscript to be submitted for publication in a scientific journal. Overall, this curriculum, with its emphasis on experiential learning, provides hands-on training with a variety of common laboratory techniques in molecular biology and biochemistry and builds experience with the process of scientific reasoning, along with reinforcement of essential transferrable skills such as critical thinking, information literacy, and written communication, all within the framework of an extended project having the look and feel of a research experience. © 2018 by The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 46(3):270-278, 2018.","['1 From the Department of Chemistry, Eastern University, St. Davids, Pennsylvania 19087.']","Jeffrey A Lawton, Noelle A Prescott, Ping X Lawton, ",Biochemistry and molecular biology education : a bimonthly publication of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,2018 May,Lactate dehydrogenase; Lactobacillus bulgaricus; project-based laboratory course.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29512269

In present investigation, CA15-3 has been purified from the culture supernatant of breast cancer T47-D cell line with 76% yield and 3350 fold purification. Isolated CA15-3 was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), immunoblotting (western blotting), chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). CA15-3 is a monomeric protein with an apparent molecular mass in between ∼250-350kDa. The FTIR spectroscopy revealed similar profiles of T47-D derived CA15-3 and commercially available CA15-3 protein. With the easy availability of T47-D cell line and a simple purification approach described here will support for the large scale production of CA15-3 to be used for various clinical and diagnostic applications.","['1 Laboratory of Cell Culture and Native Proteins, Research and Development Division, Yashraj Biotechnology Ltd., Navi Mumbai 400705, Maharashtra, India; Department of Medical Biotechnology, MGM Institute of Health Sciences, Kamothe, Navi Mumbai 410209, Maharashtra, India.', '2 Laboratory of Cell Culture and Native Proteins, Research and Development Division, Yashraj Biotechnology Ltd., Navi Mumbai 400705, Maharashtra, India.', '3 Department of Molecular-Cellular Biology and Biochemistry, National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health, Jehangir Merwanji Street, Parel, Mumbai 400012, Maharashtra, India.', '4 Laboratory of Cell Culture and Native Proteins, Research and Development Division, Yashraj Biotechnology Ltd., Navi Mumbai 400705, Maharashtra, India; Department of Molecular-Cellular Biology and Biochemistry, National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health, Jehangir Merwanji Street, Parel, Mumbai 400012, Maharashtra, India.

1630,Effects of alpha and gamma transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) on verbal creativity and intelligence test performance,"Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation method that allows to directly modulate brain oscillations of a given frequency. Using this method, it was recently shown that increasing alpha (10Hz) oscillations improved creative ideation with figural material and that increasing gamma (40Hz) oscillations speeded up performance in a figural matrices intelligence task. The aim of the present study was to examine whether these findings generalize to verbal creativity and intelligence tasks. In addition, we explored whether the stimulation effects are moderated by individual differences in creative potential and intelligence. Twenty-two adults received 10Hz, 40Hz and sham tACS while they worked on a verbal creativity (alternate uses) task and a verbal intelligence (anagram) task. Analyses revealed that 10Hz stimulation had a marginally significant effect on ideational fluency in the alternate uses task, whereas originality was unaffected. The beneficial effect of stimulation on fluency tended to emerge mainly in the individuals with higher creative potential. In the verbal intelligence task, in contrast, 40Hz stimulation did neither impact on performance nor interacted with individual differences in intelligence. These findings provide first tentative evidence that enhancing alpha oscillations through tACS may improve creative thinking not only in the figural but also in the verbal domain. The previously reported beneficial effect of gamma tACS on figural intelligence, however, could not be observed in a verbal task. In sum, the present study further corroborates the causal link between alpha oscillations and creative thinking and suggests that tACS may be a promising tool to enhance cognitive processes.","['1 Institute of Psychology, University of Graz, Universitätsplatz 2, A-8010 Graz, Austria.

1631,Collaborating with Undergraduates To Contribute to Biochemistry Community Resources,"Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) have gained traction as effective ways to expand the impact of undergraduate research while fulfilling pedagogical goals. In this Perspective, we present innovative ways to incorporate fundamental benefits and principles of CUREs into a classroom environment through information/technology-based research projects that lead to student-generated contributions to digital community resources (CoRes). These projects represent an attractive class of CUREs because they are less resource-intensive than laboratory-based CUREs, and the projects align with the expectations of today's students to create rapid and publicly accessible contributions to society. We provide a detailed discussion of two example types of CoRe projects that can be implemented in courses to impact research and education at the chemistry-biology interface: bioinformatics annotations and development of educational tools. Finally, we present current resources available for faculty interested in incorporating CUREs or CoRe projects into their pedagogical practices. In sharing these stories and resources, we hope to lower the barrier for widespread adoption of CURE and CoRe approaches and generate discussions about how to utilize the classroom experience to make a positive impact on our students and the future of the field of biochemistry.","[""1 Department of Chemistry & Physics, Saint Mary's College , Notre Dame, Indiana 46556, United States."", '2 Department of Chemistry, Emory University , Atlanta, Georgia 30322, United States.', '3 Bioinformatics Group, Wageningen University , Droevendaalsesteeg 1, 6708PB Wageningen, The Netherlands.', '4 Department of Chemistry, Haverford College , Haverford, Pennsylvania 19041-1392, United States.']","Kathryn L Haas, Jennifer M Heemstra, Marnix H Medema, Louise K Charkoudian, ",Biochemistry,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29048882
1632,"Structural, functional, and evolutionary analysis of late embryogenesis abundant proteins (LEA) in Triticum aestivum: A detailed molecular level biochemistry using in silico approach","LEA (Late Embryogenesis Abundant) proteins are abundant in plants and play a crucial role in abiotic stress tolerance. In our work, we primarily focused on the variations in physiochemical properties, conserved domains, secondary structure, gene ontology and evolutionary relationships among 40 LEA proteins of Triticum aestivum (common wheat). Wheat LEA protein belongs to first 6 classes out of the 13 classes present in LEApdB, the comprehensive database for LEA proteins. Proteins belonging to each LEApdB class have structures and functions distinguished from other classes. The study found three different conserved LEA domains in Triticum aestivum. One important domain was dehydrin, present in wheat proteins of classes 1, 2 and 4, though varied in sequence level, have similar biological processes. The study also found sequence level and phylogenetic similarity between dehydrin domains of class 1 and 4, but distinct from that of LEApdB class 2. This study also demonstrated functional diversity in two class 6 proteins occurred due to many destabilizing mutations in the LEA4 domain that caused alteration of ligand binding and conformational shift from 310-helix → turn within the domain. The LEA4 domains of these proteins also showed functional similarity and evolutionary relatedness with three other proteins of genus Aegilops, denoting that these proteins in Triticum aestivum were derived from its ancestor Aegilops. The study also assigned LEApdB class 4 to an unclassified LEA protein 'WZY2-1' based on amino acid composition, conserved domain, motif architecture and phylogenetic relatedness with class 4 proteins. Our study has revealed a detailed analysis of LEA proteins in Triticum aestivum and can serve as a pillar for further investigations and comparative analysis of wheat LEA proteins with other cereal or plant types.","['1 Amity Institute of Biotechnology, Amity University, Kolkata, India.', '2 Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Kalyani, Kalyani, Nadia, India.', '3 Amity Institute of Biotechnology, Amity University, Kolkata, India.

1633,"If Squeezed, a Camel Passes Through the Eye of a Needle: Voltage-Mediated Stretching of Dendrimers Facilitates Passage Through a Nanopore","Herein, we report uni-molecular observations of electric potential- and electrolyte-dependent elasticity of poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM)-G1.5 dendrimers containing sodium carboxylate surface groups, using the electric field-assisted migration through the α-hemolysin nanopore (α-HL). Although at moderate transmembrane potentials the dendrimer (~ 2.5 nm in diameter) is sterically excluded from translocation across the constriction region of the nanopore (~ 1.5 nm in diameter), we found a threshold for its translocation that depends on both the electrolyte pH and ionic strength. We posit that the decreased repulsive intramolecular interactions among dendrimer's branches at low when compared to neutral pH, caused mainly by the protonation of surface groups on the dendrimer, determine a larger propensity of the dendrimer to collapse and deform. This in turns enables the dendrimer to adopt more favorably conformations that facilitate its optimal squeezing through the α-HL's constriction region at low pH, despite the fact that the estimated net force acting on it becomes approximately one order of magnitude lower than at neutral pH. Experiments performed in a low ionic strength buffer, which decreases Coulombic screening, enhance the intramolecular forces on the dendrimer and renders the dendrimer stiffer than in high ionic strength buffer, confirming the dendrimer elastic properties-dependent threshold for deformation inside the nanopore.","['1 Interdisciplinary Research Department, Alexandru I.

1635,Integration of proteomics and metabolomics reveals promotion of proliferation by exposure of bisphenol S in human breast epithelial MCF-10A cells,"Bisphenol S (BPS) has been reported to have similar estrogenic effects as bisphenol A (BPA). Considering the endocrine disrupting effects of BPS, in this study, we investigated the effects of BPS exposure on normal human breast epithelial cell line MCF-10A by using mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomics and quantitative proteomics. We found that exposure to BPS for 24 h altered the proliferation of MCF-10A cells in a hormetic manner with the highest proliferation rate at the dosage of 1 μM. A total of 200 proteins were identified to be significantly changed by 1 μM of BPS exposure. The upregulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Ras/mTOR-related proteins implied that EGFR-mediated pathways were involved in BPS-induced proliferation of MCF-10A cells. In addition, several proliferation-related protein markers were found to be elevated, such as MKI67 and CDH1, further indicating the promotion of proliferation by low dose of BPS exposure. Besides, 35 endogenous metabolites were found to be significantly changed. The joint pathway analysis of the altered metabolites and proteins suggested changes in pathways of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, purine metabolism, pyruvate metabolism and lipid metabolism, which were involved in sustaining cell proliferation and cellular signal transduction. Taken together, this study provides insights into the effects and the potential mechanisms of BPS on estrogen receptor α-negative normal breast cell line MCF-10A, broadening our knowledge about the risk of using BPS as the alternative of BPA.","['1 State Key Laboratory of Environmental and Biological Analysis, Department of Chemistry, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong, China; Department of Chemistry and Molecular Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', '2 State Key Laboratory of Environmental and Biological Analysis, Department of Chemistry, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong, China.', '3 Laboratory for Applied Technology of Sophisticated Analytical Instruments, Shandong Analysis and Test Centre, Qilu University of Technology, Shandong, China.', '4 State Key Laboratory of Environmental and Biological Analysis, Department of Chemistry, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong, China.

After spending my first 19 years in Los Angeles, I became somewhat of an academic nomad, studying and/or working in six universities in the United States and three in Sweden. In chronological order, I have a B.A. in Scandinavian languages and literature from UCLA, a Ph.D. in biochemistry from Uppsala University, and an M.S. in toxicology from the Karolinska Institute. I have been in schools of natural science, pharmacy, and medicine and have worked in multiple basic science departments and one clinical department. I have served as a research-track and tenured faculty member, department chair, associate dean, and dean. My research has spanned toxinology, biochemistry, toxicology, and pharmacology. Through all the moves, I have gained much and lost some. For the past 40 years, my interest has been cytochrome P450 structure-function and structure-activity relationships. My lab has focused on CYP2B enzymes using X-ray crystallography, site-directed mutagenesis, deuterium-exchange MS, isothermal titration calorimetry, and computational methods in conjunction with a variety of functional assays. This comprehensive approach has enabled detailed understanding of the structural basis of the remarkable substrate promiscuity of CYP2B enzymes. We also have investigated the mechanisms of CYP3A4 allostery using biophysical and advanced spectroscopic techniques, and discovered a pivotal role of P450-P450 interactions and of multiple-ligand binding. A major goal of this article is to provide lessons that may be useful to scientists in the early and middle stages of their careers and those more senior scientists contemplating an administrative move.","['1 Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut 06269 james.halpert@uconn.edu.']","James R Halpert, ",The Journal of biological chemistry,2020,CYP2B enzymes; chemical biology; cytochrome P450; pharmacology; structure-function; toxicology.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31953248

1639,"Performance evaluation of GPU parallelization, space-time adaptive algorithms, and their combination for simulating cardiac electrophysiology","The use of computer models as a tool for the study and understanding of the complex phenomena of cardiac electrophysiology has attained increased importance nowadays. At the same time, the increased complexity of the biophysical processes translates into complex computational and mathematical models. To speed up cardiac simulations and to allow more precise and realistic uses, 2 different techniques have been traditionally exploited: parallel computing and sophisticated numerical methods. In this work, we combine a modern parallel computing technique based on multicore and graphics processing units (GPUs) and a sophisticated numerical method based on a new space-time adaptive algorithm. We evaluate each technique alone and in different combinations: multicore and GPU, multicore and GPU and space adaptivity, multicore and GPU and space adaptivity and time adaptivity. All the techniques and combinations were evaluated under different scenarios: 3D simulations on slabs, 3D simulations on a ventricular mouse mesh, ie, complex geometry, sinus-rhythm, and arrhythmic conditions. Our results suggest that multicore and GPU accelerate the simulations by an approximate factor of 33×, whereas the speedups attained by the space-time adaptive algorithms were approximately 48. Nevertheless, by combining all the techniques, we obtained speedups that ranged between 165 and 498. The tested methods were able to reduce the execution time of a simulation by more than 498× for a complex cellular model in a slab geometry and by 165× in a realistic heart geometry simulating spiral waves. The proposed methods will allow faster and more realistic simulations in a feasible time with no significant loss of accuracy.","['1 Departamento de Ciência da Computação, Universidade Federal de São João de Rei, São João del-rei MG, Brazil.', '2 Departamento de Ciência da Computação e Programa em Modelagem Computacional, Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora, Juiz de Fora, MG, Brazil.', '3 Departamento de Matemática, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.', '4 Departamento de Ciência da Computação, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.', '5 Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, U.

However, the mechanism by which magnetic protein enables a biocompass is still under debate, mainly because of the absence of permanent magnetism in the magnetic protein at room temperature. Here, based on a widely accepted radical pair model of a biocompass, we propose a microscopic mechanism that allows the biocompass to operate without a finite magnetization of the magnetic protein in a biological environment. With the structure of the magnetic protein, we show that the magnetic fluctuation, rather than the permanent magnetism, of the magnetic protein can enable geomagnetic field sensing. An analysis of the quantum dynamics of our microscopic model reveals the necessary conditions for optimal sensitivity.

The proposed method relies on an automatic atlas-based segmentation of bone and lungs followed by an MRI intensity to synthetic Hounsfield unit conversion. Separate conversion algorithms were used for bone, lungs and soft-tissue. Rigidly registered CT and T2-weighted MR images of 30 patients in treatment position and with the same field of view were used for the evaluation of the atlas and the conversion algorithms. The dose calculation accuracy of the generated sCTs was verified for volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and pencil beam scanning (PBS). VMAT and PBS plans were robust optimized on an internal target volume (ITV) against a patient set-up uncertainty of 5 mm. Average differences between CT and sCT dose calculations for the ITV V 95% were 0.5% (min 0.0%; max 5.0%) and 0.0% (min -0.1%; max 0.1%) for VMAT and PBS dose distributions, respectively. Average differences for the mean dose to the organs at risk were <0.2% (min -0.6%; max 1.2%) and <0.2% (min -2.0%; max 2.6%) for VMAT and PBS dose distributions, respectively.

Metabolomics has been widely used in medicine, food science, crop and farm animal research, and other fields. Metabolomics can establish a more direct relationship between changes in the type and content of metabolites and phenotypes. Metabolomics has gradually become a new research method for the analysis of genetic mechanisms of complex traits following genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics with the advances in omics technology.

Then, we review the application of metabolomics in metabolic molecular identification of important economic traits in agricultural animals, disease diagnosis, meat quality and safety detection of animal products. We also introduce the latest achievements in the development, formation and analysis of important traits of animals and plants by using metabolomics, transcriptome, and genomics. Overall, the integrated analysis of metabolomics and other omics can comprehensively explain the genetic mechanism of all kinds of complex traits and help to improve the complete biological process of ""mutation-gene-expression-metabolism-phenotype"". Metabolomics provides a new method for the mechanism analysis of complex characters and a novel idea for new agricultural breeding.","['1 State Key Laboratory of Agro-Biotechnology, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China.', '2 College of Biological Sciences, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China.', '3 College of Animal Science and Technology, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China.', '4 Faculty of Animal Science and Technology, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming 650201, China.']","Jing Tian, Yu Zhe Wang, Shi Xiong Yan, Shuai Sun, Jun Jing Jia, Xiao Xiang Hu, ",Yi chuan = Hereditas,2020,agricultural animal; metabolome detection platform; metabolomics; multi-omics association analysis; widely targeted metabolomics.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32431297
1646,Robustness of Clonogenic Assays as a Biomarker for Cancer Cell Radiosensitivity,"Photon radiation therapy is a major curative treatment for cancer. However, the lack of robust predictive biomarkers for radiosensitivity precludes personalized radiation therapy. Clonogenic assays are the gold standard method for measuring the radiosensitivity of cancer cells. Although a large number of publications describe the use of clonogenic assays to measure cancer cell radiosensitivity, the robustness of results from different studies is unclear. To address this, we conducted a comprehensive detailed literature search of 256 common cancer cell lines and identified the eight cell lines most-frequently examined for photon sensitivity using clonogenic assays. Survival endpoints and experimental parameters from all 620 relevant experiments were compiled and analyzed. We found that the coefficients of variation for SF2 (surviving fraction after 2 Gy irradiation) and for D10 (dose that yields a surviving fraction of 10%) were below 30% for all cell lines, indicating that SF2 and D10 have acceptable inter-assay precision. These data support further analysis of published data on clonogenic assays using SF2 and D10 as survival endpoints, which facilitates robust identification of biological profiles representative of cancer cell sensitivity to photons.","['1 Department of Radiation Oncology, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Maebashi 371-8511, Japan.', '2 Department of Radiotherapy, Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo National General Hospital - Faculty of Medicine Universitas Indonesia, Jakarta 10430, Indonesia.', '3 Gunma University Initiative for Advanced Research (GIAR), Gunma University, Maebashi 371-8511, Japan.', '4 Department of Radiation Oncology, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Maebashi 371-8511, Japan. oiketakahiro@gmail.com.', '5 Gunma University Heavy Ion Medical Center, Maebashi 371-8511, Japan. oiketakahiro@gmail.com.']","Toshiaki Matsui, Endang Nuryadi, Shuichiro Komatsu, Yuka Hirota, Atsushi Shibata, Takahiro Oike, Takashi Nakano, ",International journal of molecular sciences,2019,cancer; clonogenic assays; precision medicine; radiation therapy; radiosensitivity.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31450688
1647,High-pressure photon ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry combined with dynamic purge-injection for rapid analysis of volatile metabolites in urine,"Small molecule metabolites are widely used as biomarkers in the research field of metabolomics for disease diagnosis and exposure assessment. As a readily available biofluid containing plenty of volatile organic metabolites (VOMs), urine is ideal for non-invasive metabolomic analysis; however, there is still lack of rapid analysis method for VOMs in urine. Here we report a kind of rapid method for urine analysis by employing high-pressure photon ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPPI-TOFMS) combined with dynamic purge-injection. Various types of metabolites, such as ketones, alcohols, acids, sulfides, pyrroles and amines were detected directly by simple acidification or alkalization of urines. It is noteworthy that nitrogen-containing compounds, especially polar amines, could be ultrasensitively measured without any derivatization. The analytical capability of the direct HPPI-MS technique was demonstrated by analyzing five valuable metabolites, i.e., toluene, 2,5-dimethylpyrrole, trimethlyamine, styrene, and p-xylene, which exhibited relatively low limits of detection, wide linear range and satisfactory repeatability. Being highly sensitive and humidity-friendly, the whole analytical procedure is easily operated in less than 6 min. Interestingly, a new biomarker 2,5-dimethylpyrrole was exclusively found in the smoker's urine sample besides toluene. The work presents a novel tool for rapid nontarget disease biomarkers screening or target monitoring of specific compounds through the investigation of volatile metabolites in urine.","[""1 Key Laboratory of Separation Science for Analytical Chemistry, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 457 Zhongshan Road, Dalian 116023, People's Republic of China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, 19 Yuquan Road, Beijing 100039, People's Republic of China."", ""2 Key Laboratory of Separation Science for Analytical Chemistry, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 457 Zhongshan Road, Dalian 116023, People's Republic of China."", ""3 Department of Instrumentation and Electrical Engineering, Jilin University, Jilin 130021, People's Republic of China."", ""4 Key Laboratory of Separation Science for Analytical Chemistry, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 457 Zhongshan Road, Dalian 116023, People's Republic of China.

1648,Wheat Height Estimation Using LiDAR in Comparison to Ultrasonic Sensor and UAS,"As one of the key crop traits, plant height is traditionally evaluated manually, which can be slow, laborious and prone to error. Rapid development of remote and proximal sensing technologies in recent years allows plant height to be estimated in more objective and efficient fashions, while research regarding direct comparisons between different height measurement methods seems to be lagging. In this study, a ground-based multi-sensor phenotyping system equipped with ultrasonic sensors and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) was developed. Canopy heights of 100 wheat plots were estimated five times during a season by the ground phenotyping system and an unmanned aircraft system (UAS), and the results were compared to manual measurements. Overall, LiDAR provided the best results, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.05 m and an R² of 0.97. UAS obtained reasonable results with an RMSE of 0.09 m and an R² of 0.91. Ultrasonic sensors did not perform well due to our static measurement style. In conclusion, we suggest LiDAR and UAS are reliable alternative methods for wheat height evaluation.","['1 Biological Systems Engineering Department, University of Nebraska⁻Lincoln, Lincoln, NE 68503, USA. wenan.yuan@huskers.unl.edu.', '2 Biological Systems Engineering Department, University of Nebraska⁻Lincoln, Lincoln, NE 68503, USA. jiatingli@huskers.unl.edu.', '3 Department of Agronomy and Horticulture, University of Nebraska⁻Lincoln, Lincoln, NE 68503, USA. madhav.bhatta@huskers.unl.edu.', '4 Biological Systems Engineering Department, University of Nebraska⁻Lincoln, Lincoln, NE 68503, USA. yshi18@unl.edu.', '5 Department of Agronomy and Horticulture, University of Nebraska⁻Lincoln, Lincoln, NE 68503, USA. pbaenziger1@unl.edu.', '6 Biological Systems Engineering Department, University of Nebraska⁻Lincoln, Lincoln, NE 68503, USA. yge2@unl.edu.']","Wenan Yuan, Jiating Li, Madhav Bhatta, Yeyin Shi, P Stephen Baenziger, Yufeng Ge, ","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2018,crop; phenotyping; plant breeding; proximal sensing; remote sensing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30400154

He celebrated with a small group of colleagues and friends on behalf of the many inspired by him over his lifetime-whether scientists, artists, or philosophers. A small group of friends, because many-who by their breakthroughs have changed the face of science in different research areas-have already died. But it was a special day, devoted to the many genius facets of Manfred Eigen's oeuvre, and a day to highlight the way in which he continues to exude a great, vital and unbroken passion for science as well as an insatiable curiosity beyond his own scientific interests. He continues to dismiss arguments such as, that scientific problems cannot be solved because of a current lack of appropriate tools, or because of the persuasion of the community that certain things are immeasurable. He has lived up to and accepted only the highest scientific standards with his fundamental contributions in widely differing research fields, for which he has received numerous prizes and honorary doctorates, including the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1967. Some of his outstanding contributions to science and technology are honored in the following chapters. Here, we will report some characteristic traits of Manfred Eigen, and his personal development. We highlight his visionary foresight regarding how multidisciplinary science should combine to study the complex processes of life and its evolution in establishing an institute that applied biological, chemical, and physical methods, and how his vision became sustained reality.","['1 Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Am Faßberg 11, 37077, Göttingen, Germany. hjaeckl@gwdg.de.', '2 Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Am Faßberg 11, 37077, Göttingen, Germany.', '3 Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology, 1919-1 Tancha, Onna, Kunigami, Okinawa, 904-0495, Japan.']","Herbert Jäckle, Carmen Rotte, Peter Gruss, ",European biophysics journal : EBJ,2018 May,Manfred Eigen.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29230510
1652,Online daily adaptive proton therapy,"It is recognized that the use of a single plan calculated on an image acquired some time before the treatment is generally insufficient to accurately represent the daily dose to the target and to the organs at risk. This is particularly true for protons, due to the physical finite range. Although this characteristic enables the generation of steep dose gradients, which is essential for highly conformal radiotherapy, it also tightens the dependency of the delivered dose to the range accuracy. In particular, the use of an outdated patient anatomy is one of the most significant sources of range inaccuracy, thus affecting the quality of the planned dose distribution. A plan should be ideally adapted as soon as anatomical variations occur, ideally online. In this review, we describe in detail the different steps of the adaptive workflow and discuss the challenges and corresponding state-of-the art developments in particular for an online adaptive strategy.","['1 Paul Scherrer Institute, Center for Proton Therapy, Switzerland.', '2 Department of Physics, ETH Zurich, Switzerland.']","Francesca Albertini, Michael Matter, Lena Nenoff, Ye Zhang, Antony Lomax, ",The British journal of radiology,2020 Mar,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31647313

1654,Integration of metabolomics and transcriptomics in nanotoxicity studies,"Biomedical research involving nanoparticles has produced useful products with medical applications. However, the potential toxicity of nanoparticles in biofluids, cells, tissues, and organisms is a major challenge. The '-omics' analyses provide molecular profiles of multifactorial biological systems instead of focusing on a single molecule. The 'omics' approaches are necessary to evaluate nanotoxicity because classical methods for the detection of nanotoxicity have limited ability in detecting miniscule variations within a cell and do not accurately reflect the actual levels of nanotoxicity. In addition, the 'omics' approaches allow analyses of in-depth changes and compensate for the differences associated with high-throughput technologies between actual nanotoxicity and results from traditional cytotoxic evaluations. However, compared with a single omics approach, integrated omics provides precise and sensitive information by integrating complex biological conditions. Thus, these technologies contribute to extended safety evaluations of nanotoxicity and allow the accurate diagnoses of diseases far earlier than was once possible in the nanotechnology era. Here, we review a novel approach for evaluating nanotoxicity by integrating metabolomics with metabolomic profiling and transcriptomics, which is termed ""metabotranscriptomics"".

1656,Principles and basics of immunohistochemistry,"Immunohistochemistry is a widely used technique, which visualize and observe specific substances present in cells, tissues, organs, and individuals, in many research field applying various and specific molecular recognition mechanisms that exist in the living body, so called antibody-antigen reaction. Morphology is what observes using a microscope such as light microscope, electron microscope, fluorescence microscope, confocal laser scanning microscope, and biochemistry is what detects the presence of substances in cells or tissues using immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, etc. Immunohistochemistry is a research method combining morphology and biochemistry. A brief summary of this basic step is to react with ""antibody"" that specifically binds to an ""antigen"", and ""visualize"" the site where the antigen-antibody reaction has taken place and observe it microscopically. In the immunohistological steps, there are several important points. The first of which is to detect a substance (antigen) to be searched for clearly, easily and reproducibly using a ""good primary antibody"". The second is the need to immobilize or fix substances (antigens) in tissues and cells. For this, fixation is performed. Fixation may, on the one hand, lead to a change in the molecular structure of the antigen, resulting in suppression of the antigen-antibody reaction. It is therefore necessary to overcome the reciprocity problem of fixation and immunostaining. The third is ""visualization"". It must not only be visible, but must be able to be specific and clear. It is very important to be able to discriminate the correct immunohistochemical reaction while being aware of these points, and not to make a judgment on detection as a result of false detection. In addition, control experiments for that purpose are always important points to be aware of.","['1 Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology, Graduate School of Medicine, Nippon Medical School.']","Hitoshi Ozawa, ",Nihon yakurigaku zasshi.

However, current technology is limited by a 'multiplexing ceiling' from existing optical materials. Here we engineered a class of polyyne-based materials for optical supermultiplexing. We achieved 20 distinct Raman frequencies, as 'Carbon rainbow', through rational engineering of conjugation length, bond-selective isotope doping and end-capping substitution of polyynes. With further probe functionalization, we demonstrated ten-color organelle imaging in individual living cells with high specificity, sensitivity and photostability. Moreover, we realized optical data storage and identification by combinatorial barcoding, yielding to our knowledge the largest number of distinct spectral barcodes to date. Therefore, these polyynes hold great promise in live-cell imaging and sorting as well as in high-throughput diagnostics and screening.","['1 Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.', '2 Kavli Institute for Brain Science, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.']","Fanghao Hu, Chen Zeng, Rong Long, Yupeng Miao, Lu Wei, Qizhi Xu, Wei Min, ",Nature methods,2018 Mar,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29334378
1658,Porous Nanophotonic Optomechanical Beams for Enhanced Mass Adsorption,"We have developed a porous silicon nanocantilever for a nano-optomechanical system (NOMS) with a universal sensing surface for enhanced sensitivity. Using electron beam lithography, we selectively applied a V2O5/HF stain etch to the mechanical elements while protecting the silicon-on-insulator photonic ring resonators. This simple, rapid, and electrodeless approach generates tunable device porosity simultaneously with the mechanical release step. By controlling the porous etchant concentration and etch time, the porous etch depth, resonant frequency, and the adsorption surface area could be precisely manipulated. Using this control, cantilever sensors ranging from nonporous to fully porous were fabricated and tested as gas-phase mass sensors of volatile organic compounds coming from a gas chromatography stream. The fully porous cantilever produced a dramatic 10-fold increase in sensing signal and a 6-fold improvement in limit of detection (LOD) compared to an otherwise identical nonporous cantilever. This signal improvement could be separated into mass responsivity increase and adsorption increase components. Allan deviation measurements indicate that a further 4-fold improvement in LOD could be expected upon speeding up characteristic peak response time from 1 s to 50 ms. These results show promise for performance enhancement in nanomechanical sensors for applications in gas sensing, gas chromatography, and mass spectrometry.","['1 Nanotechnology Research Centre , National Research Council of Canada , Edmonton , Alberta T6G 2M9 , Canada.', '2 Department of Physics , University of Alberta , Edmonton , Alberta T6G 2E1 , Canada.', '3 Department of Biological Sciences , University of Alberta , Edmonton , Alberta T6G 2R3 , Canada.', '4 Department of Computing Science , University of Alberta , Edmonton , Alberta T6G 2E8 , Canada.']","Anandram Venkatasubramanian, Vincent T K Sauer, Jocelyn N Westwood-Bachman, Kai Cui, Mike Xia, David S Wishart, Wayne K Hiebert, ",ACS sensors,2019,NOMS; gas chromatography; gas sensing; mass sensing; porosity.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30942578

1662,A Comprehensive Method for Accurate Strain Distribution Measurement of Cell Substrate Subjected to Large Deformation,"Cell mechanical stretching in vitro is a fundamental technique commonly used in cardiovascular mechanobiology research. Accordingly, it is crucial to measure the accurate strain field of cell substrate under different strains. Digital image correlation (DIC) is a widely used measurement technique, which is able to obtain the accurate displacement and strain distribution. However, the traditional DIC algorithm used in digital image correlation engine (DICe) cannot obtain accurate result when utilized in large strain measurement. In this paper, an improved method aiming to acquire accurate strain distribution of substrate in large deformation was proposed, to evaluate the effect and accuracy, based on numerical experiments. The results showed that this method was effective and highly accurate. Then, we carried out uniaxial substrate stretching experiments and applied our method to measure strain distribution of the substrate. The proposed method could obtain accurate strain distribution of substrate film during large stretching, which would allow researchers to adequately describe the response of cells to different strains of substrate.","['1 College of Materials Science and Engineering, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610065, China.', '2 College of Architecture and Environment, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610065, China.']","Hong He, Rong Zhou, Yuanwen Zou, Xuejin Huang, Jinchuan Li, ",Journal of healthcare engineering,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29599957

1664,Hydrogen Bond Enhanced Halogen Bonds: A Synergistic Interaction in Chemistry and Biochemistry,"The halogen bond (XB) has become an important tool for molecular design in all areas of chemistry, including crystal and materials engineering and medicinal chemistry. Its similarity to the hydrogen bond (HB) makes the relationship between these interactions complex, at times competing against and other times orthogonal to each other. Recently, our two laboratories have independently reported and characterized a synergistic relationship, in which the XB is enhanced through direct intramolecular HBing to the electron-rich belt of the halogen. In one study, intramolecular HBing from an amine polarizes the iodopyridinium XB donors of a bidentate anion receptor. The resulting HB enhanced XB (or HBeXB) preorganizes and further augments the XB donors. Consequently, the affinity of the receptor for halogen anions was significantly increased. In a parallel study, a meta-chlorotyrosine was engineered into T4 lysozyme, resulting in a HBeXB that increased the thermal stability and activity of the enzyme at elevated temperatures. The crystal structure showed that the chlorine of the noncanonical amino acid formed a XB to the protein backbone, which augmented the HB of the wild-type enzyme. Calorimetric analysis resulted in an enthalpic contribution of this Cl-XB to the stability of the protein that was an order of magnitude greater than previously determined in biomolecules. Quantum mechanical (QM) calculations showed that rotating the hydroxyl group of the tyrosine to point toward rather than away from the halogen greatly increased its potential to serve as a XB donor, equivalent to what was observed experimentally. In sum, the two systems described here show that the HBeXB concept extends the range of interaction energies and geometries to be significantly greater than that of the XB alone. Additionally, surveys of structural databases indicate that the components for this interaction are already present in many existing molecular systems. The confluence of the independent studies from our two laboratories demonstrates the reach of the HBeXB across both chemistry and biochemistry and that intentional engineering of this enhanced interaction will extend the applications of XBs beyond these two initial examples.","['1 Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry , University of Montana , Missoula , Montana 59812 , United States.', '2 Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology , Colorado State University , Fort Collins , Colorado 80523 , United States.', '3 Department of Chemistry , Colorado State University , Fort Collins , Colorado 80523 , United States.']","Asia Marie S Riel, Rhianon K Rowe, Ethan N Ho, Anna-Carin C Carlsson, Anthony K Rappé, Orion B Berryman, Pui Shing Ho, ",Accounts of chemical research,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31318520

1666,Validity of the +1.50 plus lens screening test as a predictor of uncorrected moderate hyperopia,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      Screening for uncorrected hyperopia in school children is important given its association with poorer visual function and academic performance. However, standard distance visual acuity screening may not detect low to moderate hyperopia. The plus lens test is used to screen for hyperopia in many school screening protocols, but has not been well validated. The current study investigated the effectiveness of the plus lens test to identify hyperopia in school children. Methods:
      
    

    
      Participants included Grade 2 school children. Monocular distance visual acuity (logMAR letter chart) was measured unaided, and then through a +1.50D lens, known as the plus lens test. Cycloplegic refraction was undertaken to classify moderate hyperopia (≥+2.00D). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) were calculated for commonly used cut-offs for the plus lens test: 6/6, 6/9 and less than two lines difference between unaided acuity and acuity through the plus lens test. Results:
      
    

    
      The sample included 59 children (mean age 7.2 ± 0.4 years). Fourteen (24%) children were classified as having uncorrected hyperopia. The sensitivity and specificity of the +1.50 plus lens test for identifying hyperopia were 0% and 98% respectively for a 6/6 cut-off, 29% and 91% for 6/9 cut-off, and 50% and 76% for a <2 line reduction between unaided acuity and acuity through the plus lens test. Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) analysis revealed area under curves of 0.69 based on acuity through the plus lens test, and 0.65 for a reduction in acuity through the plus lens test. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The plus lens test has low sensitivity for detecting uncorrected hyperopia using traditional cut-offs of 6/9 or better. This raises questions about the role of the plus lens test in school screening batteries.","['1 School of Optometry and Vision Science, Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia.', '2 School of Early Childhood and Inclusive Education, Faculty of Education, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia.']","Shelley Hopkins, Alex A Black, Sonia L White, Joanne M Wood, ",Ophthalmic & physiological optics : the journal of the British College of Ophthalmic Opticians (Optometrists),2019 May,children's vision; hyperopia; plus lens test; vision screening.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30994200

1668,FastFeedback Questions: A new teaching method,"In Australian Universities, based on a study from 1992 to 2014, the Feedback item has been consistently poorly rated by students. In addition, Biochemistry is a complex STEM subject which many students find difficult and was considered the hardest subject according to a recent study by Antigua medical school in the United States. In this work, a new and interactive teaching method, FastFeedback Questions (FFQs), has been devised. FFQs are a rapid formative feedback method that involves embedding carefully crafted focus questions alongside PowerPoint slides (outside the slide field). The PPT is then projected as usual, but not in slide show mode, so the areas outside the main slide window are visible to the students. Prior to the lecture students receive a version without the answers. During the face-to-face lecture, the lecturer goes through the answers in an interactive way by requesting that students answer the FFQs, which can be verified immediately from the PPT slide. The focus questions not only increase students' understanding of the slides, they also model good answers. FFQs were delivered to the students of third year clinical biochemistry at Curtin University. Number of students in this study, n = 311. The final exam marks support the use of FFQs as there is an overall improvement of the student average grade by ≈10% from ≈63% in 2010-2014 (no FFQs) to ≈72.6% in 2015-2017 (FFQs). FFQs have also gained the accolade of the students as their feedback was on average ≈97% compared to ≈80.5% for the Faculty and University. © 2017 by The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 46(2):121-129, 2018.","['1 School of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Health Sciences, Curtin University, Western Australia.', '2 Center of Excellence, Department of Polymers, National Research Center, Cairo, Egypt.']","Magdy Mahmoud Elnashar, ",Biochemistry and molecular biology education : a bimonthly publication of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,2018 Mar,New teaching method; PowerPoint; engagement; feedback; rapid formative assessment.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29219232
1669,A comprehensive practical laboratory course on protein engineering: Evolution of a glycine oxidase variant active on the herbicide glyphosate,"Protein engineering represents a modern approach to generate novel proteins for the different fields of biotechnology. Here, we report about an 8-day laboratory activity in which students generate enzyme variants to degrade the herbicide glyphosate. The students conduct a true research experiment in an important field (bioremediation by novel, engineered enzymes) and are introduced to widely used techniques in molecular biology and protein biochemistry laboratories. Based on a docking analysis of glycine (the original substrate) and of glyphosate into the active site of glycine oxidase, residues putatively involved in substrate selectivity are identified that will become the target of site-saturation mutagenesis. Each group of students focuses on the library generated at one position and selects the most active variant based on colorimetric screening. Following protein overexpression in Escherichia coli, the selected glycine oxidase variants are purified and their kinetic properties on glycine and glyphosate assessed. The best variant identified by the whole class is then used for detecting the herbicide in water. With the help of the professor, students can improve technical skills, ability to evaluate results, team work activity, and critical thinking. © 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 47(6):689-699, 2019.","['1 Department of Biotechnology and Life Sciences, University of Insubria, Varese, Italy.']","Elena Rosini, Loredano Pollegioni, ",Biochemistry and molecular biology education : a bimonthly publication of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,2019 Nov,Site-saturation mutagenesis; active learning/upper-level laboratory activity; colorimetric screening; kinetic properties.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31444933

While there have been a number of reviews on microneurography, this paper takes an objective approach to exploring the impact of microneurography studies. Briefly, Web of Science (Thomson Reuters) was used to identify the highest citation articles over the past 50 years, and key findings are presented in a decade-by-decade highlight. This includes the establishment of microneurography in the 1960s, the acceleration of the technique by Gunnar Wallin in the 1970s, the international collaborations of the 1980s and 1990s, and finally the highest impact studies from 2000 to present. This journey through 50 years of microneurographic research related to peripheral sympathetic nerve activity includes a historical context for several of the laboratory interventions commonly used today (e.g., cold pressor test, mental stress, lower body negative pressure, isometric handgrip, etc.) and how these interventions and experimental approaches have advanced our knowledge of cardiovascular, cardiometabolic, and other human diseases and conditions.","['1 Department of Kinesiology and Integrative Physiology, Michigan Technological University , Houghton, Michigan.']","Jason R Carter, ",Journal of neurophysiology,2019,autonomic nervous system; cardiovascular disease; microneurographic; muscle sympathetic nerve activity; orthostatic intolerance.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30673363
1672,The potential of photon-counting CT for quantitative contrast-enhanced imaging in radiotherapy,"The aim of this study is to use a simulation environment to evaluate the potential of using photon-counting CT (PCCT) against dual-energy CT (DECT) in the context of quantitative contrast-enhanced CT for radiotherapy. An adaptation of Bayesian eigentissue decomposition by Lalonde et al (2017 Med. Phys. 44 5293-302) that incorporates the estimation of contrast agent fractions and virtual non-contrast (VNC) parameters is proposed, and its performance is validated against conventional maximum likelihood material decomposition methods for single and multiple contrast agents. PCCT and DECT are compared using two simulation frameworks: one including ideal CT numbers with image-based Gaussian noise and another defined as a virtual patient with projection-based Poisson noise and beam hardening artifacts, with both scenarios considering spectral distortion for PCCT. The modalities are compared for their accuracy in estimating four key physical parameters: (1) the contrast agent fraction, as well as VNC parameters relevant to radiotherapy such as the (2) electron density, (3) proton stopping power and (4) photon linear attenuation coefficient. Considering both simulation frameworks, a reduction of root mean square (RMS) errors with PCCT is noted for all physical parameters evaluated, with the exception of the error on the contrast agent fraction being about constant through modalities in the virtual patient. Notably, for the virtual patient, RMS errors on VNC electron density and stopping power are respectively reduced from 2.0% to 1.4% and 2.7% to 1.4% when going from DECT to PCCT with four energy bins. The increase in accuracy is comparable to the differences between contrast-enhanced and non-contrast DECT. This study suggests that in a realistic simulation environment, the overall accuracy of radiotherapy-related parameters can be increased when using PCCT with four energy bins instead of DECT. This confirms the potential of PCCT to provide robust and quantitative tissue parameters for contrast-enhanced CT required in radiotherapy applications.","['1 Département de physique, Université de Montréal, Pavillon Roger-Gaudry (D-428), 2900 boulevard Édouard-Montpetit, Montréal, Québec H3T 1J4, Canada.

It uses an artificial neural network (ANN) to learn the angular response function (ARF) of a collimator-detector system. The ANN is trained once from a complete simulation including the complete detector head with collimator, crystal, and digitization process. In the simulation, particle tracking inside the SPECT head is replaced by a plane. Photons are stopped at the plane and the energy and direction are used as input to the ANN, which provides detection probabilities in each energy window. Compared to histogram-based ARF, the proposed method is less dependent on the statistics of the training data, provides similar simulation efficiency, and requires less training data.

In this work, we used a computational strategy to visualize three-dimensional (3D) structures of proteins and DNA and help the student to comprehend biochemistry concepts such as protein structure and function, substrate, and inhibitors as well as DNA structural features. The practical classes included tutorials to be done in the computer using structures from Protein Data Bank and a free 3D structure visualization software, Swiss PDB Viewer. The activity was done with 76 students from biology and pharmacy undergraduate courses. Questionnaires were administered to evaluate the knowledge regarding specific biochemistry contents before and after the activity and the opinion of the students. An overall increased percentage of correct answers post-classes (75.91%) were observed in comparison to pre-classes (35.53%). All the students indicated that it could contribute to the learning of DNA and protein structure contents; approximately 90% stated that it enables structures visualization or makes the learning and understanding easier.

1675,Analysis of oscillatory rocking curve by dynamical diffraction in protein crystals,"High-quality protein crystals meant for structural analysis by X-ray diffraction have been grown by various methods. The observation of dynamical diffraction in protein crystals is an interesting topic because dynamical diffraction generally occurs in perfect crystals such as Si crystals. However, to our knowledge, there is no report yet on protein crystals showing clear dynamical diffraction. We wonder whether the perfection of protein crystals might still be low compared with that of high-quality Si crystals. Here, we present observations of the oscillatory profile of rocking curves for protein crystals such as glucose isomerase crystals. The oscillatory profiles are in good agreement with those predicted by the dynamical theory of diffraction. We demonstrate that dynamical diffraction occurs even in protein crystals. This suggests the possibility of the use of dynamical diffraction for the determination of the structure and charge density of proteins.","['1 Graduate School of Nanobioscience, Yokohama City University, 236-0027 Yokohama, Japan.', '2 Institute for Materials Research, Tohoku University, 980-8577 Sendai, Japan.', '3 Institute of Materials Structure Science, High Energy Accelerator Research Organization, Tsukuba, 305-0801 Ibaraki, Japan.', '4 Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute, SPring-8, Sayo-cho, Sayo-gun, 679-5198 Hyogo, Japan.', '5 Department of Education, Yokohama Soei University, Midori-ku, 226-0015 Yokohama, Japan.', '6 Graduate School of Nanobioscience, Yokohama City University, 236-0027 Yokohama, Japan; tachiban@yokohama-cu.ac.jp.']","Ryo Suzuki, Haruhiko Koizumi, Keiichi Hirano, Takashi Kumasaka, Kenichi Kojima, Masaru Tachibana, ",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2018,X-ray topography; dynamical diffraction; glucose isomerase; protein crystal; rocking curve.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29563230

It is unique among general-purpose software packages where it integrates the control of cellular imaging and electrophysiological devices, as well as sophisticated data analyses, which provides superior usability in imaging experiments combined with electrophysiology. During the development over the last 20 years, the range of supported image acquisition devices has expanded from cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras to multi-photon microscope systems. In this review, I outline the concept of TI Workbench together with its unique functions and features derived from ideas emerging during daily experiments in my own lab and in those of my collaborators over the last 20 years. TI Workbench includes standard functions required for time-lapse multicolor fluorescence imaging and electrophysiological experiments, in addition to specialized functions such as random-scan or conventional raster-scan two-photon microscopy packages and fluorescence life time imaging (FLIM) utilities. Data analysis modules, e.g. digital data filters for temporal waveforms of time-lapse image data and electrophysiology and for 2-D image data, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) analysis functions, are well integrated with data acquisition functions. A notebook function holds formatted text, graphs, image and movie data altogether, which are linked to the actual data files. TI Workbench uses Igor Pro software as a back-end output for publishing. In addition, TI Workbench imports several different formats of image and electrophysiology data, serving as a general-purpose data analysis software package.","['1 Department of Life Science and Medical Bioscience, Waseda University, 2-2 Wakamatsu-cho, Shinjuku, Tokyo 162-8480, Japan.']","Takafumi Inoue, ","Microscopy (Oxford, England)",2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29554288
1677,"Biochemical markers of time since death in cerebrospinal fluid: A first step towards ""Forensomics""","The accurate estimation of the time of death is a challenge in forensic medicine, as the methods routinely used to assess the postmortem interval (PMI) are far from being precise. Over the past decades, biochemical methods have been implemented on postmortem samples to improve the precision of PMI estimation. Studies have focussed on the biochemical profiles of closed compartment body fluids, as they are preserved longer than blood after death and are thus subject to confined postmortem chemical changes. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has been considered a suitable fluid to investigate these changes, as it is found in large amounts and is easy to sample. Moreover, the main molecules found in CSF have known reference values in living subjects, unlike most other body fluids. In this literature review, we focus on the panel of biomarkers that have been studied in CSF based on their potential of offering information on the time of death. The interest in these biomarkers for casework and the research perspectives in this field are discussed. Integrating data from different methods, including biochemistry, for better estimation of the time of death would represent a step forward in the forensic field, paving the way for an innovative approach that we suggest to call ""Forensomics.""","['1 a Department of Forensic Medicine , Montpellier University Hospital , Montpellier , France.', '2 b Laboratory of Biochemistry and Clinical Proteomics, Montpellier University Hospital, Institute for Regenerative Medicine and Biotherapy , Montpellier , France.']","Pierre-Antoine Peyron, Sylvain Lehmann, Constance Delaby, Eric Baccino, Christophe Hirtz, ",Critical reviews in clinical laboratory sciences,2019 Jun,Biomarkers; biochemistry; cerebrospinal fluid; forensic medicine; time of death.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31088325

      The aim of this study is to commission and validate the portal dosimetry (PD) system using an indirect method for flattening filter free (FFF) photon beam of the upgraded c-series linear accelerator. Background:
      
    

    
      Varian Medical System clinacs with amorphous-silicon portal imager panel (aSi-1000) do not have PD for FFF beams. Recently, our c-series linear accelerator was upgraded to deliver 6MV FFF (6MVFFF) photon beam with the highest dose rate of 1400 monitor unit (MU)/min. The study, therefore, focuses on the commissioning and validation of PD for the 6MVFFF beam. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      An indirect method was implemented to predict the portal dose for FFF beam in Eclipse as the treatment planning system does not have direct prediction algorithm for FFF beam (version. 11). Dosimetrical characteristics of aSi-electronic portal imaging device (EPID) were evaluated for 6MVFFF beam and validation of PD for 6MVFFF beam was performed for open fields along with pretreatment quality assurance of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT), and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) techniques for 30 patients planned with 6MVFFF beam. Results:
      
    

    
      ASi-EPID saturates between 100 and 130 cm source to detector distance (SDD) for 6MVFFF beam and resolved at more than 140 cm SDD. The squared correlation coefficient (R2) for MU linearity was found to be 1 (R2 = 1), and instantaneous dose response linearity at different SDD's was found to be 0.999 (R2 = 0.999) for the 6MVFFF beam. Maximum gamma area index (GAI) for 3% dose difference and 3 mm distance-to-agreement criteria for IMRT, VMAT, and SRS/stereotactic radiotherapy plans was 97.9% ± 0.3%, 96.3% ± 0.5%, and 98.2% ± 0.2%, respectively. Conclusion:

      To evaluate the potential privileges of flattening filter-free (FFF) photon beams from Oncor® linac for 6 MV and 18 MV energies. Methods:
      
    

    
      A Monte Carlo (MC) model of Oncor® linac was built using BEAMnrc MCCode and verified by the measured data using 6 MV and 18 MV energies. A comprehensive set of data was also characterized for MC model of Oncor® machine running with and without flattening filter (FF) for 6 MV and 18 MV beams in six field sizes. The investigated characteristics included mean energy, energy spectrum, photon spatial fluence, superficial dose, percent depth dose (PDD), dose output, and out-of-field dose with two indexes of lateral dose profile and isodose curve at three depths.

1683,How best to use photons,"Strategies for collecting X-ray diffraction data have evolved alongside beamline hardware and detector developments. The traditional approaches for diffraction data collection have emphasised collecting data from noisy integrating detectors (i.e. film, image plates and CCD detectors). With fast pixel array detectors on stable beamlines, the limiting factor becomes the sample lifetime, and the question becomes one of how to expend the photons that your sample can diffract, i.e. as a smaller number of stronger measurements or a larger number of weaker data. This parameter space is explored via experiment and synthetic data treatment and advice is derived on how best to use the equipment on a modern beamline. Suggestions are also made on how to acquire data in a conservative manner if very little is known about the sample lifetime.","['1 Diamond Light Source, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus, Didcot, Oxfordshire OX11 0DE, UK.']","Graeme Winter, Richard J Gildea, Neil G Paterson, John Beale, Markus Gerstel, Danny Axford, Melanie Vollmar, Katherine E McAuley, Robin L Owen, Ralf Flaig, Alun W Ashton, David R Hall, ","Acta crystallographica.

1685,Overview of the current electrophysiology (EP) state of affairs in Russia,"Russia is the largest country in the world based on the landmass, covering more than one-eighth of the earth's inhabited area. Russia faces challenges in electrophysiology (EP) care including insufficient and uneven financing, complicated system for identifying optimal treatment for individual patients, relative paucity of reasonable educational and certification scope for electrophysiologists, suboptimal national statistical data gathering regarding heart rhythm disorders and EP devices in use, and weak networking of medical information. In comparison with the average level of EP utilization in ESC countries, Russia utilizes around 50% in pacemaker; 10% in ICD; 8% in cardiac resynchronization therapy; 55% in ablations; and 45% in AF ablations. As projected, Russia has the biggest unmet demand in EP procedures, so-called developmental potential in the European region. Nearly 37% of implanted single-chamber and 63% dual-chamber devices are manufactured outside of Russia. The price of the Russian devices is slightly (by 10-20%) lower than the one imported and they are readily provided for patients by the Russian Ministry of Health.

1686,Understanding the biology and advent of physics of cancer with perspicacity in current treatment therapy,"Cancer has become a key healthcare problem worldwide. The background of cancer research has brought the advent of cross-disciplinary collaborations that has enabled us to get an idea of the disease mechanisms at spatial and temporal scales. Understanding the combination of biology and physics of cancer presents a promising field of research with apprehensions in better clarity over both cellular and molecular mechanisms impacting cancer therapy. Investigation of cancer biology has provided a wealth of knowledge on cancer initiation and propagation and has provided newer treatment strategies in the fight against cancer. Understanding the physics of cancer provides wonderful set of equations that take advantage of mechanisms of force production, propagation by the cancer cells and mechanical properties of the tumor tissue. The spatial tissue arrangement in which the tumor growth occurs can be better understood with biophysics. Thus, the combination of biology and physics of cancer contributes crucially in impacting the correct treatment of cancer. The present review is aimed at providing an overview of regulatory networks, regulation of cell division and differentiation, the signal transduction pathways and integration of all sciences including physics, biology, and medicine which is very well needed to tackle the war against cancer and thus influence cancer therapy. These circuits will help us understand whether the therapy will work wonders or cause failure. As cancer is much more than a genetic disease, more insights into the malignancy with physical approaches are designed to use cancer therapy effectively.","[""1 Shobhaben Pratapbhai Patel School of Pharmacy & Technology Management, SVKM's NMIMS Deemed to be University, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India."", ""2 Shobhaben Pratapbhai Patel School of Pharmacy & Technology Management, SVKM's NMIMS Deemed to be University, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.

1687,High-Load Soft Grippers Based on Bionic Winding Effect,"The improvement of the load capacity of soft grippers has always been a challenge. To tackle this load capacity challenge, this work presents four novel types of high-load (HL) soft grippers that are bioinspired by bionic winding models. The winding models are found commonly in many animals and plants, where different winding patterns are used to grip different objects. Inspired by the winding models, we design four bionic winding structures that are driven by pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs), and then four HL soft grippers are formed out of the winding structures. The inner cavities of the HL soft grippers contract after the PAMs are inflated, which enables objects to be wrapped to achieve gripping. Compared with most existing soft grippers, the HL soft grippers have a higher load capacity, and they can also grip various objects that have different shapes and stiffnesses without damaging them. In addition, in man-machine collaboration, operators can be in direct contact with them without being hurt. Our study helps lay the foundation for engineered systems with bionic winding structures.","['1 1 Parallel Robot and Mechatronic System Laboratory of Hebei Province, Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, China.', '2 2 Key Laboratory of Advanced Forging and Stamping Technology and Science, Ministry of Education of China, Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, China.']","Haili Li, Jiantao Yao, Pan Zhou, Xinbo Chen, Yundou Xu, Yongsheng Zhao, ",Soft robotics,2019 Apr,gripping effect; high-load soft gripper; pneumatic artificial muscle; winding.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30650016
1688,Materials and Mechanisms of Photo-Assisted Chemical Reactions under Light and Dark Conditions: Can Day-Night Photocatalysis Be Achieved?,"The photoassisted catalytic reaction, conventionally known as photocatalysis, is expanding into the field of energy and environmental applications. It is widely known that the discovery of TiO2 -assisted photochemical reactions has led to several unique applications, such as degradation of pollutants in water and air, hydrogen production through water splitting, fuel conversion, cancer treatment, antibacterial activity, self-cleaning glasses, and concrete. These multifaceted applications of this phenomenon can be enriched and expanded further if this process is equipped with more tools and functions. The term ""photoassisted"" catalytic reactions clearly emphasizes that photons are required to activate the catalyst; this can be transcended even into the dark if electrons are stored in the material for the later use to continue the catalytic reactions in the absence of light. This can be achieved by equipping the photocatalyst with an electron-storage material to overcome current limitations in photoassisted catalytic reactions. In this context, this article sheds lights on the materials and mechanisms of photocatalytic reactions under light and dark conditions. The manifestation of such systems could be an unparalleled technology in the near future that could influence all spheres of the catalytic sciences.","['1 Department of Chemical Engineering, Laval University, Québec, G1V 0A6, Canada.']","M Sakar, Chinh-Chien Nguyen, Manh-Hiep Vu, Trong-On Do, ",ChemSusChem,2018,electron-storage materials; intercalations; materials science; photocatalysis; redox chemistry.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29316318

1690,On-Site Production of Cellulolytic Enzymes by the Sequential Cultivation Method,"The conversion of renewable lignocellulosic biomass into fuels, chemicals, and high-value materials using the biochemical platform has been considered the most sustainable alternative for the implementation of future biorefineries. However, the high cost of the cellulolytic enzymatic cocktails used in the saccharification step significantly affects the economics of industrial large-scale conversion processes. The on-site production of enzymes, integrated to the biorefinery plant, is being considered as a potential strategy that could be used to reduce costs. In such approach, the microbial production of enzymes can be carried out using the same lignocellulosic biomass as feedstock for fungal development and biofuels production. Most of the microbial cultivation processes for the production of industrial enzymes have been developed using the conventional submerged fermentation. Recently, a sequential solid-state followed by submerged fermentation has been described as a potential alternative cultivation method for cellulolytic enzymes production. This chapter presents the detailed procedure of the sequential cultivation method, which could be employed for the on-site production of the cellulolytic enzymes required to convert lignocellulosic biomass into simple sugars.","['1 Embrapa Instrumentation, São Carlos, SP, Brazil. cristiane.farinas@embrapa.br.', '2 Graduate Program of Chemical Engineering, Federal University of São Carlos, São Carlos, SP, Brazil. cristiane.farinas@embrapa.br.', '3 Embrapa Instrumentation, São Carlos, SP, Brazil.', '4 Graduate Program of Chemical Engineering, Federal University of São Carlos, São Carlos, SP, Brazil.']","Cristiane S Farinas, Camila Florencio, Alberto C Badino, ","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2018,Enzymatic hydrolysis; biorefinery; cellulases; enzymes; fermentation; on-site production.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29856060
1691,Phase Transitioning the Centrosome into a Microtubule Nucleator,"Centrosomes are self-assembling, micron-scale, nonmembrane bound organelles that nucleate microtubules (MTs) and organize the microtubule cytoskeleton of the cell. They orchestrate critical cellular processes such as ciliary-based motility, vesicle trafficking, and cell division. Much is known about the role of the centrosome in these contexts, but we have a less comprehensive understanding of how the centrosome assembles and generates microtubules. Studies over the past 10 years have fundamentally shifted our view of these processes. Subdiffraction imaging has probed the amorphous haze of material surrounding the core of the centrosome revealing a complex, hierarchically organized structure whose composition and size changes profoundly during the transition from interphase to mitosis. New biophysical insights into protein phase transitions, where a diffuse protein spontaneously separates into a locally concentrated, nonmembrane bounded compartment, have provided a fresh perspective into how the centrosome might rapidly condense from diffuse cytoplasmic components. In this Perspective, we focus on recent findings that identify several centrosomal proteins that undergo phase transitions. We discuss how to reconcile these results with the current model of the underlying organization of proteins in the centrosome. Furthermore, we reflect on how these findings impact our understanding of how the centrosome undergoes self-assembly and promotes MT nucleation.","['1 Department of Molecular Biology, Princeton University , Princeton, New Jersey 08544, United States.']","Michael J Rale, Rachel S Kadzik, Sabine Petry, ",Biochemistry,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29256606

The conductance measured between these two fixed points on the antibody does not change with the size of the electrode gap. A second conduction path is via one specific attachment to an epitope and a second nonspecific attachment to the surface of the antibody. In this case, the conductance does change with gap size, yielding an estimated electronic decay length >6 nm, long enough that it is not possible to distinguish between an exponential or a hyperbolic distance dependence.

      Numerous software utilities operating on mass spectrometry (MS) data are described in the literature and provide specific operations as building blocks for the assembly of on-purpose workflows. Working out which tools and combinations are applicable or optimal in practice is often hard. Thus researchers face difficulties in selecting practical and effective data analysis pipelines for a specific experimental design. Results:
      
    

    
      We provide a toolkit to support researchers in identifying, comparing and benchmarking multiple workflows from individual bioinformatics tools. Automated workflow composition is enabled by the tools' semantic annotation in terms of the EDAM ontology. To demonstrate the practical use of our framework, we created and evaluated a number of logically and semantically equivalent workflows for four use cases representing frequent tasks in MS-based proteomics.

The last decade has also seen significant progress in establishing accepted definitions, guidelines, and criteria for the analytical validation, acceptance and qualification of biomarkers. These advances have coincided with a decreased return on investment for pharmaceutical research and development and an increasing need for better early decision making tools. Empowering development teams with tools to measure a therapeutic interventions impact on disease state and progression, measure target engagement and to confirm predicted pharmacodynamic effects is critical to efficient data-driven decision making. Appropriate implementation of a biomarker or a combination of biomarkers can enhance understanding of a drugs mechanism, facilitate effective translation from the preclinical to clinical space, enable early proof of concept and dose selection, and increases the efficiency of drug development. Here we will provide descriptions of the different classes of biomarkers that have utility in the drug development process as well as review specific, protein-centric, mass spectrometry-based approaches for the discovery of biomarkers and development of targeted assays to measure these markers in a selective and analytically precise manner.","['1 Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics and Drug Metabolism, Merck Research Laboratories, West Point, PA, USA.', '2 Impact Analytical, Midland, MI, USA.', '3 Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics and Drug Metabolism, Merck Research Laboratories, West Point, PA, USA. daniel_spellman@merck.com.']","Michelle R Robinson, Ronald A Miller, Daniel S Spellman, ",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,2019,Biomarkers; Drug development; Mass spectrometry; Proteomics; Targeted quantitation.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31347063
1696,Improving large class performance and engagement through student-generated question banks,"Disciplines such as Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, which involve concepts not included in the high-school curriculum, are very challenging for many first year university students. These subjects are particularly difficult for students accustomed to surface learning strategies involving memorization and recall of facts, as a deeper understanding of the relationship between concepts is needed for successful transfer to related areas and subsequent study. In this article, we explore an activity in a very large first year Molecular Biology course, in which students create multiple-choice questions related to targeted learning outcomes, and then answer and evaluate one another's questions. This activity encompasses elements of both self- and peer-assessment and the generative tasks of creating questions and producing written feedback may contribute to a deeper understanding of the material. We make use of a free online platform to facilitate all aspects of the process and analyze the effect of student engagement with the task on overall course performance. When compared to previous semester's cohorts, we observe a pronounced improvement in class performance on exam questions targeting similar concepts to the student-generated questions. In addition, those students that engage to a greater extent with the activity perform significantly better on the targeted exam questions than those who are less active, yet all students perform similarly on a set of isolated control questions appearing on the same exam. © 2018 by The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 46:306-317, 2018.","['1 School of Life and Environmental Science, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.', '2 Department of Computer Science, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.']","Dale Hancock, Nicole Hare, Paul Denny, Gareth Denyer, ",Biochemistry and molecular biology education : a bimonthly publication of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,2018 Jul,PeerWise; biochemistry education; peer evaluation; student-authored multiple-choice questions.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29528559

Quantification of these proteins conventionally relies on antibody-based methods, i.e., enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), whose large-scale use is limited by availability, specificity, and affordability.Here, we describe an experimental and bioinformatics workflow to comprehensively quantify cellular protein secretion by mass spectrometry. Secreted proteins are collected in vitro or ex vivo, digested with proteases and the resulting peptide mixtures are analyzed in single liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) runs. Label-free quantification and bioinformatics analysis is conducted in the MaxQuant and Perseus computational environment.

Chronic recordings require a high signal-to-noise ratio that is stable for years. Current cortical devices generally fail within months to years after implantation. Development of novel devices to increase lifetime requires valid testing protocols and a knowledge of the critical parameters controlling electrophysiological performance. Here we present electrochemical and electrophysiological protocols for assessing implantable electrodes. Biological noise from neural recording has significant impact on signal-to-noise ratio. A recently developed surgical approach was utilised to reduce biological noise. This allowed correlation of electrochemical and electrophysiological behaviour. The impedance versus frequency of modified electrodes was non-linear. It was found that impedance at low frequencies was a stronger predictor of electrophysiological performance than the typically reported impedance at 1 kHz. Low frequency impedance is a function of electrode area, and a strong correlation of electrode area with electrophysiological response was also seen. Use of these standardised testing protocols will allow future devices to be compared before transfer to preclinical and clinical trials.","['1 ARC Centre of Excellence for Electromaterials Science, Intelligent Polymer Research Institute, University of Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia. alexrharris@gmail.com.']","Alexander R Harris, Ben J Allitt, Antonio G Paolini, ",The Analyst,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30888346

Eight quenching methods that used readily available organic solvents (methanol and ethanol) or cryoprotectants (glycerol and dimethyl sulfoxide) were evaluated quantitatively, and their effects on cell membrane integrity and metabolic inactivation were assessed by propidium iodide and energy charge assays, respectively. The combination of 20% methanol and 0.9% sodium chloride (-4 °C), with the lowest propidium iodide labelling rate of 3.06 ± 0.16% and the highest energy charge value of 0.849 ± 0.003, outperformed most of its counterparts and was adopted for further use. To retrieve most of the cellular metabolites, four extraction solvent systems, including methyl tert-butyl ether/methanol/water, methanol/water, acetonitrile/water and acetonitrile/methnol/water, were evaluated. And acetonitrile/methnol/water was found to be the most efficient one as, among other solvents, it yielded the highest metabolite abundances for most of the metabolites. Furthermore, the protocol was subjected to analytical validation using a series of selected representative metabolites and yielded a linear range of 0.00128-100 μg mL-1 with coefficients of 0.9953-0.9999 and recovery levels of 90%-110%.

1706,Interface-Targeting Strategy Enables Two-Photon Fluorescent Lipid Droplet Probes for High-Fidelity Imaging of Turbid Tissues and Detecting Fatty Liver,"Lipid droplets (LDs) with unique interfacial architecture not only play crucial roles in protecting a cell from lipotoxicity and lipoapoptosis but also closely relate with many diseases such as fatty liver and diabetes. Thus, as one of the important applied biomaterials, fluorescent probes with ultrahigh selectivity for in situ and high-fidelity imaging of LDs in living cells and tissues are critical to elucidate relevant physiological and pathological events as well as detect related diseases. However, available probes only utilizing LDs' waterless neutral cores but ignoring the unique phospholipid monolayer interfaces exhibit low selectivity. They cannot differentiate neutral cores of LDs from intracellular other lipophilic microenvironments, which results in extensively cloud-like background noise and severely limited their bioapplications. Herein, to design LD probes with ultrahigh selectivity, the exceptional interfacial architecture of LDs is considered adequately and thus an interface-targeting strategy is proposed for the first time. According to the novel strategy, we have developed two amphipathic fluorescent probes (N-Cy and N-Py) by introducing different cations into a lipophilic fluorophore (nitrobenzoxadiazole (NBD)). Consequently, their cationic moiety precisely locates the interfaces through electrostatic interaction and simultaneously NBD entirely embeds into the waterless core via hydrophobic interaction. Thus, high-fidelity and background-free fluorescence imaging of LDs are expectably realized in living cells in situ. Moreover, LDs in turbid tissues like skeletal muscle slices have been clearly imaged (up to 82 μm depth) by a two-photon microscope. Importantly, using N-Cy, we not only intuitively monitored the variations of LDs in number, size, and morphology but also clearly revealed their abnormity in hepatic tissues resulting from fatty liver. Therefore, these unique probes provide excellent imaging tools for elucidating LD-related physiological and pathological processes and the interface-targeting strategy possesses universal significance for designing probes with ultrahigh selectivity.","['1 Center of Bio & Micro/Nano Functional Materials, State Key Laboratory of Crystal Materials , Shandong University , Jinan 250100 , P.

This work aims to improve the quality of spectral X-ray CT image. Maximum a posteriori (MAP) expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is applied for reconstructing image-based weighting spectral X-ray CT images. A spectral X-ray CT system based on the cadmium zinc telluride photon counting detector and a fat cylinder phantom were simulated.

Compared with the prior image constrained compressed sensing (PICCS) method, the proposed method could reduce noise in the final weighting images by 36.5%, 44.6%, 27.3% and 18% at 2, 4, 6 and 9 energy bins, respectively, and improve the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) by 1.17 to 1.81. The simulation study also showed that comparing with the FBP and PICCS algorithms, image-based weighting imaging using MAP-EM statistical algorithm yielded significant improvement of the CNR and reduced the noise of the final weighting image.","['1 State Key Laboratory of Mechanics and Control of Mechanical Structures, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, P.

1709,Development of a sheathless CE-ESI-MS interface,"A sheath-flow interface is the most common ionization technique in CE-ESI-MS. However, this interface dilutes the analytes with the sheath liquid and decreases the sensitivity. In this study, we developed a sheathless CE-MS interface to improve sensitivity. The interface was fabricated by making a small crack approximately 2 cm from the end of a capillary column fixed on a plastic plate, and then covering the crack with a dialysis membrane to prevent metabolite loss during separation. A voltage for CE separation was applied between the capillary inlet and the buffer reservoir. Under optimum conditions, 52 cationic metabolite standards were separated and selectively detected using MS. With a pressure injection of 5 kPa for 15 s (ca. 1.4 nL), the detection limits for the tested compounds were between 0.06 and 1.7 μmol/L (S/N = 3). The method was applied to analysis of cationic metabolites extracted from a small number (12 000) of cancer cells, and the number of peaks detected was about 2.5 times higher than when using conventional sheath-flow CE-MS. Because the interface is easy to construct, it is cost-effective and can be adapted to any commercially available capillaries. This method is a powerful new tool for highly sensitive CE-MS-based metabolomic analysis.","['1 Institute for Advanced Biosciences, Keio University, Tsuruoka, Yamagata, Japan.']","Akiyoshi Hirayama, Hiroshi Abe, Nozomi Yamaguchi, Sho Tabata, Masaru Tomita, Tomoyoshi Soga, ",Electrophoresis,2018 Jun,Cancer cell; Capillary electrophoresis; Mass spectrometry; Metabolomics; Sheathless interface.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29493797
1710,The proteomic response of the reef coral Pocillopora acuta to experimentally elevated temperatures,"Although most reef-building corals live near the upper threshold of their thermotolerance, some scleractinians are resilient to temperature increases. For instance, Pocillopora acuta specimens from an upwelling habitat in Southern Taiwan survived a nine-month experimental exposure to 30°C, a temperature hypothesized to induce stress. To gain a greater understanding of the molecular pathways underlying such high-temperature acclimation, the protein profiles of experimental controls incubated at 27°C were compared to those of conspecific P. acuta specimens exposed to 30°C for two, four, or eight weeks, and differentially concentrated proteins (DCPs) were removed from the gels and sequenced with mass spectrometry. Sixty unique DCPs were uncovered across both eukaryotic compartments of the P. acuta-dinoflagellate (genus Symbiodinium) mutualism, and Symbiodinium were more responsive to high temperature at the protein-level than the coral hosts in which they resided at the two-week sampling time. Furthermore, proteins involved in the stress response were more likely to be documented at different cellular concentrations across temperature treatments in Symbiodinium, whereas the temperature-sensitive host coral proteome featured numerous proteins involved in cytoskeletal structure, immunity, and metabolism. These proteome-scale data suggest that the coral host and its intracellular dinoflagellates have differing strategies for acclimating to elevated temperatures.","['1 Khaled bin Sultan Living Oceans Foundation, Annapolis, MD, United States of America.', '2 Taiwan Coral Research Center, Checheng, Pingtung, Taiwan.', '3 Department of Biochemistry, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', '4 Center for Research Resources and Development, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', '5 Department of Marine Biotechnology and Resources, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', '6 Graduate Institute of Marine Biotechnology, National Dong-Hwa University, Checheng, Pingtung, Taiwan.']","Anderson B Mayfield, Yi-Jyun Chen, Chi-Yu Lu, Chii-Shiarng Chen, ",PloS one,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29385204
1711,Comparison of venous and fingertip plasma using non-targeted proteomics and metabolomics,"Blood tests, which are used to evaluate health status, are relatively non-invasive and provide a great deal of health-related information. Blood is usually collected using a standard venous blood sampling protocol, but it is possible to collect blood from a subject's fingertip, and previous studies have investigated whether fingertip-derived blood can be used for various blood tests. In this study, the proteomes and metabolomes of venous and fingertip plasma were analyzed using non-targeted proteomics and metabolomics, respectively. In proteomics, the levels of 523 proteins were compared between venous and fingertip plasma. The correlation coefficient (r) for the relationship between protein levels of venous and fingertip plasma was 0.9999. Some proteins had high fingertip to venous plasma level ratios (finger:venous ratios), whereas others had low finger:venous ratios, and the mean±standard deviation (SD) finger:venous ratio was 0.994 ± 0.304. In metabolomics, 40, 33, and 216 cationic metabolites, anionic metabolites, and lipids, respectively, were detected in venous plasma, and the equivalent figures for fingertip plasma were 40, 35, and 216, respectively. Regarding the correlations between metabolite levels in venous and fingertip plasma, the correlation coefficients (r) for cationic metabolites, anionic metabolites, and lipids were 0.9952, 0.9699, and 0.9980, respectively. The mean±SD finger:venous ratio was 1.19 ± 0.584 for cationic metabolites, 1.23 ± 0.548 for anionic metabolites, and 1.00 ± 0.245 for lipids. Our study suggests that it might be possible to use fingertip plasma to measure plasma protein and metabolite levels, and will contribute to development of a fingertip blood sampling procedure for measuring blood biomarker levels.","['1 Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Japan.

1712,Habitual higher order aberrations affect Landolt but not Vernier acuity,"To assess whether the eye's optical imperfections are relevant for hyperacute vision, we measured ocular wave aberrations, visual hyperacuity, and acuity thresholds in 31 eyes of young adults. Although there was a significant positive correlation between the subjects' performance in Vernier- and Landolt-optotype acuity tasks, we found clear differences in how far both acuity measures correlate with the eyes' optics. Landolt acuity thresholds were significantly better in eyes with low higher order aberrations and high visual Strehl ratios (r2 = 0.22, p = 0.009), and significantly positively correlated with axial length (r2 = 0.15, p = 0.03). A retinal image quality metric, calculated as two-dimensional correlation between perfect and actual retinal image, was also correlated with Landolt acuity thresholds (r2 = 0.27, p = 0.003). No such correlations were found with Vernier acuity performance (r2 < 0.03, p > 0.3). Based on these results, hyperacuity thresholds are, contrary to resolution acuity, not affected by higher order aberrations of the eye.","['1 Department of Ophthalmology, University of Bonn, Germany.', '2 Department of Neurobiology, University of Bielefeld, Germany.', '3 Department of Ophthalmology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', '4 Eye Center, Medical Center-University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Germany.', '5 University Eye Clinic Maastricht, The Netherlands.']","Jenny L Reiniger, Anne C Lobecke, Ramkumar Sabesan, Michael Bach, Frenne Verbakel, John de Brabander, Frank G Holz, Tos T J M Berendschot, Wolf M Harmening, ",Journal of vision,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31100127

1714,Application of Microelectrode Array Approaches to Neurotoxicity Testing and Screening,"Neurotoxicity can be defined by the ability of a drug or chemical to alter the physiology, biochemistry, or structure of the nervous system in a manner that may negatively impact the health or function of the individual. Electrophysiological approaches have been utilized to study the mechanisms underlying neurotoxic actions of drugs and chemicals for over 50 years, and in more recent decades, high-throughput patch-clamp approaches have been utilized by the pharmaceutical industry for drug development. The use of microelectrode array recordings to study neural network electrophysiology is a relatively newer approach, with commercially available systems becoming available only in the early 2000s. However, MEAs have been rapidly adopted as a useful approach for neurotoxicity testing. In this chapter, I will review the use of MEA approaches as they have been applied to the field of neurotoxicity testing, especially as they have been applied to the need to screen large numbers of chemicals for neurotoxicity and developmental neurotoxicity. In addition, I will also identify challenges for the field that when addressed will improve the utility of MEA approaches for toxicity testing.","['1 Integrated Systems Toxicology Division, National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (NHEERL), US EPA, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA. shafer.tim@epa.gov.']","Timothy J Shafer, ",Advances in neurobiology,2019,Developmental neurotoxicity; Neurotoxicity; Screening.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31073941

Photon-counting CT uses new energy-resolving x-ray detectors, with mechanisms that differ substantially from those of conventional energy-integrating detectors. Photon-counting CT detectors count the number of incoming photons and measure photon energy. This technique results in higher contrast-to-noise ratio, improved spatial resolution, and optimized spectral imaging. Photon-counting CT can reduce radiation exposure, reconstruct images at a higher resolution, correct beam-hardening artifacts, optimize the use of contrast agents, and create opportunities for quantitative imaging relative to current CT technology. In this review, the authors will explain the technical principles of photon-counting CT in nonmathematical terms for radiologists and clinicians. Following a general overview of the current status of photon-counting CT, they will explain potential clinical applications of this technology.","['1 From the Department of Radiology (M.J.W., M.P., N.J.P., D.F.) and Stanford Cardiovascular Institute (D.F.), Stanford University School of Medicine, 300 Pasteur Dr, S-072, Stanford, CA 94305-5105; Department of Radiology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, the Netherlands (M.J.W.); Departments of Bioengineering (M.P., N.J.P.) and Electrical Engineering (N.J.P.), Stanford University, Stanford, Calif; Department of Radiology and Department of Imaging Sciences and Biomedical Informatics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Ga (A.P.).']","Martin J Willemink, Mats Persson, Amir Pourmorteza, Norbert J Pelc, Dominik Fleischmann, ",Radiology,2018 Nov,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30179101

A critical explanatory gap lies in our mechanistic understanding of how systems-level neuroimaging biomarkers emerge from underlying synaptic-level perturbations associated with a disease state. We describe an emerging computational psychiatry approach leveraging biophysically based computational models of large-scale brain dynamics and their potential integration with clinical and pharmacological neuroimaging. In particular, we focus on neural circuit models, which describe how patterns of functional connectivity observed in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging emerge from neural dynamics shaped by inter-areal interactions through underlying structural connectivity defining long-range projections. We highlight the importance of local circuit physiological dynamics, in combination with structural connectivity, in shaping the emergent functional connectivity. Furthermore, heterogeneity of local circuit properties across brain areas, which impacts large-scale dynamics, may be critical for modeling whole-brain phenomena and alterations in psychiatric disorders and pharmacological manipulation. Finally, we discuss important directions for future model development and biophysical extensions, which will expand their utility to link clinical neuroimaging to neurobiological mechanisms.","['1 Department of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.

1718,Monte carlo study of organ doses and related risk for cancer in Tanzania from scattered photons in cervical radiation treatment involving Co-60 source,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      The present work aimed to evaluate organ doses and related risk for cancer from external beam radiation treatment (EBRT) and high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy (BT) involving Co-60 source for patients with cervical carcinoma in Tanzania based on Monte Carlo methods and to evaluate the secondary cancer risks in their lifetime. Methods:
      
    

    
      EBRT and HDR-BR were modelled by using the MCNPX Monte Carlo (MC) code. The MC simulations were performed by using validated models and isocentric irradiation of an adult female computational phantom. The organ doses and cancer risks estimates were obtained. Results:
      
    

    
      The highest absorbed doses of 6.98 × 10-2 and 5.74 × 10-2 Sv/Gy were recorded in the bladder for BT and EBRT. The higher risk was found for colon at 1.06 × 10-3 in the HDR-BT and 9.75 × 10-5 in the EBRT per 100,000 population at exposure age of 35 years than in the other organs. The risk magnitude decreased with increasing age at exposure. In general, the secondary cancer risks in all sites considered from EBRT and HDR-BR for cervical cancer patient were lower than the baseline risks. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The chances of developing secondary cancer take years following radiation therapy are extremely low, but the results of present study can support to establish a future database on secondary cancer risks involving radiation therapy in patients with cervical cancer by using HDR-BR and EBRT with Co-60 source in Tanzania and other developing countries.","['1 Department of Engineering and Applied Physics, School of Physical Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui Province 230027, PR China; Ionizing Radiation Department, Tanzania Atomic Energy Commission, 23114 Block J Njiro, PO BOX 743, Arusha, United Republic of Tanzania.

This is particularly important for samples, which need to be compared without the availability of replicates and thus cannot be studied using differential gel electrophoresis (DIGE). CoFGE corrects for gel-to-gel variability by co-running with the sample proteome a standardized marker grid of 80-100 nodes, which is formed by a set of purified proteins. Differentiation of reference and analyte is possible by the use of two fluorescent dyes. Variations in the y-dimension (molecular weight) are corrected by the marker grid. For the optional control of the x-dimension (pI), azo dyes can be used. Experiments are possible in both vertical and horizontal (h) electrophoresis devices, but hCoFGE is much easier to perform.

1720,pseudoQC: A Regression-Based Simulation Software for Correction and Normalization of Complex Metabolomics and Proteomics Datasets,"Various types of unwanted and uncontrollable signal variations in MS-based metabolomics and proteomics datasets severely disturb the accuracies of metabolite and protein profiling. Therefore, pooled quality control (QC) samples are often employed in quality management processes, which are indispensable to the success of metabolomics and proteomics experiments, especially in high-throughput cases and long-term projects. However, data consistency and QC sample stability are still difficult to guarantee because of the experimental operation complexity and differences between experimenters. To make things worse, numerous proteomics projects do not take QC samples into consideration at the beginning of experimental design. Herein, a powerful and interactive web-based software, named pseudoQC, is presented to simulate QC sample data for actual metabolomics and proteomics datasets using four different machine learning-based regression methods. The simulated data are used for correction and normalization of the two published datasets, and the obtained results suggest that nonlinear regression methods perform better than linear ones. Additionally, the above software is available as a web-based graphical user interface and can be utilized by scientists without a bioinformatics background. pseudoQC is open-source software and freely available at https://www.omicsolution.org/wukong/pseudoQC/.","['1 West China-Washington Mitochondria and Metabolism Research Center, Key Lab of Transplant Engineering and Immunology, MOH, West China Hospital, Keyuan South Road, Hi-Tech Zone, Chengdu, 610041, China.']","Shisheng Wang, Hao Yang, ",Proteomics,2019 Oct,machine learning; metabolomics; proteomics; pseudo-quality control; regression.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31474000

It is possible to determine meaningful thermostability parameters from the routinely acquired data through a straightforward method that is not only more informative but also provides a means to compare thermostability of enzymes from different sources. Here, we describe a simple, effective, and economical way to determine enzyme thermostability. In our opinion, including this method in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology curricula will encourage students to include thermostability analysis in their future work, leading to a more meaningful approach to evaluate and compare enzymes.

1724,Modelling variable proton relative biological effectiveness for treatment planning,"Dose in proton radiotherapy is generally prescribed by scaling the physical proton dose by a constant value of 1.1. Relative biological effectiveness (RBE) is defined as the ratio of doses required by two radiation modalities to cause the same level of biological effect. The adoption of an RBE of 1.1. assumes that the biological efficacy of protons is similar to photons, allowing decades of clinical dose prescriptions from photon treatments and protocols to be utilized in proton therapy. There is, however, emerging experimental evidence that indicates that proton RBE varies based on technical, tissue and patient factors. The notion that a single scaling factor may be used to equate the effects of photons and protons across all biological endpoints and doses is too simplistic and raises concern for treatment planning decisions. Here, we review the models that have been developed to better predict RBE variations in tissue based on experimental data as well as using a mechanistic approach.","['1 Department of Radiation Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital & Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']","Aimee McNamara L, Henning Willers, Harald Paganetti, ",The British journal of radiology,2020 Mar,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31738081

1729,How to Identify the Research Abilities That Instructors Anticipate Students Will Develop in a Biochemistry Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE),"Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) have been described in a range of educational contexts. Although various anticipated learning outcomes (ALOs) have been proposed, processes for identifying them may not be rigorous or well documented, which can lead to inappropriate assessment and speculation about what students actually learn from CUREs. In this essay, we offer a user-friendly and rigorous approach based on evidence and an easy process to identify ALOs, namely, a five-step Process for Identifying Course-Based Undergraduate Research Abilities (PICURA), consisting of a content analysis, an open-ended survey, an interview, an alignment check, and a two-tiered Likert survey. The development of PICURA was guided by four criteria: 1) the process is iterative, 2) the overall process gives more insight than individual data sources, 3) the steps of the process allow for consensus across the data sources, and 4) the process allows for prioritization of the identified abilities. To address these criteria, we collected data from 10 participants in a multi-institutional biochemistry CURE. In this essay, we use two selected research abilities to illustrate how PICURA was used to identify and prioritize such abilities. PICURA could be applied to other CUREs in other contexts.","['1 Department of Chemistry, Purdue University, West\xa0-Lafayette, IN 47906.', '2 Department of Biological Sciences, Purdue University, West\xa0-Lafayette, IN 47906.']","Stefan Mark Irby, Nancy J Pelaez, Trevor R Anderson, ",CBE life sciences education,2018 Jun,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29749847

Here we review the underpinnings of this progress, including methods for more efficient conformational sampling, accuracy of the physical models used, and theoretical approaches to integrate experiments and simulations. These developments are enabling detailed studies of complex biomolecular assemblies.","['1 Structural Biology and NMR Laboratory, Linderstrøm-Lang Centre for Protein Science and Integrative Structural Biology at University of Copenhagen (ISBUC), Department of Biology, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', '2 Structural Biology and NMR Laboratory, Linderstrøm-Lang Centre for Protein Science and Integrative Structural Biology at University of Copenhagen (ISBUC), Department of Biology, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark. lindorff@bio.ku.dk.']","Sandro Bottaro, Kresten Lindorff-Larsen, ","Science (New York, N.Y.)",2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30049874
1731,Current trends to comprehend lipid metabolism in diatoms,"Diatoms are the most dominant phytoplankton species in oceans and they continue to receive a great deal of attention because of their significant contributions in ecosystems and the environment. Due to triacylglycerol (TAG) profiles that are abundant in medium-chain fatty acids, diatoms have emerged to be better feed stocks for biofuel production, in comparison to the commonly studied green microalgal species (chlorophytes). Importantly, diatoms are also known for their high levels of the essential ω3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and are considered to be a promising alternative source of these components. The two most commonly exploited diatoms include Thalassiosira pseudonana and Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Although obvious similarities between diatoms and chlorophytes exist, there are some substantial differences in their lipid metabolism. This review provides an overview on lipid metabolism in diatoms, with P. tricornutum as the most explored model. Special emphasis is placed on the synthesis and incorporation of very long chain ω3 fatty acids into lipids. Furthermore, current approaches including genetic engineering and biotechnological methods aimed at improving and maximizing lipid production in P. tricornutum are also discussed.","['1 University of Goettingen, Albrecht-von-Haller-Institute for Plant Sciences, Department of Plant Biochemistry, 37077 Goettingen, Germany.

Therefore, we developed an evidence-based instructional design to investigate the usefulness of test-enhanced learning within a flipped/inverted classroom approach. Materials and Methods: We developed two modes of learning material for the self-study phase of a flipped classroom for 139 students: in addition to educational films, one group of students received a reader and another group received multiple-choice questions that corresponded to the reader in content and length. An assessment of the content of the learning material was conducted at the subsequent on-site phase. Also, ratings about students' perceptions of the additional learning material were gathered. Results: At the assessment, students that prepared with films and multiple-choice questions outperformed students that prepared with films and the reader. Furthermore, students perceived the multiple-choice questions as more helpful, more motivating and felt better prepared for the assessment than students that used the reader. Conclusions: This study shows that test-enhanced learning can be utilized to promote students' learning within the self-study phase of a flipped classroom. Not only assessment scores are positively affected but also the motivation to learn and preparedness towards an assessment.","['1 Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical Faculty, Ulm University , Ulm , Germany.']","Achim Schneider, Michael Kühl, Susanne J Kühl, ",Medical teacher,2019 Nov,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31282246

The quantification of these errors supports correct interpretation of data, thus supporting scientific progress. Absence of information regarding reliability and accuracy can slow scientific progress, and can lead to a reproducibility crisis. Here we consider both measurement theory and plant biomechanics literature. Drawing from measurement theory literature, we review techniques for assessing both the accuracy and uncertainty of a measurement process. In our survey of plant biomechanics literature, we found that direct assessment of measurement accuracy and uncertainty is not yet common.

Rather than giving an exhaustive description of the many techniques currently available, we show the usefulness of a representative selection of techniques in the functional and morphological evaluation of the skin barrier. Furthermore, we introduce human minimally invasive skin challenging models as a means to study the mechanisms regulating skin homoeostasis and disease and subsequently show how biophysical analysis techniques can be combined with these in vivo skin challenging models in the functional and morphological evaluation of the skin barrier in healthy human skin. We are convinced that the widespread application of biophysical analysis techniques in dermatological practice and in cosmetic sciences will prove invaluable in offering personalized and noninvasive skin treatment solutions. Furthermore, combining the human in vivo challenging models with these novel noninvasive techniques will provide valuable methodology and tools for detailed characterization of the skin barrier in health and disease.","['1 Department of Dermatology, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']","Piet E J van Erp, Malou Peppelman, Denise Falcone, ",Experimental dermatology,2018 Aug,biophysical analysis techniques; human in vivo challenging models; noninvasive; skin barrier characterization; skin disease.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30019358

1743,Lipidomic and biophysical homeostasis of mammalian membranes counteracts dietary lipid perturbations to maintain cellular fitness,"Proper membrane physiology requires maintenance of biophysical properties, which must be buffered from external perturbations. While homeostatic adaptation of membrane fluidity to temperature variation is a ubiquitous feature of ectothermic organisms, such responsive membrane adaptation to external inputs has not been directly observed in mammals. Here, we report that challenging mammalian membranes by dietary lipids leads to robust lipidomic remodeling to preserve membrane physical properties. Specifically, exogenous polyunsaturated fatty acids are rapidly incorporated into membrane lipids, inducing a reduction in membrane packing. These effects are rapidly compensated both in culture and in vivo by lipidome-wide remodeling, most notably upregulation of saturated lipids and cholesterol, resulting in recovery of membrane packing and permeability. Abrogation of this response results in cytotoxicity when membrane homeostasis is challenged by dietary lipids. These results reveal an essential mammalian mechanism for membrane homeostasis wherein lipidome remodeling in response to dietary lipid inputs preserves functional membrane phenotypes.","['1 Department of Integrative Biology & Pharmacology, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, USA. kandice.r.levental@uth.tmc.edu.', '2 Department of Integrative Biology & Pharmacology, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, USA.', '3 Program in Integrative Nutrition & Complex Diseases and Department of Nutrition, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA.', '4 Department of Medical Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, Medical Faculty, Saarland University, Homburg, Germany.', '5 Department of Integrative Biology & Pharmacology, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, USA. ilya.levental@uth.tmc.edu.']","Kandice R Levental, Eric Malmberg, Jessica L Symons, Yang-Yi Fan, Robert S Chapkin, Robert Ernst, Ilya Levental, ",Nature communications,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32165635

However, important hurdles to widespread application still exist; for example, the vast majority of demonstrations are in nonpolar solvents, limiting applications. Furthermore, the necessary high concentrations of dyes limit optical penetration depth. Efforts toward aqueous solutions utilizing micelles and other nanoencapsulants have been limited by poor efficiencies or scatter from the nanoparticles. Here, we demonstrate a facile micellular fabrication method that drives a high boiling point solvent into the core of a block copolymer micelle, greatly reducing molecular aggregation.

Linear ""developmental pathways"" are often inadequate explanations for dynamic large-scale pattern regulation, even when they accurately capture relationships between molecular components. Biophysical and computational aspects of collective cell activity toward a target morphology reveal interesting aspects of causation in biology. This is critical not only for unraveling evolutionary and developmental events, but also for the design of effective strategies for biomedical intervention. Bioelectrical controls of growth and form, including stochastic behavior in such circuits, highlight the need for the formulation of nuanced views of pathways, drivers of system-level outcomes, and modularity, borrowing from concepts in related disciplines such as cybernetics, control theory, computational neuroscience, and information theory. This approach has numerous practical implications for basic research and for applications in regenerative medicine and synthetic bioengineering.","['1 Allen Discovery Center at Tufts University, Medford, MA, 02155, USA.', '2 Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, Harvard University, Boston, MA, 02115, USA.']","Michael Levin, ","BioEssays : news and reviews in molecular, cellular and developmental biology",2020 Feb,bioelectricity; causation; development; embryos; pathways; regeneration.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31994772

We provide an overview for the discovery and physiological relevance of the two known Gβγ-mediated mechanisms for presynaptic inhibition: first, the action of Gβγ on voltage-gated calcium channels to inhibit calcium influx to the presynaptic active zone and, second, the direct binding of Gβγ to the SNARE complex to displace synaptotagmin downstream of calcium entry, which has been demonstrated to be important in neurons and secretory cells.

1749,Interpreting the dimensions of neural feature representations revealed by dimensionality reduction,"Recent progress in understanding the structure of neural representations in the cerebral cortex has centred around the application of multivariate classification analyses to measurements of brain activity. These analyses have proved a sensitive test of whether given brain regions provide information about specific perceptual or cognitive processes. An exciting extension of this approach is to infer the structure of this information, thereby drawing conclusions about the underlying neural representational space. These approaches rely on exploratory data-driven dimensionality reduction to extract the natural dimensions of neural spaces, including natural visual object and scene representations, semantic and conceptual knowledge, and working memory. However, the efficacy of these exploratory methods is unknown, because they have only been applied to representations in brain areas for which we have little or no secondary knowledge. One of the best-understood areas of the cerebral cortex is area MT of primate visual cortex, which is known to be important in motion analysis. To assess the effectiveness of dimensionality reduction for recovering neural representational space we applied several dimensionality reduction methods to multielectrode measurements of spiking activity obtained from area MT of marmoset monkeys, made while systematically varying the motion direction and speed of moving stimuli. Despite robust tuning at individual electrodes, and high classifier performance, dimensionality reduction rarely revealed dimensions for direction and speed. We use this example to illustrate important limitations of these analyses, and suggest a framework for how to best apply such methods to data where the structure of the neural representation is unknown.","['1 McGill Vision Research, Dept of Ophthalmology, McGill University, Montreal, QC, H3G 1A4, Canada; School of Psychology, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, 2006, Australia; ARC Centre of Excellence in Cognition and Its Disorders (CCD), Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW, 2109, Australia.

1754,On the choice of metric in gradient-based theories of brain function,"This is a PLOS Computational Biology Education paper. The idea that the brain functions so as to minimize certain costs pervades theoretical neuroscience. Because a cost function by itself does not predict how the brain finds its minima, additional assumptions about the optimization method need to be made to predict the dynamics of physiological quantities. In this context, steepest descent (also called gradient descent) is often suggested as an algorithmic principle of optimization potentially implemented by the brain. In practice, researchers often consider the vector of partial derivatives as the gradient. However, the definition of the gradient and the notion of a steepest direction depend on the choice of a metric. Because the choice of the metric involves a large number of degrees of freedom, the predictive power of models that are based on gradient descent must be called into question, unless there are strong constraints on the choice of the metric. Here, we provide a didactic review of the mathematics of gradient descent, illustrate common pitfalls of using gradient descent as a principle of brain function with examples from the literature, and propose ways forward to constrain the metric.","['1 Department of Physiology, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', '2 Institute of Neuroinformatics and Neuroscience Center Zurich, University Zurich and ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', '3 School of Computer and Communication Sciences and Brain Mind Institute, School of Life Sciences, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.']","Simone Carlo Surace, Jean-Pascal Pfister, Wulfram Gerstner, Johanni Brea, ",PLoS computational biology,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32271761

1757,Mind the last spike - firing rate models for mesoscopic populations of spiking neurons,"The dominant modeling framework for understanding cortical computations are heuristic firing rate models. Despite their success, these models fall short to capture spike synchronization effects, to link to biophysical parameters and to describe finite-size fluctuations. In this opinion article, we propose that the refractory density method (RDM), also known as age-structured population dynamics or quasi-renewal theory, yields a powerful theoretical framework to build rate-based models for mesoscopic neural populations from realistic neuron dynamics at the microscopic level. We review recent advances achieved by the RDM to obtain efficient population density equations for networks of generalized integrate-and-fire (GIF) neurons - a class of neuron models that has been successfully fitted to various cell types. The theory not only predicts the nonstationary dynamics of large populations of neurons but also permits an extension to finite-size populations and a systematic reduction to low-dimensional rate dynamics. The new types of rate models will allow a re-examination of models of cortical computations under biological constraints.","['1 Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience, 10115 Berlin, Germany; Institut für Mathematik, Technische Universität Berlin, 10623 Berlin, Germany.

      Multi-analyte assays with algorithmic analyses (MAAAs) use combinations of circulating and clinical markers including omics-based sources for diagnostic and/or prognostic purposes. Assessing MAAAs is challenging under existing health technology assessment (HTA) methods or practices. We undertook a scoping review to explore the HTA methods used for MAAAs to identify the criteria used for clinical research and reimbursement purposes. Methods:
      
    

    
      This review included only non-companion (stand-alone) tests that are actionable and that have been evaluated by leading HTA or insurer/reimbursement bodies up to September 2017. Results:
      
    

    
      Twenty-five reports and articles evaluating seventeen MAAAs were examined, most of which have been developed in oncology. The two main models used were the EUnetHTA Core model and the Evaluation of Genomic Applications in Practice and Prevention ACCE framework. Clinical validity and utility criteria were used, as were economic, ethical, legal, and social aspects. Economic evidence on MAAAs was scarce, and there is no consensus on whether the perspectives used are sufficiently broad to include all relevant stakeholders. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Clinical utility and efficiency were the most used criteria, with stronger evidence needed linking the use of the algorithm with the clinical outcomes in real-life practice. HTA bodies must as well consider questions related to the analytical validity of MAAAs or with organizational aspects. The two main models, the EUnetHTA Core model and the ACCE framework, could be adapted to the assessment of MAAAs.","['1 Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris,URC-écoalexandre.barna@gmail.com.', '2 Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris,URC-éco.', '3 Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris.', '4 Syddansk Universitet Det Sundhedsvidenskabelige Fakultet.']","Alexandre Barna, Teresita M Cruz-Sanchez, Karen Berg Brigham, Cong-Tri Thuong, Finn Boerlum Kristensen, Isabelle Durand-Zaleski, ",International journal of technology assessment in health care,2018 Jan,Assessment and regulation; Biomarkers; Personalized medicine; Reimbursement policy.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30136642
1759,Generative Biophysical Modeling of Dynamical Networks in the Olfactory System,"Generative models are computational models designed to generate appropriate values for all of their embedded variables, thereby simulating the response properties of a complex system based on the coordinated interactions of a multitude of physical mechanisms. In systems neuroscience, generative models are generally biophysically based compartmental models of neurons and networks that are explicitly multiscale, being constrained by experimental data at multiple levels of organization from cellular membrane properties to large-scale network dynamics. As such, they are able to explain the origins of emergent properties in complex systems, and serve as tests of sufficiency and as quantitative instantiations of working hypotheses that may be too complex to simply intuit. Moreover, when adequately constrained, generative biophysical models are able to predict novel experimental outcomes, and consequently are powerful tools for experimental design. We here outline a general strategy for the iterative design and implementation of generative, multiscale biophysical models of neural systems. We illustrate this process using our ongoing, iteratively developing model of the mammalian olfactory bulb. Because the olfactory bulb exhibits diverse and interesting properties at multiple scales of organization, it is an attractive system in which to illustrate the value of generative modeling across scales.","['1 Department of Psychology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA.', '2 Department of Psychiatry, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.', '3 Department of Psychology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA. tac29@cornell.edu.']","Guoshi Li, Thomas A Cleland, ","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2018,Compartmental model; Gamma oscillations; Generative model; Network; Olfactory bulb; Subthreshold oscillations.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29884952

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has different paths to market approval depending on the intended use and the associated risks of the device. The European Union and Japan have device approval processes that have many similarities as well as differences to the US regulatory system. This paper describes some of the history and background of the US device approval process with an emphasis on EP devices. It provides an overview of the different regulatory pathways in the USA that are currently being utilized and contrasts them to the procedures often used in the European Union and in Japan.

1762,A reflection on the role of ICP-MS in proteomics: Update and future perspective,"Mass spectrometry is the technique of reference for the identification and quantification of proteins. Whereas ESI and MALDI ionization sources are inherently not quantitative being highly influenced by the chemical nature of the analyte and the matrix, ICP-MS uses a hard ionization source that destroys proteins into its atoms and measures the elemental signal, which is independent of its chemical environment. As a consequence, ICP-MS turns up as an excellent technique for the screening, mapping and quantification of peptides and proteins in a sample through elemental detection (any element but C, H, N, or O) once they have been previously separated by chromatography. In this time, great efforts have been put in developing instrumentation and new methodologies that enable a better, more efficient, and more useful analysis of proteins with ICP-MS. Moreover, quantitative capabilities but lack of molecular information of ICP has led to a synergic relationship both with identifying capabilities of ESI-MS, or the use of protein-specific antibodies carrying an elemental label. JOURNAL SIGNIFICANCE: We are delighted to participate in this special issue and have the chance to congratulate Journal of Proteomics for its 10th Anniversary, and wish for many further successful anniversaries. During this last decade, Journal of Proteomics has been a clear promotor of works integrating ICP-MS for proteomics analysis. In fact, already in 2009, a review was published by invitation of the editor in chief focused on the established and potential role of ICP-MS in different areas of the proteomics analysis at the time: ""The emerging role of ICP-MS in proteomics"" [1]. Even though ICP-MS is not fully known or acknowledged in the proteomics world yet, its impact was significant as demonstrated by the really high interest in such publication (over 150 citations). Since then, several excellent papers relating to ICP-MS applications in proteomics have been published in this journal. Following the trend, we expect through this personal view of the current standing of ICP-MS in proteomics to enlighten the readers of Journal of Proteomics with a vision of the full present and future potential of ICP-MS in proteomics.","['1 Department of Physical and Analytical Chemistry, University of Oviedo, Spain.', '2 Department of Physical and Analytical Chemistry, University of Oviedo, Spain.

1763,Reliable autapse formation using the single-cell patterning method,"Auto neuronal synapses, or autapses, are aberrant structures where the synaptic contact of a neuron forms onto its own branch. The functions of autapses, however, remain unknown. Here, we introduce a simple patterning method for capturing a single-cell, in which we maintained the isolated cell until it reached maturity, and developed arrays of autapses for electrophysiological analysis using multi-electrode arrays (MEA). The pattern arrays were formed by selective patterning of poly-L-lysine and various cell repellent materials. We tested the efficiency of single neuron pattern formed according to materials and pattern dimensions. Autapse formation was verified by immunostaining synaptic markers and physiological measurements via recordings from MEA. The results demonstrated that our multiscale patterning method increased the number of autapses consisting of a single neuron, which matured to connect onto themselves. The proposed patterning method (4.06 ± 0.33 isolated single-cells mm-2) is at least twelve times more efficient and productive than the spray method (0.31 ± 0.10 isolated single-cells mm-2). The spontaneous activity of a single neuron on the patterned MEA occured after 11 d in vitro. The single neuron activity consisted of bursts followed by spike trains (the burst rate was 2.56 min-1). This indicates that our method could be used for electrophysiological analysis, including MEA.","['1 Division of WCU (World Class University) Multiscale Mechanical Design, School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']","Seokyoung Bang, Byung-Ju Lee, Seung-Ryeol Lee, Sangcheol Na, Jae Myung Jang, Myeongwoo Kang, Sung-Yon Kim, Dal-Hee Min, Joon Myong Song, Won-Kyung Ho, Noo Li Jeon, ",Biofabrication,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30421727
1764,Sample Entropy Analysis of Noisy Atrial Electrograms during Atrial Fibrillation,"Most cardiac arrhythmias can be classified as atrial flutter, focal atrial tachycardia, or atrial fibrillation. They have been usually treated using drugs, but catheter ablation has proven more effective. This is an invasive method devised to destroy the heart tissue that disturbs correct heart rhythm. In order to accurately localise the focus of this disturbance, the acquisition and processing of atrial electrograms form the usual mapping technique. They can be single potentials, double potentials, or complex fractionated atrial electrogram (CFAE) potentials, and last ones are the most effective targets for ablation. The electrophysiological substrate is then localised by a suitable signal processing method. Sample Entropy is a statistic scarcely applied to electrograms but can arguably become a powerful tool to analyse these time series, supported by its results in other similar biomedical applications. However, the lack of an analysis of its dependence on the perturbations usually found in electrogram data, such as missing samples or spikes, is even more marked. This paper applied SampEn to the segmentation between non-CFAE and CFAE records and assessed its class segmentation power loss at different levels of these perturbations. The results confirmed that SampEn was able to significantly distinguish between non-CFAE and CFAE records, even under very unfavourable conditions, such as 50% of missing data or 10% of spikes.","['1 Technological Institute of Informatics, Universitat Politècnica de València, Alcoi Campus, Plaza Ferrándiz y Carbonell 2, Alcoi, Spain.', '2 Department of Cybernetics, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague, Czech Republic.', '3 Czech Institute of Informatics, Robotics and Cybernetics, Czech Technical University in Prague, Czech Republic.']","Eva María Cirugeda-Roldán, Antonio Molina Picó, Daniel Novák, David Cuesta-Frau, Vaclav Kremen, ",Computational and mathematical methods in medicine,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30008796

1766,"PyFolding: Open-Source Graphing, Simulation, and Analysis of the Biophysical Properties of Proteins","For many years, curve-fitting software has been heavily utilized to fit simple models to various types of biophysical data. Although such software packages are easy to use for simple functions, they are often expensive and present substantial impediments to applying more complex models or for the analysis of large data sets. One field that is reliant on such data analysis is the thermodynamics and kinetics of protein folding. Over the past decade, increasingly sophisticated analytical models have been generated, but without simple tools to enable routine analysis. Consequently, users have needed to generate their own tools or otherwise find willing collaborators. Here we present PyFolding, a free, open-source, and extensible Python framework for graphing, analysis, and simulation of the biophysical properties of proteins. To demonstrate the utility of PyFolding, we have used it to analyze and model experimental protein folding and thermodynamic data. Examples include: 1) multiphase kinetic folding fitted to linked equations, 2) global fitting of multiple data sets, and 3) analysis of repeat protein thermodynamics with Ising model variants. Moreover, we demonstrate how PyFolding is easily extensible to novel functionality beyond applications in protein folding via the addition of new models. Example scripts to perform these and other operations are supplied with the software, and we encourage users to contribute notebooks and models to create a community resource. Finally, we show that PyFolding can be used in conjunction with Jupyter notebooks as an easy way to share methods and analysis for publication and among research teams.","['1 London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London, London, United Kingdom; Department of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, London, United Kingdom; Department of Biological Sciences, Birkbeck College, University of London, London, United Kingdom.

1767,Investigating the Potential of Ion Mobility-Mass Spectrometry for Microalgae Biomass Characterization,"Algae biomass is formed by an extremely complex set of metabolites, and its molecular characterization has been very challenging. We report the characterization of microalgae extracts via traveling wave ion mobility-mass spectrometry (TWIM-MS) by two different analysis strategies. First, the extracts were analyzed by direct infusion electrospray ionization (ESI) with no previous chromatographic separation (DI-ESI-TWIM-MS). Second, the samples were screened for metabolites and lipids using an untargeted high-throughput method that employs ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) using data-independent analysis (DIA) - MSE (UHPLC-HDMSE). Sixteen different microalgae biomasses were evaluated by both strategies. DI-ESI-TWIM-MS was able, via distinct drift times, to set apart different classes of metabolites, with the differences in the profiles of each microalga readily evident. With the UHPLC-HDMSE approach, 1251 different compounds were putatively annotated across 16 samples with 210 classified as lipids. From the normalized abundance for each annotated compound category, a detailed profiling in terms of metabolites, lipids, and lipid classes of each sample was performed. The reported workflow represents a powerful tool to determine the most suitable biotechnological applications for a given alga type and may allow for real-time monitoring of the algae composition distribution as a function of growth conditions, feedstocks, and the like. The determination of collision cross section results in improved confidence in the identification of triacylglycerols in samples, highly applicable to biofuels production. The two analysis strategies explored in this work offer powerful tools for the biomass industry by aiding in the identification of ideal strains and culture conditions for a specific application, saving analysis time and facilitating identification of a large number of constituents at once.","['1 National Institute of Metrology, Quality and Technology (INMETRO), Division of Chemical and Thermal Metrology , Laboratory of Organic Analysis , 25250-020 , Duque de Caxias , Rio de Janeiro , Brazil.', '2 ThoMSon Mass Spectrometry Laboratory, Institute of Chemistry , University of Campinas - UNICAMP , 13083-970 Campinas , São Paulo , Brazil.', '3 MS Applications and Development Laboratory , Waters Corporation , 06455-000 Barueri , São Paulo , Brazil.', '4 Department of Biochemistry and Molecular and Cellular Biology , Georgetown University , Washington DC 20007 , United States.', '5 Microalgal Biotechnology Laboratory , National Institute of Technology (INT) , 20081-312 Rio de Janeiro , Rio de Janeiro , Brazil.', '6 Mackenzie Presbyterian University , School of Engineering , 01302-907 São Paulo , São Paulo , Brazil.']","Maíra Fasciotti, Gustavo H M F Souza, Giuseppe Astarita, Ingrid C R Costa, Thays V C Monteiro, Claudia M L L Teixeira, Marcos N Eberlin, Amarijt S Sarpal, ",Analytical chemistry,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31149811

Synthetic biomolecular liquids offer a means to study the mechanisms of this process, as well as offering a route to the creation of functional biomimetic materials. With these goals in mind, we here examine the partitioning of long double-stranded DNA linkers into a liquid composed of small DNA particles (""nanostars"") whose phase separation is driven by base pairing. We find that linker partitioning is length-dependent because of a confinement penalty of inserting long strands within the liquid's characteristic mesh size. We quantify this entropic-confinement effect using a simple partitioning theory and show that its magnitude is consistent with classic Odijk pictures of confined worm-like chains. Linker partitioning can also lead to inhomogeneous structures: long linkers excluded from the liquid interior tend to preferentially accumulate on the surface of liquid droplets (i.e., acting as surfactants), while linkers forced at high concentrations into the liquid undergo a secondary phase separation, forming metastable droplet-in-droplet structures.

Yet, designing PPGs with sufficient 2P photosensitivity still remains challenging. Direct enhancement of the 2P absorption properties usually relies on modifications of the PPG structure, which sometimes results in unpredictable and counterproductive effects on the uncaging quantum yield. In that respect, combining known PPGs with a suitable two-photon light-harvesting antenna within a modular architecture offers a promising alternative. In this Minireview, we highlight this versatile strategy, with a discussion of different tandem 2P uncagers, relying on photoinduced electron transfer (PET), triplet- energy transfer (TT-ET), or Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensitization to enhance the 2P sensitivity of PPGs.","['1 Université de Bordeaux, Institut des Sciences Moléculaires (UMR5255 CNRS), 351 cours de la libération, 33450, Talence, France.']","Maxime Klausen, Victor Dubois, Jean-Baptiste Verlhac, Mireille Blanchard-Desce, ",ChemPlusChem,2019 Jun,nonlinear optics; photochemistry; photolabile protecting groups; sensitizers; two-photon uncaging.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31944026

When cut in two, the bisected tissue reorganizes into fully behaving animals in approximately 48 hours. Furthermore, new animals can reform from aggregates of dissociated cells. Understanding how behaviors are coordinated by this highly plastic nervous system could reveal basic principles of neural circuit dynamics underlying behaviors. However, Hydra's deformable and contractile body makes it difficult to manipulate the local environment while recording neural activity. Here, we present the first microfluidic technologies capable of simultaneous electrical, chemical, and optical interrogation of these soft, deformable organisms. Specifically, we demonstrate devices that can immobilize Hydra for hours-long simultaneous electrical and optical recording, and chemical stimulation of behaviors revealing neural activity during muscle contraction. We further demonstrate quantitative locomotive and behavioral tracking made possible by confining the animal to quasi-two-dimensional micro-arenas. Together, these proof-of-concept devices show that microfluidics provide a platform for scalable, quantitative cnidarian neurobiology.

1775,Mapping heterogeneity of cellular mechanics by multi-harmonic atomic force microscopy,"The goal of mechanobiology is to understand the links between changes in the physical properties of living cells and normal physiology and disease. This requires mechanical measurements that have appropriate spatial and temporal resolution within a single cell. Conventional atomic force microscopy (AFM) methods that acquire force curves pointwise are used to map the heterogeneous mechanical properties of cells. However, the resulting map acquisition time is much longer than that required to study many dynamic cellular processes. Dynamic AFM (dAFM) methods using resonant microcantilevers are compatible with higher-speed, high-resolution scanning; however, they do not directly acquire force curves and they require the conversion of a limited number of instrument observables to local mechanical property maps. We have recently developed a technique that allows commercial AFM systems equipped with direct cantilever excitation to quantitatively map the viscoelastic properties of live cells. The properties can be obtained at several widely spaced frequencies with nanometer-range spatial resolution and with fast image acquisition times (tens of seconds). Here, we describe detailed procedures for quantitative mapping, including sample preparation, AFM calibration, and data analysis. The protocol can be applied to different biological samples, including cells and viruses. The transition from dAFM imaging to quantitative mapping should be easily achievable for experienced AFM users, who will be able to set up the protocol in <30 min.","['1 School of Mechanical Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA.', '2 Birck Nanotechnology Center, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA.', '3 Laboratory of Cellular Biology, Section on Auditory Mechanics, National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, Bethesda, MD, USA.', '4 Department of Biological Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA.', '5 Bindley Bioscience Center, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA.', '6 Purdue Institute for Integrative Neuroscience, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA.', '7 School of Mechanical Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA. raman@purdue.edu.', '8 Birck Nanotechnology Center, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA. raman@purdue.edu.']","Yuri M Efremov, Alexander X Cartagena-Rivera, Ahmad I M Athamneh, Daniel M Suter, Arvind Raman, ",Nature protocols,2018 Oct,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30218102

1778,A REVIEW ON THE RADIATION THERAPY TECHNOLOGIST RECEIVED DOSE FROM INDUCED ACTIVATION IN HIGH-ENERGY MEDICAL LINEAR ACCELERATORS,"Despite all advantages for using high-energy photons for radiotherapy, high-energy photon beams (≥10 MV) induce photonuclear and neutron capture interactions, which result in producing radionuclide byproducts inside the Linac head and bunker, exposing radiation therapy technologists (RTTs) and patients to excessive dose. By the use of higher photon energy, greater number of monitor unit, greater field size and adding treatment accessories, induced dose rate become greater in the isocenter mainly due to activation of high-Z materials inside the Linac head. Activated radionuclides disintegrate with γ, β+ and β- rays with half-lives between 2 min up to more than 5 years. Several researches estimated additional exposure to an RTT depend on treatment strategies, beam energy, and delay time before entrance to the treatment room between 0.1 and 4.9 mSv/y and proposed at least 2 min delay before entrance to the treatment room after treatments with high-energy photon beams.","['1 Medical Radiation Sciences Research Team, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', '2 Department of Medical Physics, Medical School, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', '3 Molecular Medicine Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.']","Bahareh Nourmohammadi, Asghar Mesbahi, ",Radiation protection dosimetry,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29309661
1779,"Prospective, Randomized, Sham-Control, Double Blind, Crossover Trial of Subthreshold Spinal Cord Stimulation at Various Kilohertz Frequencies in Subjects Suffering From Failed Back Surgery Syndrome (SCS Frequency Study)","Introduction:
      
    

    
      The increasing use of high frequency paresthesia-free spinal cord stimulation has been associated with improved outcomes in the therapy of neuropathic pain. What is unknown is the effect of varying frequency on pain relief and the placebo effect. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      This is a prospective, randomized, sham-controlled double blind crossover study. Subjects with predominantly axial low back pain undergoing spinal cord stimulation therapy for failed back surgery syndrome were randomized to sham, 1200 Hz, 3030 Hz, and 5882 Hz with a four-phase crossover design over 12 weeks. Results:
      
    

    
      Twenty-four patients were randomized in the study. The mean low back pain score at baseline was 7.75. The mean low back pain scores on a 10 cm visual analog scale during the randomized crossover phase were 4.83, 4.51, 4.57, and 3.22, for sham, 1200 Hz, 3030 Hz, and 5882 Hz, respectively, with the lowest low back pain score observed in the 5882 Hz frequency group (p = 0.002). Of note, sham stimulation resulted in a reduction of pain by -2.92 cm and was not significantly different from stimulation at 1200 Hz and 3030 Hz. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      This randomized crossover study demonstrated that 5882 Hz stimulation can produce significant pain relief for axial low back pain compared with lower frequencies and sham stimulation. Sham stimulation produced similar analgesic effects to 1200 Hz and 3030 Hz and this effect may influence future neuromodulation clinical trial designs.","[""1 Guy's and St. Thomas' Hospital NHS Trust, London, UK."", '2 Department of Clinical Research, Medtronic Neuromodulation, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', '3 Pain and Headache Centre, Anchorage, AK, USA.']","Adnan Al-Kaisy, Stefano Palmisani, David Pang, Karen Sanderson, Samuel Wesley, Ye Tan, Sheryl McCammon, Andrea Trescott, ",Neuromodulation : journal of the International Neuromodulation Society,2018 Jul,Double-blind; failed back surgery syndrome; high frequency electrical stimulation; low back pain; prospective; randomized study; spinal cord stimulation.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29608229
1780,Linear array detector for online diagnostics of spectral distributions at MHz repetition rates,"Free-electron lasers (FELs) based on superconducting accelerator technology and storage ring facilities operate with bunch repetition rates in the MHz range, and the need arises for bunch-by-bunch electron and photon diagnostics. For photon-pulse-resolved measurements of spectral distributions, fast one-dimensional profile monitors are required. The linear array detector KALYPSO (KArlsruhe Linear arraY detector for MHz-rePetition rate SpectrOscopy) has been developed for electron bunch or photon pulse synchronous read-out with frame rates of up to 2.7 MHz. At the FLASH facility at DESY, a current version of KALYPSO with 256 pixels has been installed at a grating spectrometer as online diagnostics to monitor the pulse-resolved spectra of the high-repetition-rate FEL pulses. Application-specific front-end electronics based on MicroTCA standard have been developed for data acquisition and processing. Continuous data read-out with low latency in the microsecond range enables the integration into fast feedback applications. In this paper, pulse-resolved FEL spectra recorded at 1.0 MHz repetition rate for various operation conditions at FLASH are presented, and the first application of an adaptive feedback for accelerator control based on photon beam diagnostics is demonstrated.","['1 Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY), Hamburg, Germany.', '2 Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen, Germany.', '3 Lodz University of Technology, Department of Microelectronics and Computer Science, Lodz, Poland.']","Christopher Gerth, Günter Brenner, Michele Caselle, Stefan Düsterer, Daniel Haack, Dariusz Makowski, Aleksander Mielczarek, Steffen Palutke, Lorenzo Rota, Vladimir Rybnikov, Christian Schmidt, Bernd Steffen, Kai Tiedtke, ",Journal of synchrotron radiation,2019,extreme ultraviolet radiation; free-electron laser; high repetition rate diagnostics; line scan camera; linear array detector; soft X-ray spectroscopy.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31490139
1781,Microrheology of DNA hydrogels,"A key objective in DNA-based material science is understanding and precisely controlling the mechanical properties of DNA hydrogels. We perform microrheology measurements using diffusing wave spectroscopy (DWS) to investigate the viscoelastic behavior of a hydrogel made of Y-shaped DNA (Y-DNA) nanostars over a wide range of frequencies and temperatures. We observe a clear liquid-to-gel transition across the melting temperature region for which the Y-DNA bind to each other. Our measurements reveal a cross-over between the elastic [Formula: see text] and loss modulus [Formula: see text] around the melting temperature [Formula: see text] of the DNA building blocks, which coincides with the systems percolation transition. This transition can be easily shifted in temperature by changing the DNA bond length between the Y shapes. Using bulk rheology as well, we further show that, by reducing the flexibility between the Y-DNA bonds, we can go from a semiflexible transient network to a more energy-driven hydrogel with higher elasticity while keeping the microstructure the same. This level of control in mechanical properties will facilitate the design of more sensitive molecular sensing tools and controlled release systems.","['1 Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB3 0HE, United Kingdom; zx230@cam.ac.uk ee247@cam.ac.uk.', '2 Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB3 0HE, United Kingdom.', '3 Department of Chemistry, University of Tsinghua, Beijing 100084, China.']","Zhongyang Xing, Alessio Caciagli, Tianyang Cao, Iliya Stoev, Mykolas Zupkauskas, Thomas O'Neill, Tobias Wenzel, Robin Lamboll, Dongsheng Liu, Erika Eiser, ",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2018,DNA nanotechnology; hydrogels; microrheology; self-assembly; semiflexible polymers.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30045862

In addition, the touch gestures used to perceive an object's properties differ among people. We combined studies on the biophysical properties and the vibrations measured from the human finger to understand the age and gender effects on the tactile perception and the difference between the touch gestures. In addition, a new algorithm, Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), was used to analyze the vibratory signal obtained from the physical contact of the finger, and a surface is proposed and validated. The values obtained regarding the correlation between the tribohaptic system results and the biophysical properties show that the Young's modulus and the surface topography are the most important. An inverse correlation was observed between the MFCC and the tactile perception. This last observation explained the results of better tactile perception with left to right touch gestures. It also demonstrated a better tactile perception for women.","['1 Univ Lyon, Laboratoire de Tribologie et Dynamique des Systèmes-LTDS UMR-CNRS 5513, ECL-ENISE, F-69134, Ecully, France. abdouninaceur@hotmail.com.', '2 Univ Lyon, Laboratoire de Tribologie et Dynamique des Systèmes-LTDS UMR-CNRS 5513, ECL-ENISE, F-69134, Ecully, France.']","A Abdouni, R Vargiolu, H Zahouani, ",Scientific reports,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30135602

While uniphasic nanosecond pulse generators are widely available, the recent discovery that biological effects can be uniquely modulated by reversing the polarity of nanosecond duration pulses calls for the development of a multimodal pulse generator. This paper describes a method to generate nanosecond multiphasic pulses for biomedical use, and specifically demonstrates its ability to cancel or enhance cell swelling and blebbing. The generator consists of a series of the fundamental module, which includes a capacitor and a MOSFET switch. A positive or a negative phase pulse module can be produced based on how the switch is connected. Stacking the modules in series can increase the voltage up to 5 kV. Multiple stacks in parallel can create multiphase outputs. As each stack is independently controlled and charged, multiphasic pulses can be created to produce flexible and versatile pulse waveforms. The circuit topology can be used for high-frequency uniphasic or biphasic nanosecond burst pulse production, creating numerous opportunities for the generator in electroporation applications, tissue ablation, wound healing, and nonthermal plasma generation.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Hollie A Ryan, Shinji Hirakawa, Enbo Yang, Chunrong Zhou, Shu Xiao, ",IEEE transactions on biomedical circuits and systems,2018 Apr,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29570061
1785,Bridging the structural gap of glycoproteomics with ion mobility spectrometry,"Over the past two decades mass spectrometry (MS) has enabled high throughput studies on the level of a complex proteome. While it has similarly advanced glycobiology, the level of progress has been more restrained. This is in large part due to the diversity and complexity of carbohydrate structures. While MS is now routinely used for glycobiology, it suffers from a critical limitation, that is the inability to resolve isobaric structures. Since so many structurally and functionally distinct carbohydrates are indistinguishable by MS, additional techniques are needed for detailed structural analysis. Ion mobility spectrometry (IMS), with its ability to resolve closely related isobaric structures, presents such a tool for alleviating the current limitations of MS. In the past few years studies have demonstrated the utility and immense potential of combining IMS with MS (IM-MS) for glycomics and it is now approaching the point of enabling comprehensive structural studies on the level of the glycoproteome.","['1 Department of Medicinal Chemistry, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, United States.', '2 Department of Medicinal Chemistry, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, United States.

1786,CoExpresso: assess the quantitative behavior of protein complexes in human cells,"Background:
      
    

    
      Translational and post-translational control mechanisms in the cell result in widely observable differences between measured gene transcription and protein abundances. Herein, protein complexes are among the most tightly controlled entities by selective degradation of their individual proteins. They furthermore act as control hubs that regulate highly important processes in the cell and exhibit a high functional diversity due to their ability to change their composition and their structure. Better understanding and prediction of these functional states demands methods for the characterization of complex composition, behavior, and abundance across multiple cell states. Mass spectrometry provides an unbiased approach to directly determine protein abundances across different cell populations and thus to profile a comprehensive abundance map of proteins. Results:
      
    

    
      We provide a tool to investigate the behavior of protein subunits in known complexes by comparing their abundance profiles across up to 140 cell types available in ProteomicsDB. Thorough assessment of different randomization methods and statistical scoring algorithms allows determining the significance of concurrent profiles within a complex, therefore providing insights into the conservation of their composition across human cell types as well as the identification of intrinsic structures in complex behavior to determine which proteins orchestrate complex function. This analysis can be extended to investigate common profiles within arbitrary protein groups. CoExpresso can be accessed through http://computproteomics.bmb.sdu.dk/Apps/CoExpresso . Conclusions:

      The morphological alterations during pregnancy may affect the biomechanical loads during exercise practice. Aquatic exercises may suit pregnant women, who are recommended to exercise with low vertical ground reaction force loads. Therefore, the study aimed to determine the apparent weight reduction during immersion and the vertical ground reaction force of three specific water-based exercises in pregnant women at the third trimester. Methods:
      
    

    
      Eleven pregnant women volunteered to take part in the study [32.0 (SD 1.3) weeks, 28.1 (SD 5.7) years, 72.5 (SD 10.1) kg]. The protocol started with the participants immersed to the xiphoid process depth for the apparent weight assessment. Then, three water-based exercises (stationary running, frontal kick and butt kick) were randomly performed at a pre-selected cadence, with 5-min interval. The vertical ground reaction force was measured in each exercise and peak, impulse, contact time and swing time were determined. Repeated measures ANOVA was used (α = 0.05). Findings:
      
    

    
      The apparent weight reduction resulted a mean of 82.9 (SD 6.5)% of body weight. Peak, impulse, contact time and swing time revealed no significant difference between exercises (P > 0.05). Values of peak of vertical ground reaction force ranged from 0.67 to 0.72 units of body weight. Interpretation:
      
    

    
      Pregnant women at the third trimester can benefit from the apparent weight reduction during immersion for exercising. The three water-based exercises presented similar vertical ground reaction force values, which are considered as low odds for musculoskeletal injuries. Therefore, these findings highlight the safety of the water-based exercise program during pregnancy.","['1 Department of Sports, Federal University of Pelotas, Pelotas, Brazil.

1790,Rapid and efficient differentiation of functional motor neurons from human iPSC for neural injury modelling,"Primary rodent neurons and immortalised cell lines have overwhelmingly been used for in vitro studies of traumatic injury to peripheral and central neurons, but have some limitations of physiological accuracy. Motor neurons (MN) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) enable the generation of cell models with features relevant to human physiology. To facilitate this, it is desirable that MN protocols both rapidly and efficiently differentiate human iPSCs into electrophysiologically active MNs. In this study, we present a simple, rapid protocol for differentiation of human iPSCs into functional spinal (lower) MNs, involving only adherent culture and use of small molecules for directed differentiation, with the ultimate aim of rapid production of electrophysiologically functional cells for short-term neural injury experiments. We show successful differentiation in two unrelated iPSC lines, by quantifying neural-specific marker expression, and by evaluating cell functionality at different maturation stages by calcium imaging and patch clamping. Differentiated neurons were shown to be electrophysiologically altered by uniaxial mechanical deformation. Spontaneous network activity decreased with applied stretch, indicating aberrant network connectivity. These results demonstrate the feasibility of this rapid, simple protocol for differentiating iPSC-derived MNs, suitable for in vitro neural injury studies focussing on electrophysiological alterations caused by mechanical deformation or trauma.","['1 Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, OX3 7DQ, UK.', '2 Department Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics, University of Oxford, OX1 3QX, UK.', '3 Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, OX1 3PJ, UK.', '4 Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, OX3 7DQ, UK.

1792,Evaluation of loading parameters for murine axial tibial loading: Stimulating cortical bone formation while reducing loading duration,"Classic studies in bone mechanobiology have established the importance of loading parameters on the anabolic response. Most of these early studies were done using loading methods not currently in favor, and using non-murine species. Our objective was to re-examine the effects of several loading parameters on the response of cortical bone using the contemporary murine axial tibial compression model. We subjected tibias of 5-month old, female C57Bl/6 mice to cyclic (4 Hz) mechanical loading and examined bone formation responses using dynamic and static histomorphometry. First, using a reference protocol of 1,200 cycles/day, 5 days/week for 2 weeks, we confirmed the significant influence of peak strain magnitude on periosteal mineralizing surface (Ps.MS/BS) and bone formation rate (Ps.BFR/BS) (p < 0.05, ANOVA). There was a significant induction of periosteal lamellar bone at a lower threshold of approx. -1,000 μϵ and a transition from lamellar-woven bone near -2,000 μϵ. In contrast, on the endocortical surface, bone formation indices did not exhibit a load magnitude-dependent response and no incidence of woven bone. Next, we found that reducing daily cycle number from 1,200 to 300 to 60 did not diminish the bone formation response (p > 0.05). On the other hand, reducing the daily frequency of loading from 5 consecutive days/week to 3 alternate days/week significantly diminished the periosteal response, from a loading-induced increase in Ps.MS/BS of 38% (loaded vs. control) for 5 days/week to only 15% for 3 days/week (p < 0.05). Finally, we determined that reducing the study duration from 2 to 1 weeks of loading did not affect bone formation outcomes. In conclusion, cyclic loading to -1,800 μϵ peak strain, at 4 Hz and 60 cycles/day for 5 consecutive days (1 week) induces an increase in periosteal lamellar bone formation with minimal incidence of woven bone in 5-month-old C57Bl/6 female mice. Our results provide a basis for reduction of loading duration (daily cycles and study length) without loss of anabolic effect as measured by dynamic histomorphometry. © 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society.

With 5-year cancer survival for adults above 70%, increasingly research is focusing on quantifying and reducing treatment-related morbidity. Reducing exposures to healthy tissues is one strategy, which can be accomplished with advanced-technology radiotherapies, such as intensity-modulated photon therapy and proton therapy. Both of these modalities provide good conformation of the therapeutic dose to the tumor volume, but they also deliver stray radiation to the whole body that increases the risk of radiogenic second cancers. To minimize these risks, one needs to create and compare candidate treatment plans that explicitly take into account these risks. Currently, clinical practice does not include routine calculation of stray radiation exposure and, consequently, the assessment of corresponding risks is difficult. In this article, we review recent progress toward stray dose algorithms that are suitable for large-scale clinical use. In particular, we emphasize the current state of physics-based dose algorithms for intensity-modulated photon radiotherapy and proton therapy.","['1 Department of Physics and Astronomy, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, USA.', '2 Physics Department, Mary Bird Perkins Cancer Center, Baton Rouge, USA.']","W D Newhauser, C Schneider, L Wilson, S Shrestha, W Donahue, ",Radiation protection dosimetry,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29177488

1796,Syringe-injectable Mesh Electronics for Stable Chronic Rodent Electrophysiology,"Implantable brain electrophysiology probes are valuable tools in neuroscience due to their ability to record neural activity with high spatiotemporal resolution from shallow and deep brain regions. Their use has been hindered, however, by mechanical and structural mismatches between the probes and brain tissue that commonly lead to micromotion and gliosis with resulting signal instability in chronic recording experiments. In contrast, following the implantation of ultraflexible mesh electronics via syringe injection, the mesh probes form a seamless, gliosis-free interface with the surrounding brain tissue that enables stable tracking of individual neurons on at least a year timescale. This protocol details the key steps in a typical mouse neural recording experiment using syringe-injectable mesh electronics, including the fabrication of mesh electronics in a standard photolithography-based process possible at many universities, loading mesh electronics into standard capillary needles, stereotaxic injection in vivo, connection of the mesh input/output to standard instrumentation interfaces, restrained or freely moving recording sessions, and histological sectioning of brain tissue containing mesh electronics. Representative neural recordings and histology data are presented. Investigators familiar with this protocol will have the knowledge necessary to incorporate mesh electronics into their own experiments and take advantage of the unique opportunities afforded by long-term stable neural interfacing, such as studies of aging processes, brain development, and the pathogenesis of brain disease.","['1 John A.

1797,Molecular and Electrophysiological Analyses of ATP2B4 Gene Variants in Bilateral Adrenal Hyperaldosteronism,"Primary aldosteronism (PA) is the most common cause of secondary hypertension with a high prevalence among patients with resistant hypertension. Despite the recent discovery of somatic variants in aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA)-associated PA, causes for PA due to bilateral aldosterone production (bilateral hyperaldosteronism; BHA) remain unknown. Herein, we identified rare gene variants in ATP2B4, in a cohort of patients with BHA. ATP2B4 belongs to the same family of Ca-ATPases as ATP2B3, which is involved in the pathogenesis of APA. Endogenous ATP2B4 expression was characterized in adrenal tissue, and the gene variants were functionally analyzed for effects on aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) expression, steroid production in basal and agonist-stimulated conditions, and for changes in biophysical properties of channel properties. Knockdown of ATP2B4 in HAC15 exhibited reduced angiotensin II stimulation in one of four shRNA clones. Stable HAC15 cell lines with doxycycline (dox) - inducible wild-type and variant forms of ATP2B4 - were generated, and dox-induced upregulation of ATP2B4 mRNA and protein was confirmed. However, ATP2B4 variants did not alter basal or agonist-stimulated CYP11B2 expression. Whole-cell recordings in HAC15 cells indicated robust endogenous ATP2B4 conductance in native cells but reduced conductance with overexpressed WT and variant ATP2B4. The previously defined PA-causing ATP2B3 variant served as a positive control and exhibited elevated CYP11B2 mRNA. In conclusion, while this study did not confirm a pathogenic role for ATP2B4 variants in BHA, we describe the sequencing analysis for familial and sporadic BHA and outline a template for the thorough in vitro characterization of gene variants.","['1 Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology & Diabetes, University of Michigan, 1150 West Medical Center Drive, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA.', '2 Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', '3 Center for Arrhythmia Research, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', '4 Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', '5 Department of Medical Sciences, Division of Internal Medicine and Hypertension, University of Torino, Via Genova 3, 10126, Torino, Italy.', '6 Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology & Diabetes, University of Michigan, 1150 West Medical Center Drive, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA. telse@umich.edu.']","Namita Ganesh Hattangady, Jessica Foster, Antonio Marcondes Lerario, Daniela Ponce-Balbuena, Juilee Rege, Silvia Monticone, William E Rainey, Paolo Mulatero, Tobias Else, ",Hormones & cancer,2020 Feb,ATP2B3; ATP2B4; Aldosterone; Ca-ATPases; Doxycycline-inducible expression; Primary aldosteronism.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32002807
1798,Hydrophobic Amines and Their Guanidine Analogues Modulate Activation and Desensitization of ASIC3,"Acid-sensing ion channel 3 (ASIC3) is an important member of the acid-sensing ion channels family, which is widely expressed in the peripheral nervous system and contributes to pain sensation. ASICs are targeted by various drugs and toxins. However, mechanisms and structural determinants of ligands' action on ASIC3 are not completely understood. In the present work we studied ASIC3 modulation by a series of ""hydrophobic monoamines"" and their guanidine analogs, which were previously characterized to affect other ASIC channels via multiple mechanisms. Electrophysiological analysis of action via whole-cell patch clamp method was performed using rat ASIC3 expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. We found that the compounds studied inhibited ASIC3 activation by inducing acidic shift of proton sensitivity and slowed channel desensitization, which was accompanied by a decrease of the equilibrium desensitization level. The total effect of the drugs on the sustained ASIC3-mediated currents was the sum of these opposite effects. It is demonstrated that drugs' action on activation and desensitization differed in their structural requirements, kinetics of action, and concentration and state dependencies. Taken together, these findings suggest that effects on activation and desensitization are independent and are likely mediated by drugs binding to distinct sites in ASIC3.","['1 I.M.

1799,Strategy to Identify Improved N-Terminal Modifications for Supramolecular Phenylalanine-Derived Hydrogelators,"Supramolecular hydrogels formed by self-assembly of low molecular weight (LMW) compounds have been identified as promising materials for applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. In many cases, the relationship between the chemical structure of the gelator and the emergent hydrogel properties is poorly understood. As a result, empirical screening strategies instead of rational design approaches are often relied upon to tune the emergent properties of the gels. Herein, we describe a novel strategy to identify improved phenylalanine (Phe) derived gelators using a focused empirical approach. Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) protected Phe derivatives are a privileged class of gelators that spontaneously self-assemble into fibrils that entangle to form a hydrogel network upon dissolution into water. However, the Fmoc group has been shown to have toxicity drawbacks for potential biological applications, requiring the identification of new N-terminal modifications that promote efficient self-assembly but lack the shortcomings of the Fmoc group. We previously discovered that fibrils in Fmoc-p-nitrophenylalanine (Fmoc-4-NO2-Phe) hydrogels transition to crystalline microtubes after several hours by a mechanism that involves the hierarchical assembly and fusion of the hydrogel fibrils. We hypothesized that this hierarchical crystallization behavior could form the basis of a screening approach to identify alternative N-terminal functional groups to replace Fmoc in Phe-derived LMW gelators. Specifically, screening N-terminal modifying groups for 4-NO2-Phe that stabilize the hydrogel state by preventing subsequent hierarchical crystallization would facilitate empirical identification of functional Fmoc replacements. To test this approach, we screened a small series of 4-NO2-Phe derivatives with various N-terminal modifying groups to determine if any provided stable LMW supramolecular hydrogels. All but one of the 4-NO2-Phe derivatives assembled into crystalline forms. Only the 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (1-Nap) 4-NO2-Phe derivative self-assembled into a stable hydrogel network. Additional Phe derivatives were modified by N-terminal 1-Nap groups to confirm the general potential of 1-Nap as a suitable replacement for Fmoc, and all derivatives formed stable hydrogels under similar conditions to their Fmoc-Phe counterparts. These results illustrate the potential of this approach to identify next-generation Phe-derived LMW gelators with improved emergent properties.","['1 Department of Chemistry , University of Rochester , Rochester , New York 14627-0216 , United States.']","Brittany L Abraham, Wathsala Liyanage, Bradley L Nilsson, ",Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31664849
1800,Nanomechanics of Extracellular Vesicles Reveals Vesiculation Pathways,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are emerging as important mediators of cell-cell communication as well as potential disease biomarkers and drug delivery vehicles. However, the mechanical properties of these vesicles are largely unknown, and processes leading to microvesicle-shedding from the plasma membrane are not well understood. Here an in depth atomic force microscopy force spectroscopy study of the mechanical properties of natural EVs is presented. It is found that several natural vesicles of different origin have a different composition of lipids and proteins, but similar mechanical properties. However, vesicles generated by red blood cells (RBC) at different temperatures/incubation times are different mechanically. Quantifying the lipid content of EVs reveals that their stiffness decreases with the increase in their protein/lipid ratio. Further, by maintaining RBC at ""extreme"" nonphysiological conditions, the cells are pushed to utilize different vesicle generation pathways. It is found that RBCs can generate protein-rich soft vesicles, possibly driven by protein aggregation, and low membrane-protein content stiff vesicles, likely driven by cytoskeleton-induced buckling. Since similar cortical cytoskeleton to that of the RBC exists on the membranes of most mammalian cells, our findings help advancing the understanding of the fundamental process of vesicle generation.","['1 Department of Physics and Astronomy and LaserLab, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, 1081 HV, the Netherlands.', '2 Department of Clinical Chemistry and Haematology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, 3584 CX, the Netherlands.', '3 Department of Biomolecular Sciences, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, 761000, Israel.', '4 Department of Biochemistry, Radboud University Medical Center, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Nijmegen, NL-6500 HB, the Netherlands.', '5 Institute of Medical Physics and Biophysics, University of Leipzig, Medical Faculty, Härtelstr. 16/18, 04107, Leipzig, Germany.', '6 Department of Chemical and Biological Physics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, 761000, Israel.', '7 Department of Molecular Biophysics, Zernike Instituut, Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, Nijenborgh 4, Groningen, 9747 AG, the Netherlands.']","Raya Sorkin, Rick Huisjes, Filip Bošković, Daan Vorselen, Silvia Pignatelli, Yifat Ofir-Birin, Joames K Freitas Leal, Jürgen Schiller, Debakshi Mullick, Wouter H Roos, Giel Bosman, Neta Regev-Rudzki, Raymond M Schiffelers, Gijs J L Wuite, ","Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2018 Sep,AFM; RBC; extracellular vesicles; membrane biophysics.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30160371
1801,Lower limb amputee gait characteristics on a specifically designed test ramp: Preliminary results of a biomechanical comparison of two prosthetic foot concepts,"Background:
      
    

    
      For demanding activities in daily life, such as negotiating stairs, ramps and uneven ground, the functionality of conventional prosthetic feet (""Daily Life Feet"" - DLF) is often limited. With the introduction of microprocessor-controlled feet (MPF) it was expected that the functional limitations of DLF might be reduced. The purpose of the present study was to investigate biomechanical gait parameters with DLF and MPF when walking on a specifically designed ramp involving abruptly changing inclination angles as a scenario reflecting typical situations related to walking on uneven ground. Research question:
      
    

    
      The specific aim of the study was to answer the research question if the advanced adaptability of MPF to different ground slopes would lead to more natural motion patterns and reduced joint loading compared with DLF feet. Methods:
      
    

    
      A specifically designed ramp was installed within a gait lab. During downward motion on this ramp biomechanical parameters - ground reaction forces, joint moments and joint angles were obtained both with DLF and MPF used by four transtibial amputees. A control group of 10 non-amputees (NA) was measured with for comparison. Results:
      
    

    
      The NA group managed the ramp element with the abruptly changing inclination with a specific ankle joint adaptation. Compared to DLF the MPF considerably improved the ankle adaptation to the abruptly changing inclination which was reflected by a significantly increased stance phase dorsiflexion which was comparable to the NA group. The peak value of the knee extension moment on the prosthetic side was significantly increased with DLF, whereas it was almost normal with MPF (DLF: 0.71 ± 0.13 Nm/kg, MPF: 0.42 ± 0.12 Nm/kg, NA: 0.36 ± 0.07 Nm/kg, p < 0.05 and p < 0.01). The external knee adduction moment was generally reduced for the transtibial amputees and did not show differences between foot designs. Significance:
      
    

    
      The adaptable ankle joint motion of the MPF is a crucial requirement for a more natural motion pattern and leads to a reduction of sagittal knee joint loading on the prosthetic side.","['1 Otto Bock Healthcare GmbH, Hermann-Rein-Straße 2a, 37075, Göttingen, Germany.

1802,Biophysical Studies on HCV 1a NS3/4A Protease and Its Catalytic Triad in Wild Type and Mutants by the In Silico Approach,"The hepatitis C virus (HCV), of the family flaviviridae, is one of the major causes of chronic liver diseases. Until the year 2012, HCV infections were treated using PEG-interferon and ribavirin combinations, which have a low cure rate and severe side effects. Currently, many direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) are available, e.g. protease inhibitors, NS5A and polymerase inhibitors. These drugs have proven to be efficient in interferon-free treatment combinations and capable of enhancing the cure rate to above 90 %. Unlike PEG-interferon and ribavirin combinations, DAAs select for resistance in HCV. The R155K mutation in the HCV was found to resist all the currently available protease inhibitors. Here, we studied biophysical parameters like pocket (cavity) geometries and stabilizing residues of HCV 1a NS3/4A protease in wild type and mutants. We also studied HCV 1a NS3/4A protease's catalytic residues: their accessibility, energy, flexibility and binding to Phase II oral protease inhibitor vedroprevir (GS-9451), and compared these parameters between wild type and mutant(s). All these studies were performed using various bioinformatics tools (e.g. Swiss-PdbViewer and Schrödinger's Maestro) and web servers (e.g. DoGSiteScorer, SRide, ASA-View, WHAT IF, elNémo, CABS-flex, PatchDock and PLIP). From our study, we found that introduction of R155K, A156T or D168A mutation to wild-type NS3/4A protease increases the pocket's volume, surface (in the R155K mutant, surface decreases), lipo surface and depth and decreases the number of stabilizing residues. Additionally, differences in catalytic residues' solvent accessibility, energy, root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) and flexibility between wild type and mutants might explain changes in the protease activity and the resistance to protease inhibitors.","['1 Synthetic Biology Group, Institute of Pharmacy and Molecular Biotechnology (IPMB), University of Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 267 (BioQuant), 69120, Heidelberg, Germany. navaneethan.palanisamy@bioquant.uni-heidelberg.de.', '2 The Hartmut Hoffmann-Berling International Graduate School of Molecular and Cellular Biology (HBIGS), University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany. navaneethan.palanisamy@bioquant.uni-heidelberg.de.', '3 Section of Clinical Virology, Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, 751 85, Uppsala, Sweden. navaneethan.palanisamy@bioquant.uni-heidelberg.de.', '4 Section of Clinical Virology, Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, 751 85, Uppsala, Sweden.']","Navaneethan Palanisamy, Johan Lennerstrand, ","Interdisciplinary sciences, computational life sciences",2018 Mar,Biophysical studies; Hepatitis C virus (HCV); Mutants; NS3/4A protease; Vedroprevir (GS-9451).,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27311576
1803,Lipodisqs for eukaryote lipidomics with retention of viability: Sensitivity and resistance to Leucobacter infection linked to C.elegans cuticle composition,"Lipodisq™ nanoparticles have been used to extract surface lipids from the cuticle of two strains (wild type, N2 and the bacteria-resistant strain, agmo-1) of the C. elegans nematode without loss of viability. The extracted lipids were characterized by thin layer chromatography and MALDI-TOF-MS. The lipid profiles differed between the two strains. The extracted lipids from the bacteria-resistant strain, agmo-1, contained ether-linked (O-alkyl chain) lipids, in contrast to the wild-type strain which contained exclusively ester- linked (O-acyl) lipids. This observation is consistent with the loss of a functional alkylglycerol monooxygenase (AGMO) in the bacterial resistant strain agmo-1. The presence and abundance of other lipid species also differs between the wild-type N2 and agmo-1 nematodes, suggesting that the agmo-1 mutant strain attempts to compensate for the increase in ether-linked lipids by modulating other lipid-synthesis pathways. Together these differences not only affect the fragility of the cuticle and the buoyancy of the worm in aqueous buffer, but also interactions with surface-adhering bacteria. The much greater chemical stability of O-alkyl, non-hydrolysable linked lipids compared with hydrolysable O-acyl linked lipids, may be the origin of the resistance of the agmo-1 strain to bacterial infection, providing a more resilient cuticle for the nematode. Additionally, we show that lipid extraction with a polymer of styrene and maleic acid (SMA) provides a viable route to lipidomics studies with minimal perturbation of the organism.","['1 Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, OX1 3QU, Oxford, United Kingdom.', '2 Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, OX1 3QU, Oxford, United Kingdom.

1804,Relative Yield of MEG and EEG Spikes in Simultaneous Recordings,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      Most clinical magnetoencephalography (MEG) centers record both MEG and EEG, but model only MEG sources. This may be related to the belief that MEG spikes are more prevalent, MEG is more sensitive, or to proprietary software limitations. Biophysics would contend, however, that EEG, being sensitive to radial and tangential source orientations, would provide complementary data for analysis. Methods:
      
    

    
      We recorded 306 channels of MEG and 25 channels of EEG simultaneously in 297 consecutive patients over 3 years. We inspected the MEG and EEG recordings separately, identified spikes in both, determined whether their voltage and/or magnetometer magnetic fields were dipolar and thus model-worthy, and segregated them into types based on similar and distinct field topography. We placed for each patient their spike types into categories, including those with both a recognizable MEG and EEG signal and those with only an MEG and only an EEG signal. Results:
      
    

    
      Eighty-three percent of patients had spikes recorded, and these patients had an average of 2.7 spike types each. Fifty-six percent of spike types were present in both MEG and EEG. However, 36% of spike types were only evident in EEG, whereas 8% were noted in MEG alone. In 49% of patients with spikes, MEG review missed at least one spike type, whereas in 17% of patients, EEG review missed at least one spike type. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      To obtain an optimal yield of diagnostic information, EEG should also be subjected to source analysis in any clinical MEG study. EEG and MEG data are indeed complementary.","['1 Northeast Regional Epilepsy Group, MEG Center, Overlook Medical Center, Summit, New Jersey, U.S.A.', '2 Neuroscan-Compumedics, Hamburg, Germany.']","John S Ebersole, Michael Wagner, ",Journal of clinical neurophysiology : official publication of the American Electroencephalographic Society,2018 Nov,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30234690

The workflow comprised a Box-Behnken experimental design with 47 experiments followed by the identification and quantification of a set of metabolites using high-resolution full-scan MS mode and feature extraction with an inclusion list. Metabolite peak areas were grouped according to abundance (high and low) and modeled by Random Forest regression (variance explained >85%). The full three-level factorial design consisting in 243 experiments was predicted and top 10 solutions for desirability function and those comprising the Pareto front were extracted and investigated. To guarantee the quality of results, we compared the Pareto front solutions with those achieved by standard instrumental parameters suggested by the manufacturer. A set of five solutions were identified that increased the mean peak area by 56-59% and 17%, for high- and low-abundance metabolites, respectively. The optimal parameters were determined to be: FLP, 100 V; FDC, 40 and 30 V; Frag, 275 and 400 V; and Oct, 600 and 800 V.

1807,Metabolic Mapping: Quantitative Enzyme Cytochemistry and Histochemistry to Determine the Activity of Dehydrogenases in Cells and Tissues,"Altered cellular metabolism is a hallmark of many diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases and infection. The metabolic motor units of cells are enzymes and their activity is heavily regulated at many levels, including the transcriptional, mRNA stability, translational, post-translational and functional level. This complex regulation means that conventional quantitative or imaging assays, such as quantitative mRNA experiments, Western Blots and immunohistochemistry, yield incomplete information regarding the ultimate activity of enzymes, their function and/or their subcellular localization. Quantitative enzyme cytochemistry and histochemistry (i.e., metabolic mapping) show in-depth information on in situ enzymatic activity and its kinetics, function and subcellular localization in an almost true-to-nature situation. We describe a protocol to detect the activity of dehydrogenases, which are enzymes that perform redox reactions to reduce cofactors such as NAD(P)+ and FAD. Cells and tissue sections are incubated in a medium that is specific for the enzymatic activity of one dehydrogenase. Subsequently, the dehydrogenase that is the subject of investigation performs its enzymatic activity in its subcellular site. In a chemical reaction with the reaction medium, this ultimately generates blue-colored formazan at the site of the dehydrogenase's activity. The formazan's absorbance is therefore a direct measure of the dehydrogenase's activity and can be quantified using monochromatic light microscopy and image analysis. The quantitative aspect of this protocol enables researchers to draw statistical conclusions from these assays. Besides observational studies, this technique can be used for inhibition studies of specific enzymes. In this context, studies benefit from the true-to-nature advantages of metabolic mapping, giving in situ results that may be physiologically more relevant than in vitro enzyme inhibition studies. In all, metabolic mapping is an indispensable technique to study metabolism at the cellular or tissue level. The technique is easy to adopt, provides in-depth, comprehensive and integrated metabolic information and enables rapid quantitative analysis.","['1 Cancer Center Amsterdam, Department of Medical Biology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; r.j.molenaar@amc.uva.nl.', '2 Cancer Center Amsterdam, Department of Medical Biology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']","Remco J Molenaar, Mohammed Khurshed, Vashendriya V V Hira, Cornelis J F Van Noorden, ",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29889193

1810,"HOPE: Hybrid-Drive Combining Optogenetics, Pharmacology and Electrophysiology","Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying human cognition and determining the causal factors for the development of brain pathologies are among the greatest challenges for society. Electrophysiological recordings offer remarkable observations of brain activity as they provide highly precise representations of information coding in both temporal and spatial domains. With the development of genetic tools over the last decades, mice have been a key model organism in neuroscience. However, conducting chronic in vivo electrophysiology in awake, behaving mice remains technically challenging, and this difficulty prevents many research teams from acquiring critical recordings in their mouse models. Behavioral training, implant fabrication, brain surgery, data acquisition and data analysis are all required steps that must be mastered in order to perform cutting-edge experiments in systems neuroscience. Here, we present a new method that simplifies the construction of a drivable and multi-task electrophysiological recording implant without loss of flexibility and recording power. The hybrid-drive combining optogenetics, pharmacology and electrophysiology (HOPE) can support up to 16 tetrodes, attached to a single drive mechanism, organized in two bundles of eight tetrodes, allowing recordings in two different mouse brain regions simultaneously with two optical fibers for optogenetic manipulation or two injection cannulas for drug-delivery experiments. Because it can be printed with a latest-generation desktop 3D printer, the production cost is low compared to classical electrophysiology implants, and it can be built within a few hours.

Spinal cord stimulation combinations (200-500 μs/30-130 Hz) at suprathreshold intensity were tested over a 1- to 4-month period, and the effects of spinal cord stimulation were studied 6 months after spinal cord stimulation surgery. Protokinetics Walkway measured gait parameters. Z scores per gait variable established each participant's best spinal cord stimulation setting. Timed sit-to-stand and automated freezing-of-gait detection using foot pressures were analyzed. Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (FOG-Q), UPDRS motor items, and activities-specific balance confidence scale were completed at each study visit. Results:
      
    

    
      Spinal cord stimulation setting combinations of 300-400 μs/30-130 Hz provided gait improvements. Although on-medication/on-stimulation at 6 months, mean step length, stride velocity, and sit-to-stand improved by 38.8%, 42.3%, and 50.3%, respectively, mean UPDRS, Freezing of Gait Questionnaire, and activities-specific balance confidence scale scores improved by 33.5%, 26.8%, and 71.4%, respectively. The mean number of freezing-of-gait episodes reduced significantly from 16 presurgery to 0 at 6 months while patients were on levodopa and off stimulation. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      By using objective measures to detect dynamic gait characteristics, the therapeutic potential of spinal cord stimulation was optimized to each participant's characteristics. This pilot study demonstrated the safety and significant therapeutic outcome of spinal cord stimulation in advanced PD patients, and thus a larger and longer clinical study will be conducted to replicate these results. © 2018 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.","['1 London Health Sciences Centre - Lawson Health Research Institute, Department of Clinical Neurological Sciences, London, Ontario, Canada.', '2 University of Western Ontario, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, London, Ontario, Canada.']","Olivia Samotus, Andrew Parrent, Mandar Jog, ",Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society,2018 May,Parkinson's disease; gait dysfunction; kinematics; neuromodulation; spinal cord stimulation.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29442369
1812,Mechanobiological modeling of endochondral ossification: an experimental and computational analysis,"Long bone formation starts early during embryonic development through a process known as endochondral ossification. This is a highly regulated mechanism that involves several mechanical and biochemical factors. Because long bone development is an extremely complex process, it is unclear how biochemical regulation is affected when dynamic loads are applied, and also how the combination of mechanical and biochemical factors affect the shape acquired by the bone during early development. In this study, we develop a mechanobiological model combining: (1) a reaction-diffusion system to describe the biochemical process and (2) a poroelastic model to determine the stresses and fluid flow due to loading. We simulate endochondral ossification and the change in long bone shapes during embryonic stages. The mathematical model is based on a multiscale framework, which consisted in computing the evolution of the negative feedback loop between Ihh/PTHrP and the diffusion of VEGF molecule (on the order of days) and dynamic loading (on the order of seconds). We compare our morphological predictions with the femurs of embryonic mice. The results obtained from the model demonstrate that pattern formation of Ihh, PTHrP and VEGF predict the development of the main structures within long bones such as the primary ossification center, the bone collar, the growth fronts and the cartilaginous epiphysis. Additionally, our results suggest high load pressures and frequencies alter biochemical diffusion and cartilage formation. Our model incorporates the biochemical and mechanical stimuli and their interaction that influence endochondral ossification during embryonic growth. The mechanobiochemical framework allows us to probe the effects of molecular events and mechanical loading on development of bone.","['1 Biomimetics Laboratory, Instituto de Biotecnología, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogotá, Colombia.', '2 Numerical Methods and Modeling Research Group (GNUM), Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Carrera 30 No 45-03 Edificio 407, Oficina 202A, Bogotá, Colombia.', '3 Institute for the Study of Inborn Errors of Metabolism, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogotá, Colombia.', '4 Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA.', '5 Biomimetics Laboratory, Instituto de Biotecnología, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogotá, Colombia. dagarzona@unal.edu.co.', '6 Numerical Methods and Modeling Research Group (GNUM), Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Carrera 30 No 45-03 Edificio 407, Oficina 202A, Bogotá, Colombia. dagarzona@unal.edu.co.']","J J Vaca-González, M Moncayo-Donoso, J M Guevara, Y Hata, S J Shefelbine, D A Garzón-Alvarado, ",Biomechanics and modeling in mechanobiology,2018 Jun,Bone development; Endochondral ossification; Ihh; PTHrP; VEGF.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29322335
1813,Editorial introduction,"Welcome to this Fourth Special Issue of Molecular Biology of the Cell on Forces on and within Cells. As with our other Special Issues, the journal's goal here is to focus attention on a major new direction in cell biology. In this case, it is the field of mechanobiology, which endeavours, broadly, to understand how mechanical forces are harnessed to drive cellular function and how force can also be a mode of biological information that regulates cell behavior. The collection of papers that we have in this issue reflects many current efforts to address these questions. While each of these papers is a distinct creative effort of its authors, I would like to draw your attention to a number of themes that emerge across these diverse studies.","['1 Division of Cell and Developmental Biology, Institute for Molecular Bioscience, The University of Queensland, St. Lucia, Brisbane 4072, Australia.']","Alpha S Yap, ",Molecular biology of the cell,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32692641
1814,Immunohisto(cyto)chemistry: an old time classic tool driving modern oncological therapies,"In the era of precision medicine immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunocytochemistry (ICC) share some of the highlights in personalized treatment. Survival data obtained from clinical trials shape the cut-offs and IHC scoring that serve as recommendations for patient selection both for targeted and conventional therapies. Assessment of Estrogen and Progesterone Receptors along with HER2 status has been among the first approved immunostaining assays revolutionizing breast cancer treatment. Similarly, ALK positivity predicts the efficacy of ALK inhibitors in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In recent years, Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) IHC assays have been approved as companion or complimentary diagnostic tools predicting the response to checkpoint inhibitors. Anti-PD-L1 and anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies have inaugurated a new period in the treatment of advanced cancers, but the path to approval of these biomarkers is filled with immunohistochemical challenges. The latter brings to the fore the significance of molecular pathology as a hub between basic and clinical research. Besides, novel markers are translated into routine practice, suggesting that we are at the beginning of a new exciting period. Unraveling the molecular mechanisms involved in cellular homeostasis unfolds biomarkers with greater specificity and sensitivity. The introduction of GL13 (SenTraGor®) for the detection of senescent cells in archival material, the implementation of key players of stress response pathways and the development of compounds detecting common mutant P53 isoforms in dictating oncological treatments are paradigms for precision oncology.","['1 The Shraga Segal Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Genetics, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel.', '2 Molecular Carcinogenesis Group, Department of Histology and Embryology, School of Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', '3 Division of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece.', '4 PharmaInformatics Unit, Athena Research Center, Greece.', '5 Center for New Biotechnologies and Precision Medicine, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', '6 Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens, Athens, Greece.', '7 Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Manchester, UK.']","Tomer Cooks, Sofia Dp Theodorou, Eleni Paparouna, Sophia V Rizou, Vassilios Myrianthopoulos, Vassilis G Gorgoulis, Ioannis S Pateras, ",Histology and histopathology,2019 Apr,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30480312
1815,An Electrophysiology Protocol to Measure Reward Anticipation and Processing in Children,"We present a protocol designed to measure the neural correlates of reward in children. The protocol allows researchers to measure both reward anticipation and processing. Its purpose is to create a reward task that is appropriate for young children with and without autism while controlling reward properties between two conditions: social and nonsocial. The current protocol allows for comparisons of brain activity between social and nonsocial reward conditions while keeping the reward itself identical between conditions. Using this protocol, we found evidence that neurotypical children demonstrate enhanced anticipatory brain activity during the social condition. Furthermore, we found that neurotypical children anticipate social reward more robustly than children with autism diagnoses. As the task uses snacks as a reward, it is most appropriate for young children. However, the protocol may be adapted for use with adolescent or adult populations if snacks are replaced by monetary incentives. The protocol is designed to measure electrophysiological events (event-related potentials), but it may be customized for use with eye-tracking or fMRI.","['1 Graduate School of Education, University of California, Riverside; katherine.stavropoulos@ucr.edu.', '2 Psychology Department, University of California, San Diego.']","Katherine K M Stavropoulos, Leslie J Carver, ",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30346407
1816,"Recent Advances and New Perspectives in Capillary Electrophoresis-Mass Spectrometry for Single Cell ""Omics""","Accurate clinical therapeutics rely on understanding the metabolic responses of individual cells. However, the high level of heterogeneity between cells means that simply sampling from large populations of cells is not necessarily a reliable approximation of an individual cell's response. As a result, there have been numerous developments in the field of single-cell analysis to address this lack of knowledge. Many of these developments have focused on the coupling of capillary electrophoresis (CE), a separation technique with low sample consumption and high resolving power, and mass spectrometry (MS), a sensitive detection method for interrogating all ions in a sample in a single analysis. In recent years, there have been many notable advancements at each step of the single-cell CE-MS analysis workflow, including sampling, manipulation, separation, and MS analysis. In each of these areas, the combined improvements in analytical instrumentation and achievements of numerous researchers have served to drive the field forward to new frontiers. Consequently, notable biological discoveries have been made possible by the implementation of these methods. Although there is still room in the field for numerous further advances, researchers have effectively minimized various limitations in detection of analytes, and it is expected that there will be many more developments in the near future.","['1 Department of Chemistry, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1101 University Avenue, Madison, WI 53706, USA. kdelaney3@wisc.edu.', '2 Department of Chemistry, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1101 University Avenue, Madison, WI 53706, USA. csauer@wisc.edu.', '3 Department of Chemistry, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1101 University Avenue, Madison, WI 53706, USA. nqvu@wisc.edu.', '4 Department of Chemistry, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1101 University Avenue, Madison, WI 53706, USA. lingjun.li@wisc.edu.', '5 School of Pharmacy, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 777 Highland Avenue, Madison, WI 53705, USA. lingjun.li@wisc.edu.']","Kellen DeLaney, Christopher S Sauer, Nhu Q Vu, Lingjun Li, ","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2018,capillary electrophoresis; mass spectrometry; metabolomics; microchips; proteomics; single-cell analysis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30583525
1817,Efficient Decoding of Multi-Dimensional Signals From Population Spiking Activity Using a Gaussian Mixture Particle Filter,"New recording technologies and the potential for closed-loop experiments have led to an increasing demand for computationally efficient and accurate algorithms to decode population spiking activity in multi-dimensional spaces. Exact point process filters can accurately decode low-dimensional signals, but are computationally intractable for high-dimensional signals. Approximate Gaussian filters are computationally efficient, but are inaccurate when the signals have complex distributions and nonlinear dynamics. Even particle filter methods tend to become inefficient and inaccurate when the filter distribution has multiple peaks. Here, we develop a new point process filter algorithm that combines the computational efficiency of approximate Gaussian methods with a numerical accuracy that exceeds standard particle filters. We use a mixture of Gaussian model for the posterior at each time step, allowing for an analytic solution to the computationally expensive filter integration step. During non-spike intervals, the filter needs only to update the mean, covariance, and mixture weight of each component. At spike times, a sampling procedure is used to update the filtering distribution and find the number of Gaussian mixture components necessary to maintain an accurate approximation. We illustrate the application of this algorithm to the problem of decoding a rat's position and velocity in a maze from hippocampal place cell data using both 2-D and 4-D decoders.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Ali Yousefi, Anna K Gillespie, Jennifer A Guidera, Mattias Karlsson, Loren M Frank, Uri T Eden, ",IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,2019 Dec,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30932819

We investigate how the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans responds to time-varying mechanosensory signals using a high-throughput optogenetic assay and automated behavior quantification. We find that the behavioral response is tuned to temporal properties of mechanosensory signals, such as their integral and derivative, that extend over many seconds. Mechanosensory signals, even in the same neurons, can be tailored to elicit different behavioral responses. Moreover, we find that the animal's response also depends on its behavioral context. Most dramatically, the animal ignores all tested mechanosensory stimuli during turns. Finally, we present a linear-nonlinear model that predicts the animal's behavioral response to stimulus.","['1 Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics, Princeton University, New Jersey, United States.', '2 Department of Physics, Princeton University, New Jersey, United States.', '3 Princeton Neuroscience Institute, Princeton University, New Jersey, United States.']","Mochi Liu, Anuj K Sharma, Joshua W Shaevitz, Andrew M Leifer, ",eLife,2018,C. elegans; behavior; mechanosensation; neuroscience; optogenetics; physics of living systems; reverse correlation; sensory processing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29943731
1819,Implementing artificial neural networks through bionic construction,"It is evident through biology research that, biological neural network could be implemented through two means: by congenital heredity, or by posteriority learning. However, traditionally, artificial neural network, especially the Deep learning Neural Networks (DNNs) are implemented only through exhaustive training and learning. Fixed structure is built, and then parameters are trained through huge amount of data. In this way, there are a lot of redundancies in the implemented artificial neural network. This redundancy not only requires more effort to train the network, but also costs more computing resources when used. In this paper, we proposed a bionic way to implement artificial neural network through construction rather than training and learning. The hierarchy of the neural network is designed according to analysis of the required functionality, and then module design is carried out to form each hierarchy. We choose the Drosophila's visual neural network as a test case to verify our method's validation. The results show that the bionic artificial neural network built through our method could work as a bionic compound eye, which can achieve the detection of the object and their movement, and the results are better on some properties, compared with the Drosophila's biological compound eyes.","['1 Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.', '2 School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China.']","Hu He, Xu Yang, Zhiheng Xu, Ning Deng, Yingjie Shang, Guo Liu, Mengyao Ji, Wenhao Zheng, Jinfeng Zhao, Liya Dong, ",PloS one,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30794587

      Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM)-based targeted proteomics is increasingly being used to study the molecular basis of disease. When combined with an internal standard, MRM allows absolute quantification of proteins in virtually any type of sample but the development and validation of an MRM assay for a specific protein is laborious. Therefore, several public repositories now host targeted proteomics MRM assays, including NCI's Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium assay portals, PeptideAtlas SRM Experiment Library, SRMAtlas, PanoramaWeb and PeptideTracker, with all of which contain different levels of information. Results:
      
    

    
      Here we present MRMAssayDB, a web-based application that integrates these repositories into a single resource. MRMAssayDB maps and links the targeted assays, annotates the proteins with information from UniProtKB, KEGG pathways and Gene Ontologies, and provides several visualization options on the peptide and protein level. Currently MRMAssayDB contains >168K assays covering more than 34K proteins from 63 organisms; >13.5K of these proteins are present in >2.3K KEGG biological pathways corresponding to >300 master pathways, and mapping to >13K GO biological processes. MRMAssayDB allows comprehensive searches for a targeted-proteomics assay depending on the user's interests, by using target-protein name or accession number, or using annotations such as subcellular localization, biological pathway, or disease or drug associations. The user can see how many data repositories include a specific peptide assay, and the commonly used transitions for each peptide in all empirical data from the repositories.

1822,Estrogen receptor-α expressing neurons in the ventrolateral VMH regulate glucose balance,"Brain glucose-sensing neurons detect glucose fluctuations and prevent severe hypoglycemia, but mechanisms mediating functions of these glucose-sensing neurons are unclear. Here we report that estrogen receptor-α (ERα)-expressing neurons in the ventrolateral subdivision of the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (vlVMH) can sense glucose fluctuations, being glucose-inhibited neurons (GI-ERαvlVMH) or glucose-excited neurons (GE-ERαvlVMH). Hypoglycemia activates GI-ERαvlVMH neurons via the anoctamin 4 channel, and inhibits GE-ERαvlVMH neurons through opening the ATP-sensitive potassium channel. Further, we show that GI-ERαvlVMH neurons preferentially project to the medioposterior arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (mpARH) and GE-ERαvlVMH neurons preferentially project to the dorsal Raphe nuclei (DRN). Activation of ERαvlVMH to mpARH circuit and inhibition of ERαvlVMH to DRN circuit both increase blood glucose. Thus, our results indicate that ERαvlVMH neurons detect glucose fluctuations and prevent severe hypoglycemia in mice.","[""1 Children's Nutrition Research Center, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA."", '2 Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', '3 Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', '4 Department of Cell and Cancer Biology, Vontz Center for Molecular Studies, University of Cincinnati, College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, 45267, USA.', '5 Departments of Pharmacology, University of Texas Health at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, 78229, USA.', '6 Center for Precision Health, School of Biomedical Informatics, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', '7 Brown Foundation Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', '8 Department of Medicine, Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', ""9 Children's Nutrition Research Center, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. yongx@bcm.edu."", '10 Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. yongx@bcm.edu.']","Yanlin He, Pingwen Xu, Chunmei Wang, Yan Xia, Meng Yu, Yongjie Yang, Kaifan Yu, Xing Cai, Na Qu, Kenji Saito, Julia Wang, Ilirjana Hyseni, Matthew Robertson, Badrajee Piyarathna, Min Gao, Sohaib A Khan, Feng Liu, Rui Chen, Cristian Coarfa, Zhongming Zhao, Qingchun Tong, Zheng Sun, Yong Xu, ",Nature communications,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32358493
1823,Kinetic Measurements of Singlet Oxygen Phosphorescence in Hydrogen-Free Solvents by Time-Resolved Photon Counting,"Solvents lacking hydrogen atoms are very convenient models for elucidating the properties of singlet oxygen, since the lifetime of singlet oxygen in these solvents reaches tens milliseconds. Measuring intrinsic infrared (IR) phosphorescence of singlet oxygen at 1270 nm is the most reliable method of singlet oxygen detection. However, efficient application of the phosphorescence method to these models requires an equipment allowing reliable measurement of the phosphorescence kinetic parameters in the millisecond time range at low rates of singlet oxygen generation, which is a technically difficult problem. Here, we describe a highly sensitive LED (laser) spectrometer recently constructed in our laboratory for the steady-state and time-resolved measurements of the millisecond phosphorescence of singlet oxygen. In the steady-state mode, this spectrometer allows detection of singlet oxygen phosphorescence upon direct excitation of oxygen molecules in the region of dark-red absorption bands at 690 and 765 nm. For kinetic measurements, we used phenalenone as a photosensitizer, microsecond pulses of violet (405 nm) LED for excitation (irradiance intensity, ≤50 μW/cm2), a photomultiplier and a computer multichannel scaler for time-resolved photon counting. The decays of singlet oxygen in air-saturated CCl4, C6F6, and Freon 113 and quenching of singlet oxygen by phenalenone and dissolved molecules of triplet oxygen were measured. The relative values of the radiative rate constants of singlet oxygen in these media were determined. The results were compared with the absorption coefficients of oxygen measured by our group using the methods of laser photochemistry. Critical discussion of the obtained results and the data of other researchers is presented.","['1 Federal Research Center of Biotechnology, A. N.

Alternatively, the Q Exactive HF-X is capable of achieving the same proteome coverage as its predecessor in approximately half the gradient time or at 10-fold lower sample loads. The Q Exactive HF-X also enables rapid phosphoproteomics with routine analysis of more than 5000 phosphopeptides with short single-shot 15 min LC-MS/MS measurements, or 16 700 phosphopeptides quantified across ten conditions in six gradient hours using TMT10-plex and offline peptide fractionation.

1827,Remodeling of Chlamydomonas Metabolism Using Synthetic Inducers Results in Lipid Storage during Growth,"Microalgae accumulate lipids during stress such as that of nutrient deprivation, concomitant with cessation of growth and depletion of chloroplasts. By contrast, certain small chemical compounds selected by high-throughput screening in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii can induce lipid accumulation during growth, maintaining biomass. Comprehensive pathway analyses using proteomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics data were acquired from Chlamydomonas cells grown in the presence of one of two structurally distinct lipid activators. WD10784 stimulates both starch and lipid accumulation, whereas WD30030-treated cells accumulate only lipids. The differences in starch accumulation are largely due to differential effects of the two compounds on substrate levels that feed into starch synthesis and on genes encoding starch metabolic enzymes. The compounds had differential effects on photosynthesis, respiration, and oxidative stress pathways. Cells treated with WD10784 showed slowed growth over time and reduced abundance of photosynthetic proteins, decreased respiration, and increased oxidative stress proteins, glutathione, and reactive oxygen species specific to this compound. Both compounds maintained central carbon and nitrogen metabolism, including the tricarboxylic acid cycle, glycolysis, respiration, and the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle.

1828,Design of an Optical Probe to Monitor Vaginal Hemodynamics during Sexual Arousal,"An optical probe was developed to measure the change of oxy-hemoglobin (OHb), deoxy- hemoglobin (RHb), and total hemoglobin (THb) along with temperature from the vaginal wall of female rats. Apomorphine (APO, 80 μg/kg) was administered to elicit sexual arousal in female Sprague Dawley rats (SD, 180-200 g). The behavior changes caused by APO administration were checked before monitoring vaginal responses. The changes of oxy-, deoxy-, and total hemoglobin concentration and the temperature from the vaginal wall were monitored before, during, and after APO administration. Animals were under anesthesia during the measurement. After APO administration, the concentration of OHb (55 ± 29 μM/DPF), RHb (33 ± 25 μM/DPF), and THb (83 ± 59 μM/DPF) in the vaginal wall increased in a few min, while saline administration did not cause any significant change. In case of the vaginal temperature change, APO decreased the temperature slightly in the vaginal wall while saline administration did not show any temperature change in the vaginal wall. As the outcomes demonstrated, the developed probe can detect hemodynamic and temperature variation in the vaginal wall. The hemodynamic information acquired by the probe can be utilized to establish an objective and accurate standard of female sexual disorders.","['1 Department of Biomedical Science and Engineering, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST), Gwangju 61005, Korea. ryun@gist.ac.kr.', '2 Department of Biomedical Science and Engineering, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST), Gwangju 61005, Korea. myeongsuseong@sjtu.edu.cn.', '3 Department of Urology, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju 61186, Korea. sys23@hanmail.net.', '4 Department of Urology, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju 61186, Korea. uropark@gmail.com.', '5 Department of Physics, Kookmin University, Seoul 02707, Korea. moons@kookmin.ac.kr.', '6 Department of Biomedical Science and Engineering, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST), Gwangju 61005, Korea. jaekim@gist.ac.kr.']","Hyeryun Jeong, Myeongsu Seong, Hyun-Suk Lee, Kwangsung Park, Sucbei Moon, Jae Gwan Kim, ","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019,apomorphine; female sexual dysfunction; hemodynamics; sexual arousal; temperature; vaginal wall.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31071987
1829,"Impact of acute handling stress, anaesthesia, and euthanasia on fish plasma biochemistry: implications for veterinary screening and metabolomic sampling","Impacts of pre-sampling practices on fish plasma biochemistry may bias the outcome of a study if not considered within the general sampling strategy. Acute handling stresses can be imposed on fish during capture, and it is common practice to immobilise fish via sedation prior to obtaining blood samples for non-lethal extraction purposes, and/or to reduce stress, pain, or suffering before being euthanised. We investigated these potential influences using a Chinook salmon model (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) by measuring levels of 119 biochemical targets comprising ions, metabolites, and enzymes in plasma. Multivariate analyses showed that 2 min of confinement with mild handling manipulation led to a significant departure from baseline metabolism, which was further exasperated during a prolonged 5-min challenge. These changes were characterised by a disruption in osmoregulation, a switch towards anaerobic metabolism, and shifts in ammonia recycling, among others. Sedation of fish with clove oil and AQUI-S® had major impacts on plasma biochemical profiles, with alterations signalling changes in glycolytic metabolism, respiratory modes, carbon flux through the TCA cycle, and lipid compartmentalisation. Sedation also enhanced levels of plasma amino acids, revealing a key difference between responses to handling stress and sedation. These results demonstrate that pre-harvest practices should be carefully managed during fish sampling for biochemical/metabolomic-based analyses, and if manipulations are essential, they should be standardised.","['1 Aquaculture Biotechnology Research Group, School of Science, Faculty of Health and Environmental Sciences, Auckland University of Technology, Private Bag 92006, Auckland, 1142, New Zealand.', '2 The Centre for Biomedical and Chemical Sciences, School of Science, Faculty of Health and Environmental Sciences, Auckland University of Technology, Private Bag 92006, Auckland, 1142, New Zealand.', '3 Cawthron Institute, Nelson, New Zealand.', '4 Aquaculture Biotechnology Research Group, School of Science, Faculty of Health and Environmental Sciences, Auckland University of Technology, Private Bag 92006, Auckland, 1142, New Zealand. andrea.alfaro@aut.ac.nz.', '5 Rwebitaba Zonal Agricultural Research and Development Institute (Rwebitaba-ZARDI), National Agricultural Research Organisation (NARO), P.

Cognitive psychology laboratory studies show that repeated testing of information produces superior retention relative to repeated study. The overall goal of this intervention was to evaluate the effectiveness of ""Test enhanced learning"" in the form of ""Open book examination"" as a formative assessment in Biochemistry when compared to ""Self-study."" Three exercises were carried out after the regular teaching sessions on different topics in biochemistry for the first year MBBS students. A multiple choice questions based pretest was conducted after the regular lecture classes on a topic but before the revision exercise. The students were subjected ""Open book examination"" with short answer questions for a period of 1 hour. A posttest was done with the same set of MCQs after the revision exercises. The gain score of ""Open book examination"" was compared with that of ""Self study."" Feedback from the students was taken. The isolated results from each of the three exercises conducted and their combined results supported the hypothesis that ""Test enhanced learning"" in the form of open book examination is a superior form of learning process than self-study for assimilation of knowledge. Most of the students opined that the ""Open book examination"" enhanced their self directed focused learning process. The students felt that ""Open book examination"" is more beneficial than ""Self study"" in reinforcing the learning concepts after regular didactic lectures. © 2018 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 46(5):472-477, 2018.","['1 Department of Biochemistry, Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research, Puducherry, India 605006.', '2 Department of Biochemistry, Government Sivagangai Medical College, Sivagangai, Tamil Nadu, India 630561.']","Zachariah Bobby, Kavitha Meiyappan, ",Biochemistry and molecular biology education : a bimonthly publication of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,2018 Sep,Test-enhanced learning; formative assessment; open-book examination; self-directed learning.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30369035
1832,Maximizing Aggregation of Organic Fluorophores to Prolong Fluorescence Lifetime for Two-Photon Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging,"Two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging (TP-FLIM) not only permits imaging deep inside the tissues with precise spatial manipulation but also circumvents tissue autofluorescence, holding tremendous promise in molecular imaging. However, the serious lack of suitable contrast agents with long fluorescence lifetime and efficient two-photon absorption (TPA) greatly limits the advance of TP-FLIM. This study reports a simple approach to fabricate water-soluble organic semiconducting nanoparticles [thioxanthone (TXO) NPs] with ultralong fluorescence lifetime and efficient TPA for in vivo TP-FLIM. The approach utilizes the aggregation of a specifically selected thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) fluorophore to prolong its fluorescence lifetime. Encapsulating the TADF fluorophore within an amphiphilic copolymer not only maximizes its aggregation but also obtains TXO NPs with efficient TPA. Importantly, as-prepared TXO NPs exhibit a considerably long fluorescence lifetime at a magnitude of 4.2 µs, which is almost 1000 times larger than that of existing organic contrast agents. Moreover, such long fluorescence lifetime is almost oxygen-inert, readily realizing both in vitro and in vivo TP-FLIM. This work may set valuable guidance for designing organic semiconducting materials with ultralong fluorescence lifetimes to fulfill the potential of FLIM.","['1 Key Laboratory of Flexible Electronics (KLOFE) & Institute of Advanced Materials (IAM), Jiangsu National Synergetic Innovation Center for Advanced Materials (SICAM), Nanjing Tech University (NanjingTech), Nanjing, 211816, China.', '2 Key Laboratory for Organic Electronics and Information Displays & Institute of Advanced Materials (IAM), Jiangsu National Synergetic Innovation Center for Advanced Materials (SICAM), Nanjing University of Posts & Telecommunications, Nanjing, 210023, China.', ""3 Shaanxi Institute of Flexible Electronics (SIFE), Northwestern Polytechnical University (NPU), Xi'an, 710072, China.""]","Wenbo Hu, Lihong Guo, Lei Bai, Xiaofei Miao, Yun Ni, Qi Wang, Hui Zhao, Meng Xie, Lin Li, Xiaomei Lu, Wei Huang, Quli Fan, ",Advanced healthcare materials,2018 Aug,aggregation-induced emission; organic semiconducting nanoparticles; two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging; ultralong fluorescence lifetime.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29806163
1833,The polygonal model: A simple representation of biomolecules as a tool for teaching metabolism,"Metabolism involves numerous reactions and organic compounds that the student must master to understand adequately the processes involved. Part of biochemical learning should include some knowledge of the structure of biomolecules, although the acquisition of such knowledge can be time-consuming and may require significant effort from the student. In this report, we describe the ""polygonal model"" as a new means of graphically representing biomolecules. This model is based on the use of geometric figures such as open triangles, squares, and circles to represent hydroxyl, carbonyl, and carboxyl groups, respectively. The usefulness of the polygonal model was assessed by undergraduate students in a classroom activity that consisted of ""transforming"" molecules from Fischer models to polygonal models and vice and versa. The survey was applied to 135 undergraduate Biology and Nursing students. Students found the model easy to use and we noted that it allowed identification of students' misconceptions in basic concepts of organic chemistry, such as in stereochemistry and organic groups that could then be corrected. The students considered the polygonal model easier and faster for representing molecules than Fischer representations, without loss of information. These findings indicate that the polygonal model can facilitate the teaching of metabolism when the structures of biomolecules are discussed. Overall, the polygonal model promoted contact with chemical structures, e.g. through drawing activities, and encouraged student-student dialog, thereby facilitating biochemical learning. © 2017 by The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 46(1):66-75, 2018.","['1 Department of Biochemistry and Tissue Biology, Institute of Biology, University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Rua Monteiro Lobato, 255, Campinas, SP, 13083-970, Brazil.', '2 Department of Technology, Faculty of Food Engineering, University of Feira de Santana (UEFS), CP 252/294, Feira de Santana, BA, 44036-900, Brazil.']","Carlos Francisco Sampaio Bonafe, Jose Ailton Conceição Bispo, Marcelo Bispo de Jesus, ",Biochemistry and molecular biology education : a bimonthly publication of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,2018 Jan,Biomolecule representations; polygonal model; visual literacy.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29131491
1834,All-around management of a fungal isolate obtained from cheese spoilage as an environmental source: Direct approach from an undergrad student to a biotechnological characterization,"In this work, we present the results of an undergrad student from the perspective of its first approach as a principal researcher in a project. In order to gain practical experience, one of the options for students that have interest in pursuing a postgraduate program corresponds to a research stay in a laboratory of their selected field conducting a project for a period of 6 months. In this particular project, a fungal sample was isolated from Parmesan cheese spoilage and its enzymatic activity evaluated. Using simple and standardized protocols, the student was capable of identifying a possible biotechnological application for the isolate by detecting and categorizing the lipolytic activity. Through microculture characterization in potato dextrose agar (PDA) the genus of the sample was determined as Penicillium and confirmed by molecular analysis of the ITS1 and ITS4 regions. In order to examine comprehensively the potential of the new isolate, the extracellular and intracellular enzymatic activities were analyzed as well as four methods of cell rupture. From these results, sonication was determined as the best technique with 211 U/L as a maximum lipolytic value. To finalize the evaluation of the sample, the student determined the optimal pH and temperature as well as the thermotolerance of the crude extract obtaining a residual activity of 13% after 60 minutes of incubation at 45 °C. Upon conclusion of the research we could recognize that through a direct characterization of a fungal isolate using techniques that are widely known, the student was capable of determining and value one of the most interesting capabilities fungi has to offer; enzymatic activity, and that the knowledge obtained from established protocols enables and encourages the students to correlate the source from where they were obtained with potential biotechnological applications. © 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 47(6):681-688, 2019.","['1 Biotechnology Institute, Biological Sciences Faculty, Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León, San Nicolás de los Garza, Nuevo León, Mexico.']","Eugenia Guadalupe Ortiz Lechuga, Omar Eduardo Tovar Herrera, Katiushka Arévalo Niño, ",Biochemistry and molecular biology education : a bimonthly publication of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,2019 Nov,Fungi; Penicillium; lipase; parmesan.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31386304

In the past this often involved students writing out pathways by hand, and more recently directing students to online resources such as videos, songs, and animated slide presentations. However, even these latter resources do not really provide students an opportunity to engage with the material in an active fashion. As part of an online introductory metabolism course that was developed at our university, we created a series of twelve online interactive activities using Adobe Captivate 9. These activities targeted glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, the pentose phosphate pathway, glycogen metabolism, the citric acid cycle, and fatty acid oxidation. The interactive exercises consisted of two types. One involved dragging objects such as names of enzymes or allosteric modifiers to their correct drop locations such as a particular point in a metabolic pathway, a specific enzyme, and so forth. A second type involved clicking on objects, locations within a pathway, and so forth, in response to a particular question. In both types of exercises, students received feedback on their decisions in order to enhance learning. The student feedback received on these activities was very positive, and indicated that they found them to increase their confidence in the material and that they had learned the key principles of each pathway. © 2018 by The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 46(3):223-229, 2018.","['1 Department of Biochemistry, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon SK S7N 5E5, Canada.', '2 Distance Education Unit, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon SK S7N 1M3, Canada.']","William J Roesler, Kristine Dreaver-Charles, ",Biochemistry and molecular biology education : a bimonthly publication of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,2018 May,Interactive exercises; click-box; drag-and-drop interactions; eLearning; metabolic pathways; online learning.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29388322
1839,Stability-normalised walking speed: A new approach for human gait perturbation research,"In gait stability research, neither self-selected walking speeds, nor the same prescribed walking speed for all participants, guarantee equivalent gait stability among participants. Furthermore, these options may differentially affect the response to different gait perturbations, which is problematic when comparing groups with different capacities. We present a method for decreasing inter-individual differences in gait stability by adjusting walking speed to equivalent margins of stability (MoS). Eighteen healthy adults walked on a split-belt treadmill for two-minute bouts at 0.4 m/s up to 1.8 m/s in 0.2 m/s intervals. The stability-normalised walking speed (MoS = 0.05 m) was calculated using the mean MoS at touchdown of the final 10 steps of each speed. Participants then walked for three minutes at this speed and were subsequently exposed to a treadmill belt acceleration perturbation. A further 12 healthy adults were exposed to the same perturbation while walking at 1.3 m/s: the average of the previous group. Large ranges in MoS were observed during the prescribed speeds (6-10 cm across speeds) and walking speed significantly (P < 0.001) affected MoS. The stability-normalised walking speeds resulted in MoS equal or very close to the desired 0.05 m and reduced between-participant variability in MoS. The second group of participants walking at 1.3 m/s had greater inter-individual variation in MoS during both unperturbed and perturbed walking compared to 12 sex, height and leg length-matched participants from the stability-normalised walking speed group. The current method decreases inter-individual differences in gait stability which may benefit gait perturbation and stability research, in particular studies on populations with different locomotor capacities.

1840,Increasing Signal-to-Noise Ratio in Gas Chromatography - Electroantennography Using a Deans Switch Effluent Chopper,"Gas-chromatography-electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) is a technique used in the identification of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as pheromones and plant host odors, which are physiologically relevant to insects. Although pheromones often elicit large EAD responses, other behaviorally relevant odors may elicit responses that are difficult to discern from noise. Lock-in amplification has long been used to reduce noise in a wide range of applications. Its utility when incorporated with GC-EAD was demonstrated previosuly by chopping (or pulsing) effluent-laden air that flowed over an insect antenna. This method had the disadvantage that it stimulated noise-inducing mechanoreceptors and, in some cases, disturbed the electrochemical interfaces in a preparation, limiting its performance. Here, the chopping function necessary for lock-in amplification was implemented directly on the GC effluent using a simple Deans switch. The technique was applied to excised antennae from female Heliothis virescens responding to phenethyl alcohol, a common VOC emitted by plants. Phenethyl alcohol was always visible and quantifiable on the flame ionization detector (FID) chromatogram, allowing the timing and amount of stimulus delivered to the antennal preparation to be measured. In our new chopper EAG configuration, the antennal preparation was shielded from air currents in the room, further reducing noise. A dose-response model in combination with a Markov-chain monte-carlo (MCMC) method for Bayesian inference was used to estimate and compare performance in terms of error rates involved in the detection of insect responses to GC peaks visible on an FID detector. Our experiments showed that the predicted single-trial phenethyl alcohol detection limit on female H. virescens antennae (at a 5.0% expected error rate) was 140,330 pg using traditional EAG recording methods, compared to 2.6-6.3 pg (5th to the 95th percentile) using Deans switch-enabled lock-in amplification, corresponding to a 10.4-12.7 dB increase in signal-to-noise ratio.","['1 Department of Entomology, Chemical Ecology Laboratory, Penn State University, University Park, PA, 16802, USA. ajm25@psu.edu.', '2 Department of Entomology, Chemical Ecology Laboratory, Penn State University, University Park, PA, 16802, USA.']","Andrew J Myrick, Thomas C Baker, ",Journal of chemical ecology,2018 Feb,Deans switch; Electroantennogram; GC-EAD; GC-EAG; Lock-in amplification; Signal processing; Signal-to-noise ratio.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29306995

1846,Proteomic and metabolomic insights into the functions of the male reproductive system in fishes,"Proteomics and metabolomics are emerging and powerful tools to unravel the complex molecular mechanisms regulating reproduction in male fish. So far, numerous proteins and metabolites have been identified that provide us with valuable information to conduct a comprehensive analysis on seminal plasma and spermatozoa components and their functions. These analyses have allowed a better understanding of the blood-testis barrier functions, the molecular mechanisms underlying spermatogenesis, spermatozoa maturation, motility signaling, and competition as well as the mechanism of cryodamage to sperm structure and functions. To extend, proteins that undergo posttranslational modification, such as phosphorylation and oxidation in response to spermatozoa motility activation and cryopreservation, respectively, have been identified. Proteomic studies resulted in identification of potential proteins that can be used as biomarkers for sperm quality and freezability to enable the control of artificial reproduction, and to improve methods for long-term preservation (cryopreservation) of sperm. The different proteins expressed in the spermatozoa of neomales and normal males can also provide new insights into development of methods for separating X and Y fish sperm, and changes in the protein profiles in haploid and diploid spermatozoa will provide new perspectives to better understand the mechanism of male polyploidy. Overall, the knowledge gained by proteomic and metabolomic studies is important from basic to applied sciences for the development and/or optimisation of techniques in controlled fish reproduction.","['1 Institute of Animal Reproduction and Food Research, Polish Academy of Sciences, Tuwima 10, 10-748, Olsztyn, Poland.

1847,Experimental time resolution limits of modern SiPMs and TOF-PET detectors exploring different scintillators and Cherenkov emission,"Solid state photodetectors like silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) are playing an important role in several fields of medical imaging, life sciences and high energy physics. They are able to sense optical photons with a single photon detection time precision below 100 ps, making them ideal candidates to read the photons generated by fast scintillators in time of flight positron emission tomography (TOF-PET). By implementing novel high-frequency readout electronics, it is possible to perform a completely new evaluation of the best timing performance achievable with state-of-the-art analog-SiPMs and scintillation materials. The intrinsic SiPM single photon time resolution (SPTR) was measured with Ketek, HPK, FBK, SensL and Broadcom devices. Also, the best achieved coincidence time resolution (CTR) for these devices was measured with LSO:Ce:Ca of [Formula: see text] mm3 and [Formula: see text] mm3 size crystals. The intrinsic SPTR for all devices ranges between 70 ps and 135 ps FWHM when illuminating the entire [Formula: see text] mm2 or [Formula: see text] mm2 area. The obtained CTR with LSO:Ce:Ca of [Formula: see text] mm3 size ranges between 58 ps and 76 ps FWHM for the SiPMs evaluated. Bismuth Germanate (BGO), read out with state of-the-art NUV-HD SiPMs from FBK, achieved a CTR of 158 [Formula: see text] ps and 277 [Formula: see text] ps FWHM for [Formula: see text] mm3 and [Formula: see text] mm3 crystals, respectively. Other BGO geometries yielded 167 [Formula: see text] 3 ps FWHM for [Formula: see text] mm3 and 235 [Formula: see text] 5 ps FWHM for [Formula: see text] mm3 also coupled with Meltmount (n = 1.582) and wrapped in Teflon. Additionally, the average number of Cherenkov photons produced by BGO in each 511 keV event was measured to be 17 [Formula: see text] 3 photons. Based on this measurement, we predict the limits of BGO for ultrafast timing in TOF-PET with Monte Carlo simulations. Plastic scintillators (BC422, BC418), BaF2, GAGG:Ce codoped with Mg and CsI:undoped were also tested for TOF performance. Indeed, BC422 can achieve a CTR of 35 [Formula: see text] 2 ps FWHM using only Compton interactions in the detector with a maximum deposited energy of 340 keV. BaF2 with its fast cross-luminescence enables a CTR of 51 [Formula: see text] 5 ps FWHM when coupled to VUV-HD SiPMs from FBK, with only ∼22% photon detection efficiency (PDE). We summarize the measured CTR of the various scintillators and discuss their intrinsic timing performance.","[""1 UniMIB, Piazza dell'Ateneo Nuovo, 1-20126, Milano, Italy.

1848,Hybrid images as part of the primary school chemistry class instruction: Mastering the concepts of amino acids and proteins,"In this study, a set of hybrid images was designed as a new and up-to-date unexamined type of external visual representations in the chemistry classroom. One challenging teaching theme was chosen (""Amino acids and proteins""), and the hybrid images were used among novices-primary school students. For the purpose of the study, two groups were formed: experimental and control. The experimental group was taught using the hybrid images, while the control group was subjected to a traditional approach. After conducting the experiment, no statistically significant difference in the average performances between the two groups was found. However, the experimental group outperformed the control group in several test items. Additionally, misconceptions appeared within the C group. The results showed that several hybrid images with a potentially good methodological design might help students to develop conceptual understanding of some important concepts of amino acids and proteins (e.g., formation of peptide bonds). © 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 47(6):644-655, 2019.","['1 Department of Chemistry, Biochemistry and Environmental Protection, Faculty of Sciences, University of Novi Sad, 21000 Novi Sad, Republic of Serbia.', '2 Agricultural High School with dormitory Futog, 21410 Futog, Republic of Serbia.']","Tamara N Rončević, Agneš Sedlar, Dušica D Rodić, Mirjana D Segedinac, ",Biochemistry and molecular biology education : a bimonthly publication of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,2019 Nov,Hybrid images; biomolecules; primary school chemistry education.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31460698
1849,Web-Based Search Tool for Visualizing Instrument Performance Using the Triple Knockout (TKO) Proteome Standard,"Multiplexing strategies are at the forefront of mass-spectrometry-based proteomics, with SPS-MS3 methods becoming increasingly commonplace. A known caveat of isobaric multiplexing is interference resulting from coisolated and cofragmented ions that do not originate from the selected precursor of interest. The triple knockout (TKO) standard was designed to benchmark data collection strategies to minimize interference. However, a limitation to its widespread use has been the lack of an automated analysis platform. We present a TKO Visualization Tool (TVT). The TVT viewer allows for automated, web-based, database searching of the TKO standard, returning traditional figures of merit, such as peptide and protein counts, scan-specific ion accumulation times, as well as the TKO-specific metric, the IFI (interference-free index). Moreover, the TVT viewer allows for plotting of two TKO standards to assess protocol optimizations, compare instruments, or measure degradation of instrument performance over time. We showcase the TVT viewer by probing the selection of (1) stationary phase resin, (2) MS2 isolation window width, and (3) number of synchronous precursor selection (SPS) ions for SPS-MS3 analysis. Using the TVT viewer will allow the proteomics community to search and compare TKO results to optimize user-specific data collection workflows.","['1 Department of Cell Biology , Harvard Medical School , Boston , Massachusetts 02115 , United States.']","Jeremy P Gygi, Qing Yu, Jose Navarrete-Perea, Ramin Rad, Steven P Gygi, Joao A Paulo, ",Journal of proteome research,2019,SPS-MS3; TKO standard; TMT; TVT; iTRAQ; ion interference; shiny application.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30451507
1850,"Comparison of penh, fluka, and Geant4/topas for absorbed dose calculations in air cavities representing ionization chambers in high-energy photon and proton beams","Purpose:
      
    

    
      The purpose of this work is to analyze whether the Monte Carlo codes penh, fluka, and geant4/topas are suitable to calculate absorbed doses and  f Q / f Q 0    ratios in therapeutic high-energy photon and proton beams. Methods:
      
    

    
      We used penh, fluka, geant4/topas, and egsnrc to calculate the absorbed dose to water in a reference water cavity and the absorbed dose to air in two air cavities representative of a plane-parallel and a cylindrical ionization chamber in a 1.25 MeV photon beam and a 150 MeV proton beam - egsnrc was only used for the photon beam calculations. The physics and transport settings in each code were adjusted to simulate the particle transport as detailed as reasonably possible. From these absorbed doses, f Q 0   factors, f Q  factors, and  f Q / f Q 0    ratios (which are the basis of Monte Carlo calculated beam quality correction factors k Q , Q 0    ) were calculated and compared between the codes. Additionally, we calculated the spectra of primary particles and secondary electrons in the reference water cavity, as well as the integrated depth-dose curve of 150 MeV protons in water. Results:
      
    

    
      The absorbed doses agreed within 1.4% or better between the individual codes for both the photon and proton simulations. The f Q 0   and f Q  factors agreed within 0.5% or better for the individual codes for both beam qualities. The resulting  f Q / f Q 0    ratios for 150 MeV protons agreed within 0.7% or better. For the 1.25 MeV photon beam, the spectra of photons and secondary electrons agreed almost perfectly. For the 150 MeV proton simulation, we observed differences in the spectra of secondary protons whereas the spectra of primary protons and low-energy delta electrons also agreed almost perfectly. The first 2 mm of the entrance channel of the 150 MeV proton Bragg curve agreed almost perfectly while for greater depths, the differences in the integrated dose were up to 1.5%. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      penh, fluka, and geant4/topas are capable of calculating beam quality correction factors in proton beams. The differences in the f Q 0   and f Q  factors between the codes are 0.5% at maximum. The differences in the  f Q / f Q 0    ratios are 0.7% at maximum.","['1 Department of Radiotherapy and Radiooncology, University Medical Center Giessen-Marburg, Marburg, Germany.', '2 Institute of Medical Physics and Radiation Protection, University of Applied Sciences, Giessen, Germany.', '3 GSI Helmholtzzentrum für Schwerionenforschung, Darmstadt, Germany.', '4 Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies (FIAS), Frankfurt, Germany.', '5 Department of Oncology, Laboratory of Experimental Radiotherapy, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.']","Kilian-Simon Baumann, Felix Horst, Klemens Zink, Carles Gomà, ",Medical physics,2019 Oct,Monte Carlo simulation; beam quality correction factors; dosimetry; high-energy photon and proton radiation; radiation therapy.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31350915

The undergraduate students in our department are taught to analyze proteomics and metabolomics data obtained from MS analysis, including de novo sequencing of peptides and to interpret the MS and MS/MS data acquired in positive and negative ionization modes. Here, we give some examples of MS data analyzed in the Biochemistry I class and then examples of some independent research projects performed by students over the years in the Biochemistry and Biotechnology laboratory, where MS is used for both proteins, peptides and metabolites analysis, thus demonstrating the applicability of MS analysis in diverse fields.

1854,Proteomic and metabolomic approaches in the search for biomarkers in chronic kidney disease,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an aging-related disorder that represents a major global public health burden. Current biochemical biomarkers, such as serum creatinine and urinary albumin, have important limitations when used to identify the earliest indication of CKD or in tracking the progression to more advanced CKD. These issues underline the importance of finding and testing new molecular biomarkers that are capable of successfully meeting this clinical need. The measurement of changes in nature and/or levels of proteins and metabolites in biological samples from patients provide insights into pathophysiological processes. Proteomic and metabolomic techniques provide opportunities to record dynamic chemical signatures in patients over time. This review article presents an overview of the recent developments in the fields of metabolomics and proteomics in relation to CKD. Among the many different proteomic biomarkers proposed, there is particular interest in the CKD273 classifier, a urinary proteome biomarker reported to predict CKD progression and with implementation potential. Other individual non-invasive peptidomic biomarkers that are potentially relevant for CKD detection include type 1 collagen, uromodulin and mucin-1. Despite the limited sample sizes and variability of the metabolomics studies, some metabolites such as trimethylamine N-oxide, kynurenine and citrulline stand out as potential biomarkers in CKD.","[""1 Epidemiology and Public Health Research Group, Centre for Public Health, Queen's University of Belfast, Regional Genetics Centre, Level A, Tower Block, Belfast City Hospital, Lisburn Road, Belfast BT9 7AB, United Kingdom; Regional Nephrology Unit, Belfast City Hospital, Belfast, United Kingdom.

1855,Impedimetric analysis on the mass transfer properties of intact and competent E. coli cells,"Competent Escherichia coli cells are commonly used in bacterial transformation owing to its high permeability for bioorganic macromolecules like plasmid DNA. However, the mass transfer property of competent E. coli cell has not fully investigated. In the present study, mass transfer coefficients of competent and intact E. coli cells in deionized water were evaluated by impedimetric analysis of the release of cytoplasmic compounds. Because competent cells have a higher permeability after chemical treatment, the lumped mass transfer coefficient of a competent cell was approximately 6.5 times larger than that of an intact cell at room temperature. Release of cytoplasmic components was accelerated at an elevated temperature of 42 °C, which is the heat shock temperature used during bacterial transformation. At this elevated temperature, assessed lumped mass transfer coefficients of intact and competent E. coli cells were 9.28 × 10-4 min-1 and 97.10 × 10-4 min-1, respectively. Significant increase in the mass transfer coefficient of the competent cell is caused by cytolysis of cells. The double layer capacitances were also assessed from the electrochemical spectra confirming the enhanced ion release from E. coli cells and rupture of the competent cell under prolonged exposure at the elevated temperature. Impedimetric detection of the ion release with analyses using an equivalent circuit model provides a method to evaluate mass transfer properties of biomolecules.","['1 Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Yonsei University, 50 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul 03722, Republic of Korea.', '2 Department of Chemical Engineering, National Taiwan University, No.1 Sec. 4 Roosevelt Road, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.', '3 Department of Chemical Engineering, National Taiwan University, No.1 Sec. 4 Roosevelt Road, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.

1856,VSClust: feature-based variance-sensitive clustering of omics data,"Motivation:
      
    

    
      Data clustering is indispensable for identifying biologically relevant molecular features in large-scale omics experiments with thousands of measurements at multiple conditions. Optimal clustering results yield groups of functionally related features that may include genes, proteins and metabolites in biological processes and molecular networks. Omics experiments typically include replicated measurements of each feature within a given condition to statistically assess feature-specific variation. Current clustering approaches ignore this variation by averaging, which often leads to incorrect cluster assignments. Results:
      
    

    
      We present VSClust that accounts for feature-specific variance. Based on an algorithm derived from fuzzy clustering, VSClust unifies statistical testing with pattern recognition to cluster the data into feature groups that more accurately reflect the underlying molecular and functional behavior. We apply VSClust to artificial and experimental datasets comprising hundreds to >80 000 features across 6-20 different conditions including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics experiments. VSClust avoids arbitrary averaging methods, outperforms standard fuzzy c-means clustering and simplifies the data analysis workflow in large-scale omics studies.

1857,BioStruct-Africa: empowering Africa-based scientists through structural biology knowledge transfer and mentoring - recent advances and future perspectives,"Being able to visualize biology at the molecular level is essential for our understanding of the world. A structural biology approach reveals the molecular basis of disease processes and can guide the design of new drugs as well as aid in the optimization of existing medicines. However, due to the lack of a synchrotron light source, adequate infrastructure, skilled persons and incentives for scientists in addition to limited financial support, the majority of countries across the African continent do not conduct structural biology research. Nevertheless, with technological advances such as robotic protein crystallization and remote data collection capabilities offered by many synchrotron light sources, X-ray crystallography is now potentially accessible to Africa-based scientists. This leap in technology led to the establishment in 2017 of BioStruct-Africa, a non-profit organization (Swedish corporate ID: 802509-6689) whose core aim is capacity building for African students and researchers in the field of structural biology with a focus on prevalent diseases in the African continent. The team is mainly composed of, but not limited to, a group of structural biologists from the African diaspora. The members of BioStruct-Africa have taken up the mantle to serve as a catalyst in order to facilitate the information and technology transfer to those with the greatest desire and need within Africa. BioStruct-Africa achieves this by organizing workshops onsite at our partner universities and institutions based in Africa, followed by post-hoc online mentoring of participants to ensure sustainable capacity building. The workshops provide a theoretical background on protein crystallography, hands-on practical experience in protein crystallization, crystal harvesting and cryo-cooling, live remote data collection on a synchrotron beamline, but most importantly the links to drive further collaboration through research. Capacity building for Africa-based researchers in structural biology is crucial to win the fight against the neglected tropical diseases, e.g. ascariasis, hookworm, trichuriasis, lymphatic filariasis, active trachoma, loiasis, yellow fever, leprosy, rabies, sleeping sickness, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis, etc., that constitute significant health, social and economic burdens to the continent.

1861,DecoMetDIA: Deconvolution of Multiplexed MS/MS Spectra for Metabolite Identification in SWATH-MS-Based Untargeted Metabolomics,"SWATH-MS-based data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) technology has been recently developed for untargeted metabolomics due to its capability to acquire all MS2 spectra with high quantitative accuracy. However, software tools for deconvolving multiplexed MS/MS spectra from SWATH-MS with high efficiency and high quality are still lacking in untargeted metabolomics. Here, we developed a new software tool, namely, DecoMetDIA, to deconvolve multiplexed MS/MS spectra for metabolite identification and support the SWATH-based untargeted metabolomics. In DecoMetDIA, multiple model peaks are selected to model the coeluted and unresolved chromatographic peaks of fragment ions in multiplexed spectra and decompose them into a linear combination of the model peaks. DecoMetDIA enabled us to reconstruct the MS2 spectra of metabolites from a variety of different biological samples with high coverages. We also demonstrated that the deconvolved MS2 spectra from DecoMetDIA were of high accuracy through comparison to the experimental MS2 spectra from data-dependent acquisition (DDA). Finally, about 90% of deconvolved MS2 spectra in various biological samples were successfully annotated using software tools such as MetDNA and Sirius. The results demonstrated that the deconvolved MS2 spectra obtained from DecoMetDIA were accurate and valid for metabolite identification and structural elucidation. The comparison of DecoMetDIA to other deconvolution software such as MS-DIAL demonstrated that it performs very well for small polar metabolites.

      A previously published work explored the diversity of some biophysical parameters (colour, elasticity, sebum production, skin microrelief, etc.) of the skin of 1204 Indian women, differently aged, living in four Indian cities (Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata and Mumbai). The present work aimed at completing such research by focusing on possible gender-related differences in the same skin parameters, between Indian men and women living in the same Indian city (Mumbai). Methods:
      
    

    
      A total of 297 Indian men, differently aged (18-70y), were recruited in Mumbai, completing the panel of 303 women who were previously recruited in this same city. The same instrumental measurements of facial skin colour and its homogeneity, its mechanical properties, the sebum production, skin pores size, skin relief, etc. as in the previous work, were conducted. Results:
      
    

    
      Overall, the facial skin colour shows a darker complexion in men as compared to women, on forehead, ocular region, lips, chin and cheek. The skin colour unevenness, which increases with age, was found higher in men, as compared to women. At comparable age, women and men present a same density of skin pores, whereas those of men appear larger, up to 55y. The deepness of Crow's feet wrinkles does not significantly differ between genders. A lesser extensibility was found on the cheeks of men. In men, the sebum production was found significantly higher than that of women at ages above 40y. Conclusions:

To date, SLB preparation has proven challenging because of the need for specialized fabrication equipment, domain-specific knowledge about topics relevant to lipid self-assembly, and extensive training in the interfacial science field. Existing methods, such as vesicle fusion, also work with only a narrow range of lipid compositions and material supports. Here, we describe a recently developed simple and versatile protocol to form SLBs. The protocol is simple because it requires minimal sample preparation and only basic microfluidics, making it technically accessible to researchers across different scientific disciplines. The protocol is versatile because it works on a wide range of material supports, such as silicon oxide, gold, and graphene, and is compatible with diverse lipid compositions, including sterols and signaling lipids. The main stages of the procedure involve dissolving a lipid sample in an organic solvent, depositing the lipid solution on a solid support, and replacing the organic solvent with aqueous buffer. In addition, we provide procedures for characterizing the quality of the prepared SLBs and present examples of biofunctionalization procedures. The protocol takes 1-2 h and is broadly useful in various application contexts, including clinical diagnostics, biosensing, and cellular interfaces.","['1 School of Materials Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore.', '2 School of Chemical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Republic of Korea. jjackman@skku.edu.', '3 School of Materials Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore. njcho@ntu.edu.sg.', '4 School of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore. njcho@ntu.edu.sg.']","Abdul Rahim Ferhan, Bo Kyeong Yoon, Soohyun Park, Tun Naw Sut, Hokyun Chin, Jae Hyeon Park, Joshua A Jackman, Nam-Joon Cho, ",Nature protocols,2019 Jul,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31175346
1865,Detection capability of quantitative faecal immunochemical tests for haemoglobin (FIT) and reporting of low faecal haemoglobin concentrations,"Faecal immunochemical tests for haemoglobin (FIT) are widely used in asymptomatic population screening for colorectal (bowel) cancer. FIT are also used to assist with the assessment of patients presenting with lower abdominal symptoms. Quantitative FIT allow the generation of numerical estimates of faecal haemoglobin (f-Hb) concentrations. There is now great interest in ""low"" f-Hb concentrations in these clinical settings: in consequence, knowledge of the detection capability is very important for f-Hb concentration examinations. There are a number of current problems associated with the reporting of low f-Hb concentrations and wide misunderstanding of the metrological aspects of examinations of f-Hb at low concentrations. These would be solved if the detectability characteristics of f-Hb concentration examinations, namely, the limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ), were generated, validated and used in reporting systems exactly as recommended in the EP17-A2 guideline of the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute. LoB and LoD are statistical concepts, but the LoQ depends on definition of analytical performance specifications (APS). In this Opinion Paper proposals for interim APS are made, based on the current state of the art achieved with examinations of faecal samples. It is proposed that LoQ is determined at an examination imprecision of CV≤10% using faecal samples naturally positive for Hb rather than faeces spiked with haemolysate. Detailed proposals for reporting f-Hb data at low concentrations are also made.","['1 Centre for Research into Cancer Prevention and Screening, University of Dundee, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, Dundee DD1 9SY, Scotland, UK.', '2 NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme, Southern Hub, Royal Surrey County Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Guildford, Surrey, UK.']","Callum G Fraser, Sally C Benton, ",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,2019,detection capability; faecal haemoglobin; faecal immunochemical test; limit of blank; limit of detection; limit of quantitation.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29995629

1868,Bioelectronics of The Cellular Cytoskeleton: Monitoring Cytoskeletal Conductance Variation for Sensing Drug Resistance,"Actin and microtubules form cellular cytoskeletal network, which mediates cell shape, motility and proliferation and are key targets for cancer therapy. Changes in cytoskeletal organization dramatically affect mechanical properties of the cells and correlate with proliferative capacity and invasiveness of cancer cells. Changes in the cytoskeletal network expectedly lead to altered nonmechanical material properties including electrical conductivity as well. Here we applied, for the first time, microtubule and actin based electrical measurement to monitor changes in the electrical properties of breast cancer cells upon administration of anti-tubulin and anti-actin drugs, respectively. Semiconductive behavior of microtubules and conductive behavior of actins presented different bioelectrical responses (in similar frequencies) of the cells treated by anti-tubulin with respect to anti-actin drugs. Doped silicon nanowires were applied as the electrodes due to their enhanced interactive surface and compatibility with electronic fabrication process. We found that treatment with Mebendazole (MBZ), a microtubule destabilizing agent, decreases electrical resistance while treatment with Paclitaxel (PTX), a microtubule stabilizing agent, leads to an increase in electrical resistance. In contrast, actin destabilizing agents, Cytochalasin D (CytD), and actin stabilizing agent, Phalloidin, lead to an increased and decreased electrical resistance, respectively. Our study thus provides proof-of-principle of the usage of determining the electrical function of cytoskeletal compartments in grading of cancer as well as drug resistance assays.","['1 Leiden Academic Centre for Drug Research, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences , Leiden University , 2311 EZ , Leiden , The Netherlands.', '2 ATMP Department, Breast Cancer Research Center , Motamed Cancer Institute, ACECR , P.O.

1870,The physiological and pathological biophysics of phase separation and gelation of RNA binding proteins in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and fronto-temporal lobar degeneration,"Many RNA binding proteins, including FUS, contain moderately repetitive, low complexity, intrinsically disordered domains. These sequence motifs have recently been found to underpin reversible liquid: liquid phase separation and gelation of these proteins, permitting them to reversibly transition from a monodispersed state to liquid droplet- or hydrogel-like states. This function allows the proteins to serve as scaffolds for the formation of reversible membraneless intracellular organelles such as nucleoli, stress granules and neuronal transport granules. Using FUS as an example, this review examines the biophysics of this physiological process, and reports on how mutations and changes in post-translational state alter phase behaviour, and lead to neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration.","['1 Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 0XY, UK; Tanz Centre for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases, and Departments of Medicine, Medical Biophysics and Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3H2, Canada.

In this study, comparison of the effect of identifying and correcting the mistakes in a given set of wrong statements with the effect of studying correct statements individually by graduate medical students on their understanding of the topic ""Cancer Biology"" was carried out. At the end of regular teaching module, students were asked to identify the mistakes in a set of seven incorrect statements and correct them individually without peer consultation. Another set of seven correct statements were also provided to them and were asked to study their significance. The effects on low, medium, and high achievers were evaluated by pre- and post-tests with the same set of Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs). Mean post-test marks were significantly higher among all the three groups compared to pretest marks for the wrong statements given. For the correct statements, the post-test marks were significantly higher than the pretest marks only for the low and medium achievers. The gain from identifying the mistakes was higher than studying the correct statements for all the three groups of students.

1873,Experimental and Monte-Carlo characterization of the novel compact ionization chamber PTW 31023 for reference and relative dosimetry in high energy photon beams,"Introduction:
      
    

    
      The aim of the present work is to perform dosimetric characterization of a novel vented PinPoint ionization chamber (PTW 31023, PTW-Freiburg, Germany). This chamber replaces the previous model (PTW 31014), where the diameter of the central electrode has been increased from 0.3 to 0.6mm and the guard ring has been redesigned. Correction factors for reference and non-reference measurement conditions were examined. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      Measurements and calculations of the correction factors were performed according to the DIN 6800-2. The shifts of the effective point of measurement (EPOM) from the chamber's reference point were determined by comparison of the measured PDD with the reference curve obtained with a Roos chamber. Its lateral dose response functions, which act according to a mathematical convolution model as the convolution kernel transforming the dose profile D(x) to the measured signal M(x), have been approximated by Gaussian functions with standard deviation σ. Additionally, the saturation correction factors kS have been determined using different dose-per-pulse (DPP) values. The polarity effect correction factors kP were measured for field sizes from 5cm×5cm to 40cm×40cm. The influence of the diameter of the central electrode and the new guard ring on the beam quality correction factors kQ was studied by Monte-Carlo simulations. The non-reference condition correction factors kNR have been computed for 6MV photo beam by varying the field size and measurement depth. Comparisons on these aspects have been made to the previous model. Results:
      
    

    
      The shifts of the EPOM from the reference point, Δz, are found to be -0.55 (6MV) and -0.56 (10MV) in the radial orientation and -0.97mm (6MV) and -0.91mm (10MV) in the axial orientation. All values of Δz have an uncertainty of 0.1mm. The σ values are 0.80mm (axial), 0.75mm (radial lateral) and 1.76mm (radial longitudinal) for 6MV photon beam and are 0.85mm (axial), 0.75mm (radial lateral) and 1.82mm (radial longitudinal) for 15MV photon beam. All σ values have an uncertainty of 0.05mm. The correction factor kS was found to be 1.0034±0.0009 for the PTW 31014 chamber and 1.0024±0.0007 for the PTW 31023 chamber at the highest DPP (0.827mGy) investigated in this study. Under reference conditions, the polarity effect correction factor kP of the PTW 31014 chamber is 1.0094 and 1.0116 for 6 and 10MV respectively, while the kP of the PTW 31023 chamber is 1.0005 and 1.0013 for 6 and 10MV respectively, all values have an uncertainty of 0.002. The kP of the new chamber also exhibits a weaker field size dependence. The kQ values of the PTW 31023 chamber are closer to unity than those of the PTW 31014 chamber due to the thicker central electrode and the new guard ring design. The kNR values of the PTW 31023 chamber for 6MV photon beam deviate by not more than 1% from unity for the conditions investigated. Discussions:
      
    

    
      Correction factors associated with the new chamber required to perform reference and relative dose measurements have been determined according to the DIN-protocol. The correction factor kS of the new chamber is 0.1% smaller than that of the PTW 31014 at the highest DPP investigated. Under reference conditions, the correction factor kP of the PTW 31023 chamber is approximately 1% smaller than that of the PTW 31014 chamber for both energies used. The dosimetric characteristics of the new chamber investigated in this work have been demonstrated to fulfil the requirements of the TG-51 addendum for reference-class dosimeters at reference conditions.","['1 University Clinic for Medical Radiation Physics, Medical Campus Pius Hospital, Carl von Ossietzky University, Oldenburg, Germany.

1877,Single-platform 'multi-omic' profiling: unified mass spectrometry and computational workflows for integrative proteomics-metabolomics analysis,"The objective of omics studies is to globally measure the different classes of cellular biomolecules present in a biological specimen (e.g. proteins, metabolites) as accurately as possible in order to investigate the corresponding 'states' of biological systems. High throughput omics technologies are emerging as an increasingly powerful toolkit in the rapidly advancing field of systems biology, enabling the systematic study of dynamic molecular processes that drive core cell functions like growth, sensing, and environmental adaptation. Advances in high resolution mass spectrometry, in particular, now allow for the near comprehensive study of cellular proteins and metabolites that underlie physiological homeostasis and disease pathogenesis. Yet while the expression levels, modification states, and functional associations of diverse molecular species are now measurable, existing proteomic and metabolomic data generation and analysis workflows are often specialized and incompatible. Hence, while there are now many reports of ad hoc combinations of unimolecular proteomic and metabolomic workflows, only a limited number of multi-omic profiling approaches have been reported for obtaining different molecular measurements (proteins, metabolites, nucleic acids) in parallel from a single biological sample. Moreover, elucidating how the myriad of measured cellular components are linked together functionally within the metabolic processes, signal transduction pathways, and macromolecular interaction networks central to living systems remains a massive, complicated, and uncertain endeavor. Presented here is a review of convergent mass spectrometry-based multi-omic methodologies, with a focus on notable recent advances and remaining challenges in terms of efficient sample preparation, biochemical separations, data acquisition, and integrative computational strategies. We outline a unifying network-based integrative framework to better derive biological knowledge from integrated profiling studies with the goal of realizing the full potential of multi-omic data sets.","['1 Center for Network Systems Biology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. aemili@bu.edu.']","Benjamin C Blum, Fatemeh Mousavi, Andrew Emili, ",Molecular omics,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30211418

      Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) as a label-free and powerful imaging technique enables in situ evaluation of a tissue metabolome and/or proteome, becoming increasingly popular in the detection of plant endogenous molecules. Objective:
      
    

    
      The characterisation of structure and spatial information of endogenous molecules in plants are both very important aspects to better understand the physiological mechanism of plant organism. Methods:
      
    

    
      Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) is a commonly-used tissue imaging technique, which requires matrix to assist in situ detection of a variety of molecules on the surface of a tissue section. In previous studies, MALDI-MSI was mostly used for the detection of molecules from animal tissue sections, compared to plant samples due to cell structural limitations, such as plant cuticles, epicuticular waxes, and cell walls. Despite the enormous progress that has been made in tissue imaging, there is still a challenge for MALDI-MSI suitable for the imaging of endogenous compounds in plants. Results:
      
    

    
      This review summarises the recent advances in MALDI-MSI, focusing on the application of in situ detection of endogenous molecules in different plant organs, i.e. root, stem, leaf, flower, fruit, and seed. Conclusion:

      To assess the power profile and in vitro optical quality of scleral contact lenses with different powers as a function of the optical aperture. Methods:
      
    

    
      The mini and semiscleral contact lenses (Procornea) were measured for five powers per design. The NIMO TR-1504 (Lambda-X) was used to assess the power profile and Zernike coefficients of each contact lens. Ten measurements per lens were taken at 3- and 6-mm apertures. Furthermore, the optical quality of each lens was described in Zernike coefficients, modulation transfer function, and point spread function (PSF). A convolution of each lens PSF with an eye-chart image was also computed. Results:
      
    

    
      The optical power fluctuated less than 0.5 diopters (D) along the optical zone of each lens. However, the optical power obtained for some lenses did not match with its corresponding nominal one, the maximum difference being 0.5 D. In optical quality, small differences were obtained among all lenses within the same design. Although significant differences were obtained among lenses (P<0.05), these showed small impact in the image quality of each convolution. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Insignificant power fluctuations were obtained along the optical zone measured for each scleral lens. Additionally, the optical quality of both lenses has showed to be independent of the lens power within the same aperture.","['1 Optometry Research Group (GIO), Department of Optics (A.D.-V., J.J.E.-T., A.R.), University of Valencia, Burjasot, Spain; and Unit of Optometry (R.B.), Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']","Alberto Domínguez-Vicent, Jose Juan Esteve-Taboada, Alberto Recchioni, Rune Brautaset, ",Eye & contact lens,2018 May,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28092274
1880,Zebrafish larvae heartbeat detection from body deformation in low resolution and low frequency video,"Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a powerful animal model used in many areas of genetics and disease research. Despite its advantages for cardiac research, the heartbeat pattern of zebrafish larvae under different stress conditions is not well documented quantitatively. Several effective automated heartbeat detection methods have been developed to reduce the workload for larva heartbeat analysis. However, most require complex experimental setups and necessitate direct observation of the larva heart. In this paper, we propose the Zebrafish Heart Rate Automatic Method (Z-HRAM), which detects and tracks the heartbeats of immobilized, ventrally positioned zebrafish larvae without direct larva heart observation. Z-HRAM tracks localized larva body deformation that is highly correlated with heart movement. Multiresolution dense optical flow-based motion tracking and principal component analysis are used to identify heartbeats. Here, we present results of Z-HRAM on estimating heart rate from video recordings of seizure-induced larvae, which were of low resolution (1024 × 760) and low frame rate (3 to 4 fps). Heartbeats detected from Z-HRAM were shown to correlate reliably with those determined through corresponding electrocardiogram and manual video inspection. We conclude that Z-HRAM is a robust, computationally efficient, and easily applicable tool for studying larva cardiac function in general laboratory conditions.

1881,Developing Well-Annotated Species-Specific Protein Databases Using Comparative Proteogenomics,"Proteomics is a mass spectrometry-based discipline that aims to analyze proteomes and their functions. Many proteomic studies require well-developed protein databases for reference. However, most proteomes are not well-annotated, aside from model organisms. Techniques like six-frame translation, ab initio gene prediction, and EST databases can aid in maximizing the amount of proteins identified in proteomics experiments, however, each of these has its downfalls. Proteogenomics is a term used to describe the union of proteomics, genomics and transcriptomics to assist in the identification of peptides which would help build better annotated proteome databases. Here, current proteomic and proteogenomic methods will be reviewed, and an example of a comparative proteomics method using lake trout liver samples will be described.","['1 Biochemistry & Proteomics Group, Department of Chemistry and Biomolecular Science, Clarkson University, Potsdam, NY, USA.', '2 Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Clarkson University, Potsdam, NY, USA.', '3 AEACS, LLC, New Kensington, PA, USA.', '4 Biochemistry & Proteomics Group, Department of Chemistry and Biomolecular Science, Clarkson University, Potsdam, NY, USA. cdarie@clarkson.edu.']","Emmalyn J Dupree, Bernard S Crimmins, Thomas M Holsen, Costel C Darie, ",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,2019,Evolutionary proteomics; Fish; Lake trout; Protein database; Proteogenomics.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31347060
1882,Anodic versus cathodic neurostimulation of the subthalamic nucleus: A randomized-controlled study of acute clinical effects,"Introduction:
      
    

    
      Stimulation settings of deep brain stimulation (DBS) have evolved empirically within a limited parameter space dictated by first generation devices. There is a need for controlled clinical studies, which evaluate efficacy and safety of established programming practice against novel programming options provided by modern neurostimulation devices. Methods:
      
    

    
      Here, we tested a polarity reversal from conventional monopolar cathodic to anodic stimulation in an acute double-blind, randomized, cross-over study in patients with PD implanted with bilateral STN DBS. The primary outcome measure was the difference between efficacy and side-effect thresholds (current amplitude, mA) in a monopolar review and the severity of motor symptoms (as assessed by MDS-UPDRS III ratings) after 30 min of continuous stimulation in the medication off-state. Results:
      
    

    
      Effect and side effect thresholds were significantly higher with anodic compared to cathodic stimulation (3.36 ± 1.58 mA vs. 1.99 ± 1.37 mA; 6.05 ± 1.52 mA vs. 4.15 ± 1.13 mA; both p < 0.0001). However, using a predefined amplitude of 0.5 mA below the respective adverse effect threshold, blinded MDS-UPDRS-III-ratings were significantly lower with anodic stimulation (anodic: median 17 [min: 12, max: 25]; cathodic: 23 [12, 37]; p < 0.005). Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Effective anodic stimulation requires a higher charge injection into the tissue, but may provide a better reduction of off-period motor symptoms within the individual therapeutic window. Therefore, a programming change to anodic stimulation may be considered in patients suffering from residual off-period motor symptoms of PD despite reaching the adverse effect threshold of cathodic stimulation in the subthalamic nucleus.","['1 Department of Neurology, University-Hospital of Würzburg, Josef-Schneider-Straße 11, 97080 Würzburg, Germany.', '2 Movement Disorders Institute and Department of Neurology, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer 5262101, Israel; Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Israel.', '3 Department of Neurosurgery, University-Hospital of Würzburg, Josef-Schneider-Straße 11, 97080 Würzburg, Germany.', '4 Department of Neurology, University-Hospital of Würzburg, Josef-Schneider-Straße 11, 97080 Würzburg, Germany.

1883,An Integrative Review of Empirical Research on Perceptions and Behaviors Related to Prescribed Burning and Wildfire in the United States,"Social science research from a variety of disciplines has generated a collective understanding of how individuals prepare for, and respond to, the risks associated with prescribed burning and wildfire. We provide a systematic compilation, review, and quantification of dominant trends in this literature by collecting all empirical research conducted within the U.S. that has addressed perceptions and behaviors surrounding various aspects of prescribed burning and wildfire. We reviewed and quantified this literature using four thematic categories covering: (1) the theory and methods that have been used in previous research; (2) the psychosocial aspects of prescribed burning and wildfire that have been studied; (3) the biophysical characteristics of the fires which have been studied; and (4) the types of fire and management approaches that have been examined. Our integrative review builds on previous literature reviews on the subject by offering new insight on the dominant trends, underutilized approaches, and under-studied topics within each thematic category. For example, we found that a select set of theories (e.g., Protection Motivation Theory, Attribution Theory, etc.) and approaches (e.g., mixed-methods) have only been used sparingly in previous research, even though these theories and approaches can produce insightful results that can readily be implemented by fire-management professionals and decision makers. By identifying trends and gaps in the literature across the thematic categories, we were able to answer four questions that address how future research can make the greatest contribution to our understanding of perceptions and behaviors related to prescribed burning and wildfire.","['1 Department of Environment and Society, Utah State University, 5215 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT, 84322-5215, USA.', '2 Department of Environment and Society, Utah State University, 5215 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT, 84322-5215, USA. jordan.smith@usu.edu.']","Lauren Nicole Dupéy, Jordan W Smith, ",Environmental management,2018 Jun,Collaborative management; Integrative review; Mitigation behaviors; Mixed-methods; Risk perceptions; Social theory.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29572559

The most widely implemented of these include metabolomics, proteomics, genomics, and transcriptomics. In recent years, a similar approach has also been taken with the analysis of volatiles from biological samples, giving rise to the so-called 'volatilomics' in plant analysis. Developments in direct infusion mass spectrometry (DI-MS) techniques have made it possible to monitor the changes in the composition of volatile flux from parts of plants, single specimens, and entire ecosystems in real-time. The application of these techniques enables a unique insight into the dynamic metabolic processes that occur in plants.

1886,A BIOPHYSICAL ANALYSIS TO ASSESS X-RAY SENSITIVITY OF HEALTHY AND TUMOUR CELLS,"The mechanobiology is providing novel perspectives in the study of cancer and is contributing to evaluate the cancer responses, from a biophysical point of view, to classical therapeutic approaches- radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Here we have explored the effects of two doses (4 and 8 Gy) of 6 MeV photons on spreading, focal adhesions, migration and mechanical properties of BALB/c 3T3 and their SV40 transformed equivalent, SVT2. Cell biophysical responses to 4 and 8 Gy were analysed and compared with those reported in previous published work when lower doses (1 and 2 Gy) were administered Panzetta et al. (Effects of high energy X-rays on cell morphology and functions. Proc. Book 2017;16:116). We observed that the range of sensitivity to ionising radiations profoundly changes depending on the patho-physiological state of cells. In particular, we found that X-rays induce morphological and functional variations in both cell lines (decreased motility, increased adhesion and increased cytoskeleton stiffness). These changes were slightly dependent on doses in the case of SVT2 cells and may indicate a possible mechanical normalisation in their phenotype. Nevertheless, the responses of BALB/c 3T3 were negligible only for the low dose of 1 Gy and increased significantly in a dose-dependent manner with higher doses. We believe that the characterisation of X-rays effects on the cell mechanobiology could shed new light in the design and customisation of radiotherapy treatments.","['1 Centro Interdipartimentale di Ricerca sui Biomateriali, University of Naples Federico II.', '2 Physics Department, University of Naples Federico II.', '3 Department for BioMedical Research, University of Bern.', '4 IIT-Center for Advanced Biomaterials for Healthcare, Naples.']","V Panzetta, M G Pugliese, I Musella, M De Menna, P A Netti, S Fusco, ",Radiation protection dosimetry,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30668835

In that respect, he ascertained that paralytic poliomyelitis was due to a virus, the pancreas was damaged in cystic fibrosis, simple chemicals called haptens were able to combine with antibodies, and the Rh antigen that was later found to be the principal cause of hemolytic anemia of the newborn was found in most humans. Moreover, Landsteiner's book ""The Specificity of Serological Reactions"" was a precursor to the molecular revolution in immunology that occurred after Second World War.

1891,Supra-threshold perception and neural representation of tones presented in noise in conditions of masking release,"The neural representation and perceptual salience of tonal signals presented in different noise maskers were investigated. The properties of the maskers and signals were varied such that they produced different amounts of either monaural masking release, binaural masking release, or a combination of both. The signals were then presented at different levels above their corresponding masked thresholds and auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) were measured. It was found that, independent of the masking condition, the amplitude of the P2 component of the AEP was similar for the same stimulus levels above masked threshold, suggesting that both monaural and binaural effects of masking release were represented at the level of the auditory pathway where P2 is generated. The perceptual salience of the signal was evaluated at equal levels above masked threshold using a rating task. In contrast to the electrophysiological findings, the subjective ratings of the perceptual signal salience were less consistent with the signal level above masked threshold and varied strongly across listeners and masking conditions. Overall, the results from the present study suggest that the P2 amplitude of the AEP represents an objective indicator of the audibility of a target signal in the presence of complex acoustic maskers.","['1 Hearing Systems Section, Department of Health Technology, Technical University of Denmark, Kgs.

Some fluorescence measurements are still conducted on CMOS chips with the decay times determined after reading the data off the chip and fitting the fluorescence decay histogram. We present a novel approach in which an analog CMOS chip divides the fluorescence decay time into slices and classifies the photons according to their arrival times at a CMOS SPAD sensor. The chip was fabricated in a 1P6M 0.18 μm HV-CMOS process. The slice timings can be tailored from 168 ps to 4.9 ns, covering most fluorescence decay times. 9 timing windows are generated per pixel that count up to 13 b each, with a resolution of 0.16 mV/photon, for a maximum output voltage of 1.3 V, in an area of 150 μm × 50 μm. Here, we report on the first practical application of this circuit, which integrates an array of 5 pixels in a single chip and has an excitation light and a microfluidic chip of up to 3 channels.

1898,The Next Frontier: Quantitative Biochemistry in Living Cells,"Researchers striving to convert biology into an exact science foremost rely on structural biology and biochemical reconstitution approaches to obtain quantitative data. However, cell biological research is moving at an ever-accelerating speed into areas where these approaches lose much of their edge. Intrinsically unstructured proteins and biochemical interaction networks composed of interchangeable, multivalent, and unspecific interactions pose unique challenges to quantitative biology, as do processes that occur in discrete cellular microenvironments. Here we argue that a conceptual change in our way of conducting biochemical experiments is required to take on these new challenges. We propose that reconstitution of cellular processes in vitro should be much more focused on mimicking the cellular environment in vivo, an approach that requires detailed knowledge of the material properties of cellular compartments, essentially requiring a material science of the cell. In a similar vein, we suggest that quantitative biochemical experiments in vitro should be accompanied by corresponding experiments in vivo, as many newly relevant cellular processes are highly context-dependent. In essence, this constitutes a call for chemical biologists to convert their discipline from a proof-of-principle science to an area that could rightfully be called quantitative biochemistry in living cells. In this essay, we discuss novel techniques and experimental strategies with regard to their potential to fulfill such ambitious aims.","['1 Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics , Pfotenhauerstraße 108, 01307 Dresden, Germany.']","Alf Honigmann, André Nadler, ",Biochemistry,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29200271

1900,Impact of anti-charge sharing on the zero-frequency detective quantum efficiency of CdTe-based photon counting detector system: cascaded systems analysis and experimental validation,"Inter-pixel communication and anti-charge sharing (ACS) technologies have been introduced to photon counting detector (PCD) systems to address the undesirable charge sharing problem. In addition to improving the energy resolution of PCD, ACS may also influence other aspects of PCD performance such as detector multiplicity (i.e. the number of pixels triggered by each interacted photon) and detective quantum efficiency (DQE). In this work, a theoretical model was developed to address how ACS impacts the multiplicity and zero-frequency DQE [DQE(0)] of PCD systems. The work focused on cadmium telluride (CdTe)-based PCD that often involves the generation and transport of K-fluorescence photons. Under the parallel cascaded systems analysis framework, the theory takes both photoelectric and scattering effects into account, and it also considers both the reabsorption and escape of photons. In a new theoretical treatment of ACS, it was considered as a modified version of the conventional single pixel (i.e. non-ACS) mode, but with reduced charge spreading distance and K-fluorescence travel distance. The proposed theoretical model does not require prior knowledge of the detailed ACS implementation method for each specific PCD, and its parameters can be experimentally determined using a radioisotope without invoking any Monte-Carlo simulation. After determining the model parameters, independent validation experiments were performed using a diagnostic x-ray tube and four different polychromatic beams (from 50 to 120 kVp). Both the theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that ACS increased the first and second moments of multiplicity for a majority of the x-ray energy and threshold levels tested, except when the threshold level was much lower than the x-ray energy level. However, ACS always improved DQE(0) at all energy and threshold levels tested.","['1 Department of Medical Physics, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1111 Highland Avenue, Madison, WI 53705, United States of America.']","Xu Ji, Ran Zhang, Guang-Hong Chen, Ke Li, ",Physics in medicine and biology,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29582785

These computational organ and cell models can be used to study the impact of pharmaceutical drugs, test hypotheses, assess risk and for closed-loop validation of medical devices. To move closer to the real-time requirements of this modeling a new flexible Fourier based general membrane potential model, called as a Resonant model, is developed that is computationally inexpensive. The new model accurately reproduces non-linear potential morphologies for a variety of cell types. Specifically, the method is used to model human and rabbit sinoatrial node, human ventricular myocyte and squid giant axon electrophysiology. The Resonant models are validated with experimental data and with other published models. Dynamic changes in biological conditions are modeled with changing model coefficients and this approach enables ionic channel alterations to be captured. The Resonant model is used to simulate entrainment between competing sinoatrial node cells. These models can be easily implemented in low-cost digital hardware and an alternative, resource-efficient implementations of sine and cosine functions are presented and it is shown that a Fourier term is produced with two additions and a binary shift.","['1 Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Auckland, Auckland 1010, New Zealand.', '2 Auckland Bioengineering Institute, The University of Auckland, Auckland 1010, New Zealand.']","Sucheta Sehgal, Nitish D Patel, Avinash Malik, Partha S Roop, Mark L Trew, ",PloS one,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31116780
1902,Aerrow: A probe-format graphite calorimeter for absolute dosimetry of high-energy photon beams in the clinical environment,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      In this work, the design, operation, initial experimental evaluation, and characterization of a small-scale graphite calorimeter probe - herein referred to as the Aerrow - developed for routine use in the clinical environment, are described. Similar in size and shape to a Farmer type cylindrical ionization chamber, the Aerrow represents the first translation of calorimetry intended for direct use by clinical physicists in the radiotherapy clinic. Methods:
      
    

    
      Based on a numerically optimized design obtained in previous work, a functioning Aerrow prototype capable of two independent modes of operation (quasi-adiabatic and isothermal) was constructed in-house. Reference dose measurements were performed using both Aerrow operation modes in a 6 MV photon beam and were directly compared to results obtained with a calibrated reference-class ionization chamber. The Aerrow was then used to quantify the absolute output of five clinical linac-based photon beams (6 MV, 6 MV FFF, 10 MV, 10 MV FFF, and 15 MV; 63.2% < %dd(10)× < 76.3%). Linearity, dose rate, and orientation dependences were also investigated. Results:
      
    

    
      Compared to an ion chamber-derived dose to water of 76.3 ± 0.7 cGy, the average doses measured using the Aerrow were 75.6 ± 0.7 and 74.7 ± 0.7 cGy/MU for the quasi-adiabatic and isothermal modes, respectively. All photon beam output measurements using the Aerrow in water-equivalent phantom agreed with chamber-based clinical reference dosimetry data within combined standard uncertainties. The linearity of the Aerrow's response was characterized by an adjusted R2 value of 0.9998 in the dose range of 80 cGy to 470 cGy. For the dose-rate dependence, no statistically significant effects were observed in the range of 0.5 Gy/min to 5.4 Gy/min. A relative photon beam quality dependence of 1.7% was calculated in the range of 60 Co to 24 MV (58.4% < %dd(10)× < 86.8%) using Monte Carlo. Finally, the angular dependence (gantry stationary and detector rotated) of the Aerrow's response was found to be insignificant to within ±0.5%. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      This work demonstrates the feasibility of using an ion chamber-sized calorimeter as a practical means of measuring absolute dose to water in the radiotherapy clinic. The potential introduction of calorimetry as a mainstream device into the clinical setting is powerful, as this fundamental technique has formed the basis of absorbed dose standards in many countries for decades and could one day form the basis of a new local absorbed dose standard for clinics.","['1 Medical Physics Unit, McGill University, Montréal, QC, Canada.', '2 Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.']","James Renaud, Arman Sarfehnia, Julien Bancheri, Jan Seuntjens, ",Medical physics,2018 Jan,absolute dosimetry; calorimetry; ionization chambers; medical device; reference dosimetry.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29131344
1903,Searching for the neurite density with diffusion MRI: Challenges for biophysical modeling,"In vivo mapping of the neurite density with diffusion MRI (dMRI) is a high but challenging aim. First, it is unknown whether all neurites exhibit completely anisotropic (""stick-like"") diffusion. Second, the ""density"" of tissue components may be confounded by non-diffusion properties such as T2 relaxation. Third, the domain of validity for the estimated parameters to serve as indices of neurite density is incompletely explored. We investigated these challenges by acquiring data with ""b-tensor encoding"" and multiple echo times in brain regions with low orientation coherence and in white matter lesions. Results showed that microscopic anisotropy from b-tensor data is associated with myelinated axons but not with dendrites. Furthermore, b-tensor data together with data acquired for multiple echo times showed that unbiased density estimates in white matter lesions require data-driven estimates of compartment-specific T2 values. Finally, the ""stick"" fractions of different biophysical models could generally not serve as neurite density indices across the healthy brain and white matter lesions, where outcomes of comparisons depended on the choice of constraints. In particular, constraining compartment-specific T2 values was ambiguous in the healthy brain and had a large impact on estimated values. In summary, estimating neurite density generally requires accounting for different diffusion and/or T2 properties between axons and dendrites.

1904,Explaining the heterogeneity of functional connectivity findings in multiple sclerosis: An empirically informed modeling study,"To understand the heterogeneity of functional connectivity results reported in the literature, we analyzed the separate effects of grey and white matter damage on functional connectivity and networks in multiple sclerosis. For this, we employed a biophysical thalamo-cortical model consisting of interconnected cortical and thalamic neuronal populations, informed and amended by empirical diffusion MRI tractography data, to simulate functional data that mimic neurophysiological signals. Grey matter degeneration was simulated by decreasing within population connections and white matter degeneration by lowering between population connections, based on lesion predilection sites in multiple sclerosis. For all simulations, functional connectivity and functional network organization are quantified by phase synchronization and network integration, respectively. Modeling results showed that both cortical and thalamic grey matter damage induced a global increase in functional connectivity, whereas white matter damage induced an initially increased connectivity followed by a global decrease. Both white and especially grey matter damage, however, induced a decrease in network integration. These empirically informed simulations show that specific topology and timing of structural damage are nontrivial aspects in explaining functional abnormalities in MS. Insufficient attention to these aspects likely explains contradictory findings in multiple sclerosis functional imaging studies so far.","['1 Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', '2 Department of Neurology, Amsterdam Neuroscience, VUmc MS Center Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', '3 Department of Anatomy and Neurosciences, Amsterdam Neuroscience, VUmc MS Center Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', '4 Department of Clinical Neurophysiology and MEG center, Amsterdam Neuroscience, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.']","Prejaas Tewarie, Martijn D Steenwijk, Matthew J Brookes, Bernard M J Uitdehaag, Jeroen J G Geurts, Cornelis J Stam, Menno M Schoonheim, ",Human brain mapping,2018 Jun,biophysical modeling; functional connectivity; functional networks; grey matter damage; multiple sclerosis; white matter damage.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29468785
1905,meaRtools: An R package for the analysis of neuronal networks recorded on microelectrode arrays,"Here we present an open-source R package 'meaRtools' that provides a platform for analyzing neuronal networks recorded on Microelectrode Arrays (MEAs). Cultured neuronal networks monitored with MEAs are now being widely used to characterize in vitro models of neurological disorders and to evaluate pharmaceutical compounds. meaRtools provides core algorithms for MEA spike train analysis, feature extraction, statistical analysis and plotting of multiple MEA recordings with multiple genotypes and treatments. meaRtools functionality covers novel solutions for spike train analysis, including algorithms to assess electrode cross-correlation using the spike train tiling coefficient (STTC), mutual information, synchronized bursts and entropy within cultured wells. Also integrated is a solution to account for bursts variability originating from mixed-cell neuronal cultures. The package provides a statistical platform built specifically for MEA data that can combine multiple MEA recordings and compare extracted features between different genetic models or treatments. We demonstrate the utilization of meaRtools to successfully identify epilepsy-like phenotypes in neuronal networks from Celf4 knockout mice.

1906,Do all the linear accelerators comply with the ICRU 91's constraints for stereotactic body radiation therapy treatments?,"Recent technological developments in linear accelerators (linacs) and their imaging systems have made it possible to routinely perform stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) treatments. To ensure the security and quality of the treatments, national and international recommendations have been written. This review focuses on the recommendations of the report 91 of the International Commission on Radiation Units (ICRU) on stereotactic treatments with small photon beams and proposes to answer the question of the eligibility of the commercially available accelerators for the treatment of extra-cranial SRT (SBRT). The ICRU 91 report outlines important features needed to respect the constraints, which are high intensity photon beam, integrated image-guidance, high mechanical accuracy of the linac, multileaf collimator with reduced leaf width, bundled motion management and bundled 6 Dimensional ""robotic"" couch tabletop. Most of the contemporary linacs meet these recommendations, in particular, stereotactic dedicated linacs, or modern gantry-based linacs equipped with 3 dimensional cone-beam CT imaging and 2D-stereoscopic planar imaging. Commercially available ring-based linacs have some limitations: they offer only coplanar treatments, and couch movements are limited to translations and, some have limited imaging equipment and no ability to manage intrafraction motion. However, for performing SBRT, non-coplanar irradiations are not mandatory, contrarily to intracranial stereotactic irradiations. Furthermore, patients' rotations can be corrected, thanks to real-time adaptive radiotherapy available on MRI-linacs. Finally, significant improvements are expected in the short term to compensate the weaknesses of the current devices.","['1 Léon Bérard Cancer Center, University of Lyon, 69373 Lyon, France; Université de Lyon, CREATIS, CNRS UMR5220, Inserm U1044, INSA, 69622 Lyon, France.

1907,Using GPUs to accelerate computational diffusion MRI: From microstructure estimation to tractography and connectomes,"The great potential of computational diffusion MRI (dMRI) relies on indirect inference of tissue microstructure and brain connections, since modelling and tractography frameworks map diffusion measurements to neuroanatomical features. This mapping however can be computationally highly expensive, particularly given the trend of increasing dataset sizes and the complexity in biophysical modelling. Limitations on computing resources can restrict data exploration and methodology development. A step forward is to take advantage of the computational power offered by recent parallel computing architectures, especially Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). GPUs are massive parallel processors that offer trillions of floating point operations per second, and have made possible the solution of computationally-intensive scientific problems that were intractable before. However, they are not inherently suited for all problems. Here, we present two different frameworks for accelerating dMRI computations using GPUs that cover the most typical dMRI applications: a framework for performing biophysical modelling and microstructure estimation, and a second framework for performing tractography and long-range connectivity estimation. The former provides a front-end and automatically generates a GPU executable file from a user-specified biophysical model, allowing accelerated non-linear model fitting in both deterministic and stochastic ways (Bayesian inference). The latter performs probabilistic tractography, can generate whole-brain connectomes and supports new functionality for imposing anatomical constraints, such as inherent consideration of surface meshes (GIFTI files) along with volumetric images. We validate the frameworks against well-established CPU-based implementations and we show that despite the very different challenges for parallelising these problems, a single GPU achieves better performance than 200 CPU cores thanks to our parallel designs.","['1 Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging - Centre for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain (FMRIB), University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom; Center for Biomedical Image Computing and Analytics (CBICA), Department of Radiology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.

A classroom activity was developed based on learning theory and evidence-based practices, combining protein visualization with thermodynamic parameters from differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) data analysis. Coding of student responses showed that many students were able to establish the desired connections among protein structure, thermodynamic parameters, and experimental data analysis, while a few did not recognize all the differences between the folded and unfolded forms of the protein. The activity elicits student prior knowledge through the pre-class activity, has the students examine the interactions within a protein molecule through the PyMOL activity, introduces DSF analysis using the learning cycle through the Guided Inquiry activity, and tests student learning through the post-class activity.

1909,"Radiological properties of healthy, carcinoma and equivalent breast tissues for photon and charged particle interactions","Purpose:
      
    

    
      In this paper, the effective atomic numbers (Zeff), electron densities (Neff), exposure buildup factor (EBF) and energy absorption buildup factor (EABF) of healthy (H), carcinoma (C) and equivalent (E) breast tissues were investigated to quantify differences in radiological parameters between the tissues in the continuous energy region. For these purposes, Zeffs and Neffs, of healthy, carcinoma and equivalent (H-C-E) breast tissues were calculated for interaction of gamma rays and charged particles with selected tissues. EBFs and EABFs of the tissues were also calculated for gamma rays as well and were compared to each other for different photon energies (0.015-15 MeV) up to 40 mfp. Method:
      
    

    
      A well-known interpolation procedure has been used for the calculation of Zeff using the mass stopping powers and mass attenuation coefficients for charged and uncharged radiations in the continuous energy region. And the buildup factors of the tissues were calculated by the well-known G-P fitting method based on the interpolation from the equivalent atomic number (Zeq). Results:
      
    

    
      The variation of Zeffs, Neffs with energy and differences (%) in the Zeffs between the tissues were determined for photon, electron, proton and C ion, which is commonly used in hadron therapy in the relevant energy region 1 keV-400 MeV. Differences (%) between healthy and carcinoma tissues in Zeff were around 9%, >4%, >5%, >2.5% for C ion, photon, electron and proton interaction, respectively. The relative differences (RD %) in Zeff between healthy and equivalent tissues in the energy range 0.02-1 MeV were found to be less than 1% for photons and C ions. In addition differences (%) between healthy and carcinoma tissues in EABF and EBF were around 25%, but differences (%) between healthy and equivalent tissues were <6% and <4% (at 40 mfp) in the continuous energy region. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      From the results, BR12 was found the be available for an equivalent to healthy breast tissue in 0.02-1 MeV for photons and C ions due to RD (%) in Zeff between healthy and equivalent tissues (less than 1%). However, for electron interaction, the RD (%) in Zeff between healthy and equivalent tissues was always greater than 4% in the entire energy range, thus BR12 was found the worse an equivalent to healthy breast tissue in in the entire energy range for electron. Also the reported data in the study should be useful to choose best equivalence for photon, electron, proton and Carbon ion interactions.","['1 a Faculty of Engineering, Department of Electrical and Electronics , Yalova University , Yalova , Turkey.', '2 b Faculty of Science, Department of Physics , Ataturk University , Erzurum , Turkey.']","Mehmet Büyükyıldız, Murat Kurudirek, ",International journal of radiation biology,2018 Jan,Effective atomic number; buildup factor; electron and hadron interactions; electron density; photon interaction.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29119856
1910,A Low-Cost Mechanical Stretching Device for Uniaxial Strain of Cells: A Platform for Pedagogy in Mechanobiology,"Mechanical cues including stretch, compression, and shear stress play a critical role in regulating the behavior of many cell types, particularly those that experience substantial mechanical stress within tissues. Devices that impart mechanical stimulation to cells in vitro have been instrumental in helping to develop a better understanding of how cells respond to mechanical forces. However, these devices often have constraints, such as cost and limited functional capabilities, that restrict their use in research or educational environments. Here, we describe a low-cost method to fabricate a uniaxial cell stretcher that would enable widespread use and facilitate engineering design and mechanobiology education for undergraduate students. The device is capable of producing consistent and reliable strain profiles through the use of a servomotor, gear, and gear rack system. The servomotor can be programmed to output various waveforms at specific frequencies and stretch amplitudes by controlling the degree of rotation, speed, and acceleration of the servogear. In addition, the stretchable membranes are easy to fabricate and can be customized, allowing for greater flexibility in culture well size. We used the custom-built stretching device to uniaxially strain macrophages and cardiomyocytes, and found that both cell types displayed functional and cell shape changes that were consistent with the previous studies using commercially available systems. Overall, this uniaxial cell stretcher provides a more cost-effective alternative to study the effects of mechanical stretch on cells, and can therefore, be widely used in research and educational environments to broaden the study and pedagogy of cell mechanobiology.","['1 Department of Biomedical Engineering, The Edwards Lifesciences Center for Advanced Cardiovascular Technology, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697.', '2 Department of Biomedical Engineering, Center for Complex Biological Systems, The Edwards Lifesciences Center for Advanced Cardiovascular Technology, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697.', '3 Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697 e-mail:\u2002.']","Hamza Atcha, Chase T Davis, Nicholas R Sullivan, Tim D Smith, Sara Anis, Waleed Z Dahbour, Zachery R Robinson, Anna Grosberg, Wendy F Liu, ",Journal of biomechanical engineering,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30003248
1911,Feasibility of using a dose-area product ratio as beam quality specifier for photon beams with small field sizes,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      To investigate the feasibility of using the ratio of dose-area product at 20 cm and 10 cm water depths (DAPR20,10) as a beam quality specifier for radiotherapy photon beams with field diameter below 2 cm. Methods:
      
    

    
      Dose-area product was determined as the integral of absorbed dose to water (Dw) over a surface larger than the beam size. 6 MV and 10 MV photon beams with field diameters from 0.75 cm to 2 cm were considered. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations were performed to calculate energy-dependent dosimetric parameters and to study the DAPR20,10 properties. Aspects relevant to DAPR20,10 measurement were explored using large-area plane-parallel ionization chambers with different diameters. Results:
      
    

    
      DAPR20,10 was nearly independent of field size in line with the small differences among the corresponding mean beam energies. Both MC and experimental results showed a dependence of DAPR20,10 on the measurement setup and the surface over which Dw is integrated. For a given setup, DAPR20,10 values obtained using ionization chambers with different air-cavity diameters agreed with one another within 0.4%, after the application of MC correction factors accounting for effects due to the chamber size. DAPR20,10 differences among the small field sizes were within 1% and sensitivity to the beam energy resulted similar to that of established beam quality specifiers based on the point measurement of Dw. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      For a specific measurement setup and integration area, DAPR20,10 proved suitable to specify the beam quality of small photon beams for the selection of energy-dependent dosimetric parameters.","['1 Istituto Nazionale di Metrologia delle Radiazioni Ionizzanti, ENEA-INMRI, I-00123 Roma, Italy.

1912,Deep tissue space-gated microscopy via acousto-optic interaction,"To extend the imaging depth of high-resolution optical microscopy, various gating operations-confocal, coherence, and polarization gating-have been devised to filter out the multiply scattered wave. However, the imaging depth is still limited by the multiply scattered wave that bypasses the existing gating operations. Here, we present a space gating method, whose mechanism is independent of the existing methods and yet effective enough to complement them. Specifically, we reconstruct an image only using the ballistic wave that is acousto-optically modulated at the object plane. The space gating suppresses the multiply scattered wave by 10-100 times in a highly scattering medium, and thus enables visualization of the skeletal muscle fibers in whole-body zebrafish at 30 days post fertilization. The space gating will be an important addition to optical-resolution microscopy for achieving the ultimate imaging depth set by the detection limit of ballistic wave.","['1 Center for Molecular Spectroscopy and Dynamics, Institute for Basic Science (IBS), 145 Anam-ro, Seongbuk-gu, Seoul, 02841, Korea. mooseok@kaist.ac.kr.', '2 Department of Physics, Korea University, 145 Anam-ro, Seongbuk-gu, Seoul, 02841, Korea. mooseok@kaist.ac.kr.', '3 Department of Bio and Brain Engineering, KAIST, 291 Daehak-ro, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, 34141, Korea. mooseok@kaist.ac.kr.', '4 Center for Molecular Spectroscopy and Dynamics, Institute for Basic Science (IBS), 145 Anam-ro, Seongbuk-gu, Seoul, 02841, Korea.', '5 Department of Physics, Korea University, 145 Anam-ro, Seongbuk-gu, Seoul, 02841, Korea.', '6 Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Korea University, 145 Anam-ro, Seongbuk-gu, Seoul, 02841, Korea.', '7 Center for Molecular Spectroscopy and Dynamics, Institute for Basic Science (IBS), 145 Anam-ro, Seongbuk-gu, Seoul, 02841, Korea. wonshik@korea.ac.kr.', '8 Department of Physics, Korea University, 145 Anam-ro, Seongbuk-gu, Seoul, 02841, Korea. wonshik@korea.ac.kr.']","Mooseok Jang, Hakseok Ko, Jin Hee Hong, Won Kyu Lee, Jae-Seung Lee, Wonshik Choi, ",Nature communications,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32024847
1913,Accurate signal-source localization in brain slices by means of high-density microelectrode arrays,"Extracellular recordings by means of high-density microelectrode arrays (HD-MEAs) have become a powerful tool to resolve subcellular details of single neurons in active networks grown from dissociated cells. To extend the application of this technology to slice preparations, we developed models describing how extracellular signals, produced by neuronal cells in slices, are detected by microelectrode arrays. The models help to analyze and understand the electrical-potential landscape in an in vitro HD-MEA-recording scenario based on point-current sources. We employed two modeling schemes, (i) a simple analytical approach, based on the method of images (MoI), and (ii) an approach, based on finite-element methods (FEM). We compared and validated the models with large-scale, high-spatiotemporal-resolution recordings of slice preparations by means of HD-MEAs. We then developed a model-based localization algorithm and compared the performance of MoI and FEM models. Both models provided accurate localization results and a comparable and negligible systematic error, when the point source was in saline, a condition similar to cell-culture experiments. Moreover, the relative random error in the x-y-z-localization amounted only up to 4.3% for z-distances up to 200 μm from the HD-MEA surface. In tissue, the systematic errors of both, MoI and FEM models were significantly higher, and a pre-calibration was required. Nevertheless, the FEM values proved to be closer to the tissue experimental results, yielding 5.2 μm systematic mean error, compared to 22.0 μm obtained with MoI. These results suggest that the medium volume or ""saline height"", the brain slice thickness and anisotropy, and the location of the reference electrode, which were included in the FEM model, considerably affect the extracellular signal and localization performance, when the signal source is at larger distance to the array. After pre-calibration, the relative random error of the z-localization in tissue was only 3% for z-distances up to 200 μm. We then applied the model and related detailed understanding of extracellular recordings to achieve an electrically-guided navigation of a stimulating micropipette, solely based on the measured HD-MEA signals, and managed to target spontaneously active neurons in an acute brain slice for electroporation.","['1 Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering, ETH Zurich, Basel, Switzerland. marie.obien@bsse.ethz.ch.', '2 RIKEN Quantitative Biology Center, Kobe, Japan. marie.obien@bsse.ethz.ch.', '3 MaxWell Biosystems AG, Basel, Switzerland. marie.obien@bsse.ethz.ch.', '4 Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering, ETH Zurich, Basel, Switzerland.', '5 RIKEN Quantitative Biology Center, Kobe, Japan.', '6 MaxWell Biosystems AG, Basel, Switzerland.']","Marie Engelene J Obien, Andreas Hierlemann, Urs Frey, ",Scientific reports,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30692552

Here we consider a novel topological configuration in which a closed filament loop, known as a scroll ring, is threaded by a pair of counterrotating filaments that are perpendicular to the plane of the ring and end on the boundary of a thin medium. We simulate the dynamics of this threaded ring (thring) in the photosensitive Belousov-Zhabotinsky excitable medium, using the modified Oregonator reaction-diffusion equations. These computations reveal that the threading topology induces an exotic motion in which the thring swims in the plane of the ring.

Scaling down transparent electrodes to the length scale of a single neuron is challenging since conventional transparent conductors are limited by their capacitive electrode/electrolyte interface. In this study, we establish transparent microelectrode arrays with high performance, great biocompatibility, and comprehensive in vivo validations from a recently developed, bilayer-nanomesh material composite, where a metal layer and a low-impedance faradaic interfacial layer are stacked reliably together in a same transparent nanomesh pattern. Specifically, flexible arrays from 32 bilayer-nanomesh microelectrodes demonstrated near-unity yield with high uniformity, excellent biocompatibility, and great compatibility with state-of-the-art wireless recording and real-time artifact rejection system. The electrodes are highly scalable, with 130 kilohms at 1 kHz at 20 μm in diameter, comparable to the performance of microelectrodes in nontransparent Michigan arrays. The highly transparent, bilayer-nanomesh microelectrode arrays allowed in vivo two-photon imaging of single neurons in layer 2/3 of the visual cortex of awake mice, along with high-fidelity, simultaneous electrical recordings of visual-evoked activity, both in the multi-unit activity band and at lower frequencies by measuring the visual-evoked potential in the time domain. Together, these advances reveal the great potential of transparent arrays from bilayer-nanomesh microelectrodes for a broad range of utility in neuroscience and medical practices.","['1 Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', ""2 Center for Life Science, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA."", '3 Department of Bioengineering, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.', '4 School of Material Science and Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China.', '5 Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC 27695, USA.', '6 School of Optical and Electronic Information, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430074, China.', '7 Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.', '8 California NanoSystems Institute, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.', '9 Department of Bioengineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA 02120, USA.']","Yi Qiang, Pietro Artoni, Kyung Jin Seo, Stanislav Culaclii, Victoria Hogan, Xuanyi Zhao, Yiding Zhong, Xun Han, Po-Min Wang, Yi-Kai Lo, Yueming Li, Henil A Patel, Yifu Huang, Abhijeet Sambangi, Jung Soo V Chu, Wentai Liu, Michela Fagiolini, Hui Fang, ",Science advances,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30191176

Although a few systematic studies have been conducted, the true extent of protein-small molecule interactions in biological systems remains unknown. PROtein-metabolite interactions using size separation (PROMIS) is a method for studying protein-small molecule interactions in a non-targeted, proteome- and metabolome-wide manner. This approach uses size-exclusion chromatography followed by proteomics and metabolomics liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the collected fractions. Assuming that small molecules bound to proteins would co-fractionate together, we found numerous small molecules co-eluting with proteins, strongly suggesting the formation of stable complexes. Using PROMIS, we identified known small molecule-protein complexes, such as between enzymes and cofactors, and also found novel interactions. © 2019 The Authors.

1922,Development of postural control during single-leg standing in children aged 3-10 years,"Background:
      
    

    
      The ability to control the center of mass (COM) during single-leg standing (SLS) is imperative for individuals to walk independently. However, detailed biomechanical features of postural control during SLS performed by children remain to be comprehensively investigated. Research question:
      
    

    
      We aimed to investigate the development of postural control during SLS in children aged 3-10 years. Methods:
      
    

    
      Forty-eight healthy children (26 boys and 22 girls) aged 3-10 years and 11 young adults participated in this experiment. The child population was divided into four groups by age: 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, and 9-10 years. The SLS task included standing on a single leg as long and as steady as possible for up to 30 s. A three-dimensional motion capture system and two force plates were used for calculating the COM and center of pressure (COP). The task was divided into three phases (accelerated, decelerated, and steady) on the basis of the relationship between COM and COP. Results:
      
    

    
      COP-COM distances in the 5-6 years' and 7-8 years' groups were significantly increased during the acceleration phase when compared with those in the adult group. Furthermore, COP-COM distances during the decelerated phase were significantly higher in all children's groups compared with those in the adult group. Lastly, COP-COM distance during the steady phase was significantly higher in the 3-4 year age group than in the 9-10 year age and adults groups. Significance:
      
    

    
      These results suggest that postural control during the acceleration and steady phases mature by 9 years. Conversely, children ∼10 years did not attain adult-like levels of postural control during the decelerated phase. The developmental process for postural control at each phase possibly plays a significant role in the basic biomechanics of movement and does not display a monotonic pattern.","['1 Department of Rehabilitation Science, Faculty of Health Sciences, Hokkaido University.

1929,Using expert data to inform the use of research methods and representations to enhance biochemistry instruction and textbook design,"Biochemistry textbooks often provide a disconnected, highly mathematical, and decontextualized treatment of thermodynamic and kinetic principles, which renders topics like protein folding difficult to teach. This is concerning given that graduates entering careers, like the pharmaceutical industry, must be able to apply such knowledge and related research methods to solve biochemistry research problems. Thus, it is essential that instructors have strategies to incorporate research methods and representations to help students understand the source of such scientific knowledge. Therefore, the goal of our work is to examine expert practice and use the findings to identify instructional strategies to incorporate more cutting-edge research and authentic ways of knowing into science classrooms and textbooks. Toward this goal, we examined how four scientists explain protein folding and dynamics research, focusing on the interaction of spoken language and representations, including gesture. Our analysis indicates that experts employ multiple representations and research methods to communicate how evidence can be used to understand phenomena. In contrast, textbooks explain what is known but seldom use representations to explain how it is known. Based on our findings, we suggest implications for instruction, including the design of textbooks, as well as potential instructional strategies to incorporate discussion of experimental methods and interpretation of representations during classroom activities. © 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 47(5):513-531, 2019.","['1 Department of Chemistry, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana.', '2 Department of Biological Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana.']","Kathleen A Jeffery, Nancy J Pelaez, Trevor R Anderson, ",Biochemistry and molecular biology education : a bimonthly publication of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,2019 Sep,Protein folding; biochemistry; experimental methods; gesture; instructional strategies; representations.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31120599
1930,The Mechanisms of Action of Cationic Antimicrobial Peptides Refined by Novel Concepts from Biophysical Investigations,"Even 30 years after the discovery of magainins, biophysical and structural investigations on how these peptides interact with membranes can still bear surprises and add new interesting detail to how these peptides exert their antimicrobial action. Early on, using oriented solid-state NMR spectroscopy, it was found that the amphipathic helices formed by magainins are active when being oriented parallel to the membrane surface. More recent investigations indicate that this in-planar alignment is also found when PGLa and magainin in combination exert synergistic pore-forming activities, where studies on the mechanism of synergistic interaction are ongoing. In a related manner, the investigation of dimeric antimicrobial peptide sequences has become an interesting topic of research which bears promise to refine our views how antimicrobial action occurs. The molecular shape concept has been introduced to explain the effects of lipids and peptides on membrane morphology, locally and globally, and in particular of cationic amphipathic helices that partition into the membrane interface. This concept has been extended in this review to include more recent ideas on soft membranes that can adapt to external stimuli including membrane-disruptive molecules. In this manner, the lipids can change their shape in the presence of low peptide concentrations, thereby maintaining the bilayer properties. At higher peptide concentrations, phase transitions occur which lead to the formation of pores and membrane lytic processes. In the context of the molecular shape concept, the properties of lipopeptides, including surfactins, are shortly presented, and comparisons with the hydrophobic alamethicin sequence are made.","['1 Université de Strasbourg/CNRS, UMR7177, Institut de Chimie, Strasbourg, France.', '2 Université de Strasbourg/CNRS, UMR7177, Institut de Chimie, Strasbourg, France. bechinge@unistra.fr.', '3 Faculté de chimie, Institut le Bel, Strasbourg, France. bechinge@unistra.fr.']","Christopher Aisenbrey, Arnaud Marquette, Burkhard Bechinger, ",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,2019,Alamethicin; Carpet model; Cecropin; LL37; Magainin; Membrane macroscopic phase; Membrane pore; Membrane topology; Molecular shape concept; PGLa; Peptide-lipid interactions; SMART model; Surfactin; Toroidal pore model.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30980352

1934,Electromechanical Assessment of Optogenetically Modulated Cardiomyocyte Activity,"Over the past two decades, optogenetic tools have been established as potent means to modulate cell-type specific activity in excitable tissues, including the heart. While Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) is a common tool to depolarize the membrane potential in cardiomyocytes (CM), potentially eliciting action potentials (AP), an effective tool for reliable silencing of CM activity has been missing. It has been suggested to use anion channelrhodopsins (ACR) for optogenetic inhibition. Here, we describe a protocol to assess the effects of activating the natural ACR GtACR1 from Guillardia theta in cultured rabbit CM. Primary readouts are electrophysiological patch-clamp recordings and optical tracking of CM contractions, both performed while applying different patterns of light stimulation. The protocol includes CM isolation from rabbit heart, seeding and culturing of the cells for up to 4 days, transduction via adenovirus coding for the light-gated chloride channel, preparation of patch-clamp and carbon fiber setups, data collection and analysis. Using the patch-clamp technique in whole-cell configuration allows one to record light-activated currents (in voltage-clamp mode, V-clamp) and AP (current-clamp mode, I-clamp) in real time. In addition to patch-clamp experiments, we conduct contractility measurements for functional assessment of CM activity without disturbing the intracellular milieu. To do so, cells are mechanically preloaded using carbon fibers and contractions are recorded by tracking changes in sarcomere length and carbon fiber distance. Data analysis includes assessment of AP duration from I-clamp recordings, peak currents from V-clamp recordings and force calculation from carbon fiber measurements. The described protocol can be applied to the testing of biophysical effects of different optogenetic actuators on CM activity, a prerequisite for the development of a mechanistic understanding of optogenetic experiments in cardiac tissue and whole hearts.","['1 Institute for Experimental Cardiovascular Medicine, University Heart Center Freiburg-Bad Krozingen, Medical Center-University of Freiburg; Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg; Faculty of Biology, University of Freiburg; ramona.kopton@universitaets-herzzentrum.de.', '2 Institute for Experimental Cardiovascular Medicine, University Heart Center Freiburg-Bad Krozingen, Medical Center-University of Freiburg; Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg.']","Ramona A Kopton, Cinthia Buchmann, Robin Moss, Peter Kohl, Rémi Peyronnet, Franziska Schneider-Warme, ",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32202521

The goal of the first study was to confirm whether ACC could be evoked with TEN stimuli and to also optimize the test conditions. The goal of the second study was to determine whether the TEN-ACC test is capable of detecting CDR(s). The ACC responses were successfully recorded from all study participants. Both behaviorally and electrophysiologically obtained masked thresholds (TEN threshold and TEN-ACC threshold) were similar and below 10 and 12 dB SNR in NH listeners, respectively. HI listeners were divided into HI (non-CDR) and CDR groups based on the behavioral TEN test. For the non-CDR group, TEN-ACC thresholds were below 12 dB which were similar to NH listeners. However, for the CDR group, TEN-ACC thresholds were significantly higher (≥12 dB SNR) than those in the NH and HI groups, indicating that CDR(s) can be objectively detected using the ACC. Results of this study demonstrate that it is possible to detect the presence of CDR using an electrophysiologic method.","['1 Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', '2 School of Electrical Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, University of Ulsan, Ulsan, Korea.', '3 Departments of Speech Pathology and Audiology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, USA.', '4 Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Samsung Changwon Hospital, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Changwon, Korea. hongsh@skku.edu.', '5 Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea. moonij@skku.edu.']","Soojin Kang, Jihwan Woo, Heesung Park, Carolyn J Brown, Sung Hwa Hong, Il Joon Moon, ",Scientific reports,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29483598

By using differential equations and the law of mass action, many researchers have discovered information about the mechanisms of enzyme workings in the more than 100 years since Leonor Michaelis and Maud Menten published their classic paper in 1913. This work uses he laws obeyed by molecules during a reaction, translates them into mathematical equations, and then compares the results predicted by the equations to data obtained in laboratory conditions. This can inform whether the mechanism used to create the mathematical model is consistent with experimental results. Philip K. Maini has contributed to several significant results in the field of mathematical modelling in enzyme kinetics. Along with his collaborators, he has published results analyzing and extending the Quasi-Steady State Assumption, applying it to special enzyme reactions, and considering special conditions. This review paper will provide an overview of the contributions made by PK Maini to the field of modelling enzyme kinetics, summarize the main results and discuss their significance.","['1 Department of Mathematics, Kennesaw State University, 370 Paulding Ave. NW Kennesaw.

1942,Evaluating the appropriateness of AccessMedicine in integrated biochemistry learning for chinese medical students,"Recently, Chinese medical education has exhibited a shifting trend from teacher-centered instruction to student-centered learning, which usually includes a self-directed learning process. Providing students with high-quality and appropriate supplemental resources is necessary for their self-directed learning. This study aimed to investigate the appropriateness of AccessMedicine, an online medical resource, for first-year medical students at Tongji University in China. In the randomized controlled trial, 42 students were stratified by gender and grade point average (GPA) and randomly assigned to either the control group or AccessMedicine group. The students' learning outcomes were assessed with quizzes, including tests before and after learning and a final examination. Paired t-tests and two-way analysis of variance were performed for statistical analysis. We found that AccessMedicine-assisted learning improved student performance on tests and decreased the overall failure rate in the final examination. Further analysis showed that the final examination score of the subgroup with high GPAs in the AccessMedicine group significantly increased, but not that of the subgroup with low GPAs, indicating that AccessMedicine-assisted learning was more beneficial for good students than for poor students. A survey showed that professional vocabularies were the greatest obstacles to learning with AccessMedicine. Moreover, English language skills greatly affected the students' learning outcomes for the English resource but not those for the Chinese resource. Taken together, our results demonstrated that AccessMedicine was appropriate for Chinese medical education and improved the learning outcomes of students, especially students with high GPAs and a good command over the English language. © 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 47(3):272-278, 2019.","['1 Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Department of Regenerative Medicine, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200092, China.']","Furong Gao, Jiao Li, Jie Xu, Song Jia, Lei Xu, Siguang Li, Guo-Tong Xu, Lixia Lu, ",Biochemistry and molecular biology education : a bimonthly publication of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,2019 May,AccessMedicine; Chinese medical education; Electronic resources; learning outcomes.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30725505
1943,Metabolic interaction between urea cycle and citric acid cycle shunt: A guided approach,"This article is a guided pedagogical approach, devoted to postgraduate students specializing in biochemistry, aimed at presenting all single reactions and overall equations leading to the metabolic interaction between ureagenesis and citric acid cycle to be incorporated into a two-three lecture series about the interaction of urea cycle with other metabolic pathways. We emphasize that citrate synthetase, aconitase, and isocitrate dehydrogenase, three enzymes of the citric acid cycle are not involved, thus creating a shunt in citric acid cycle. In contrast, the glutamic-oxaloacetate transaminase, which does not belong to citric acid cycle, has a paramount importance in the metabolic interaction of the two cycles, because it generates aspartate, one of the two fuel molecules of urea cycle, and a-ketoglutarate, an intermediate of the citric acid cycle. Finally, students should appreciate that balancing equations for all atoms and charges is not only a stoichiometric task, but strongly facilitates the discussion of the physiological roles of metabolic pathways.

1944,Bionic reconstruction : Restoration of extremity function with osseointegrated and mind-controlled prostheses,"Background:
      
    

    
      Loss of an extremity at any level has a major impact on a patient's life. Using bionic reconstruction, extremity function can be restored and the patient reintegrated into daily life. Surgical procedures including selective nerve transfer and anchoring of prostheses into bone are combined with structured rehabilitation and modern prosthetic fitting. The patient is thereby able to use the prostheses intuitively and with multiple degrees of freedom. Methods:
      
    

    
      This article presents the concept and approach for modern bionic reconstruction in detail and the relevant literature. The nerve transfer matrices for targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR) and the concept of osseointegration to optimally fit a patient with a modern prosthesis are described in detail. As a clinical example, the case of a patient who suffered from traumatic amputation and subsequently received TMR in combination with an osseointegrated implant and structured rehabilitation is presented. Results:
      
    

    
      Using bionic reconstruction, basic hand functions can be restored and bimanual dexterity can expand the range of daily activities. Besides this approach to bionic reconstruction, its advantages and disadvantages are compared to hand transplantation. The limitations and perspectives of modern bionic reconstruction are also discussed. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Bionic reconstruction is a sophisticated method for restoring extremity function and nowadays can be considered a standard of care for all levels of upper extremity amputations. An interdisciplinary approach and structured rehabilitation are necessary to master prosthetic function to ultimately reintegrate patients into daily life.","['1 CD Laboratory for the Restoration of Extremity Function, Department of Surgery, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', '2 Division of Biomedical Research, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', '3 Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', '4 CD Laboratory for the Restoration of Extremity Function, Department of Surgery, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria. oskar.aszmann@meduniwien.ac.at.', '5 Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria. oskar.aszmann@meduniwien.ac.at.', '6 Christian Doppler Laboratory for Restoration of Extremity Function, Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Department of Surgery, Medical University of Vienna, Spitalgasse\xa023, 1090, Vienna, Austria. oskar.aszmann@meduniwien.ac.at.']","Martin Aman, Christopher Festin, Matthias E Sporer, Clemens Gstoettner, Cosima Prahm, Konstantin D Bergmeister, Oskar C Aszmann, ",Wiener klinische Wochenschrift,2019 Dec,Bionic reconstruction; Interface; Osseointegration; Prostheses; Rehabilitation.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31201567

1946,Highly effective active learning in a one-year biochemistry series with limited resources,"We investigate the effectiveness of an active learning curriculum designed for an upper division Biochemistry series at a large, public research university. The goal was to determine how effective this format was when compared to a parallel conventional course, and to see if the active learning series can be run with limited resources (one instructor, one teaching assistant). The study involved 160 students in the first quarter and 92 students in the second quarter. The active learning curriculum consists of learning goals for each chapter, online quizzes, in-class questions targeting the problematic areas, small group (3-4 students) discussions during class in which students presented their assumptions and arguments in support of their responses to online and in-class questions, and two-stage exams involving the ability to ""re-answer"" as a group following a discussion). The in-class questions involved the use of a student response system (i > clicker) (multiple choice) and short answer formats. Students in the active learning course and a control, conventional lecture course, took identical midterms and finals for the first, and second quarters. We found that students enrolled in the active learning curriculum had consistently better performance, with statistically significant higher scores on all tests for both quarters. The effect sizes of the improvements are medium to large and are independent of prior GPA and grades in prerequisites. This model curriculum redesign offers promise for improved student learning with less monetary investment than a flipped course model relying on, for example, an extensive collection of instructor-produced videos. © 2018 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 47(1):7-15, 2018.","['1 Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California, Santa Barbara, California, 93106.', '2 Department of Statistics and Applied Probability, University of California, Santa Barbara, California, 93106.']","Norbert Reich, Yuedong Wang, ",Biochemistry and molecular biology education : a bimonthly publication of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,2019 Jan,Active learning; assessment development; curriculum development.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30548908
1947,Analysis of correlation-based biomolecular networks from different omics data by fitting stochastic block models,"Background: Biological entities such as genes, promoters, mRNA, metabolites or proteins do not act alone, but in concert in their network context. Modules, i.e., groups of nodes with similar topological properties in these networks characterize important biological functions of the underlying biomolecular system. Edges in such molecular networks represent regulatory and physical interactions, and comparing them between conditions provides valuable information on differential molecular mechanisms. However, biological data is inherently noisy and network reduction techniques can propagate errors particularly to the level of edges. We aim to improve the analysis of networks of biological molecules by deriving modules together with edge relevance estimations that are based on global network characteristics. Methods: The key challenge we address here is investigating the capability of stochastic block models (SBMs) for representing and analyzing different types of biomolecular networks. Fitting them to SBMs both delivers modules of the networks and enables the derivation of edge confidence scores, and it has not yet been investigated for analyzing biomolecular networks. We apply SBM-based analysis independently to three correlation-based networks of breast cancer data originating from high-throughput measurements of different molecular layers: either transcriptomics, proteomics, or metabolomics. The networks were reduced by thresholding for correlation significance or by requirements on scale-freeness. Results and discussion: We find that the networks are best represented by the hierarchical version of the SBM, and many of the predicted blocks have a biologically and phenotypically relevant functional annotation. The edge confidence scores are overall in concordance with the biological evidence given by the measurements. We conclude that biomolecular networks can be appropriately represented and analyzed by fitting SBMs. As the SBM-derived edge confidence scores are based on global network connectivity characteristics and potential hierarchies within the biomolecular networks are considered, they could be used as additional, integrated features in network-based data comparisons.","['1 Bioinformatics and Modelling, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Strassen, Luxembourg.', '2 Mathematical Modelling of Cellular Processes, Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association, Berlin, Germany.', '3 School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore.']","Katharina Baum, Jagath C Rajapakse, Francisco Azuaje, ",F1000Research,2019,biomolecular networks; co-expression networks; edge relevance; hierarchical stochastic block model; missing and spurious edges; module detection; network-based omics analysis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31559017

Although all students completed the same questions, they were assessed on an individual protein they had worked on during the semester in the situated learning of the classroom as they completed computer-based tutorials and exercises using internet sources. The students' difficulties with the external representation of their protein were: not following directions, not understanding how to use the computational software, or a lack of knowledge about their protein. The students also were required to answer questions that required biochemical knowledge. The difficulties they experienced during the assessment can be attributed to factors, such as, their reasoning ability, understanding of the concepts, and the external representations of their protein. © 2018 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 46(6):634-643, 2018.","['1 Chemistry Department, Penn State Lehigh Valley, Center Valley, Pennsylvania.']","Julie B Ealy, ",Biochemistry and molecular biology education : a bimonthly publication of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,2018 Nov,Active learning; assessment; computational biology; contributions from cognitive science to student learning; molecular visualization; protein structure and function; visual literacy.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30462371
1950,Mammalian TRP ion channels are insensitive to membrane stretch,"TRP channels of the transient receptor potential ion channel superfamily are involved in a wide variety of mechanosensory processes, including touch sensation, pain, blood pressure regulation, bone loading and detection of cerebrospinal fluid flow. However, in many instances it is unclear whether TRP channels are the primary transducers of mechanical force in these processes. In this study, we tested stretch activation of eleven TRP channels from six mammalian subfamilies. We found that these TRP channels were insensitive to short membrane stretches in cellular systems. Furthermore, we purified TRPC6 and demonstrated its insensitivity to stretch in liposomes, an artificial bilayer system free from cellular components. Additionally, we demonstrated that, when expressed in C. elegans neurons, mouse TRPC6 restores the mechanoresponse of a touch insensitive mutant but requires diacylglycerol for activation. These results strongly suggest that the mammalian members of the TRP ion channel family are insensitive to tension induced by cell membrane stretching and, thus, are more likely to be activated by cytoplasmic tethers or downstream components and to act as amplifiers of cellular mechanosensory signaling cascades.","['1 Molecular Cardiology and Biophysics Division, Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute, Sydney 2010, Australia.', '2 Human Physiology, School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, University of Newcastle, Newcastle 2308, Australia.', '3 Department of Physiology, College of Medicine, The University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis 38163, USA.', '4 Human Physiology, School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, University of Newcastle, Newcastle 2308, Australia b.martinac@victorchang.edu.au derek.laver@newcastle.edu.au.', '5 Molecular Cardiology and Biophysics Division, Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute, Sydney 2010, Australia b.martinac@victorchang.edu.au derek.laver@newcastle.edu.au.', ""6 St. Vincent's Clinical School, Faculty of Medicine, University of New South Wales, Sydney 2052, Australia.""]","Yury A Nikolaev, Charles D Cox, Pietro Ridone, Paul R Rohde, Julio F Cordero-Morales, Valeria Vásquez, Derek R Laver, Boris Martinac, ",Journal of cell science,2019,Ion channel reconstitution; Mechanosensitive channels; Mechanotransduction; TRP ion channels; TRPC6.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31722978
1951,Making glue from seeds and gums: Working with plant-based polymers to introduce students to plant biochemistry,"Plants and plant products are key to the survival of life on earth. Despite this fact, the significance of plant biochemistry is often underrepresented in science curricula. We designed an innovative laboratory activity to engage students in learning about the biochemical properties of natural polymers produced by plants. The focus of the hands-on activity is on mucilages and gums, which contain complex polysaccharides that have applications in industry. The 1.5-h activity is organized into three laboratory exercises. It begins with a demonstration of the water absorption property of seed coat mucilage upon hydration of seeds from psyllium, a plant that is grown commercially for mucilage production. The second exercise involves microscopy of a variety of plant seeds stained with ruthenium red dye to visualize pectin polysaccharides of the seed mucilage. Students learn about phenotypic variation among plant species and how the seed coat mucilage is beneficial to keep seeds hydrated during germination. The third exercise highlights an industrial application of plant gums as adhesives. The students prepare edible glue made with gum arabic, a type of plant polymer from the dried exudate of the Acacia plant. This three-part activity has been implemented in conjunction with a Girls Researching Our World (GROW) summer workshop for sixth to eighth graders over a 4-year period.

The simulation and experimental results show a good consistency on the suppressed depolarization and scatterering induced retardance, and the enhanced diattenuation caused by the absorption, and also indicate the birefringence induced retardance insensitive to the absorption.

1957,PepsNMR for 1 H NMR metabolomic data pre-processing,"In the analysis of biological samples, control over experimental design and data acquisition procedures alone cannot ensure well-conditioned 1H NMR spectra with maximal information recovery for data analysis. A third major element affects the accuracy and robustness of results: the data pre-processing/pre-treatment for which not enough attention is usually devoted, in particular in metabolomic studies. The usual approach is to use proprietary software provided by the analytical instruments' manufacturers to conduct the entire pre-processing strategy. This widespread practice has a number of advantages such as a user-friendly interface with graphical facilities, but it involves non-negligible drawbacks: a lack of methodological information and automation, a dependency of subjective human choices, only standard processing possibilities and an absence of objective quality criteria to evaluate pre-processing quality. This paper introduces PepsNMR to meet these needs, an R package dedicated to the whole processing chain prior to multivariate data analysis, including, among other tools, solvent signal suppression, internal calibration, phase, baseline and misalignment corrections, bucketing and normalisation. Methodological aspects are discussed and the package is compared to the gold standard procedure with two metabolomic case studies. The use of PepsNMR on these data shows better information recovery and predictive power based on objective and quantitative quality criteria. Other key assets of the package are workflow processing speed, reproducibility, reporting and flexibility, graphical outputs and documented routines.","['1 Institute of Statistics, Biostatistics and Actuarial Sciences (ISBA/IMMAQ), Université catholique de Louvain (UCL), Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium.

This study examines the implementation of the multilevel inquiry approach in order to achieve meaningful biochemistry learning. Such as approach begins with a structured inquiry, leading to a guided inquiry, and ending with an open inquiry on topics that are connected to each other. A posttest-only control group design was employed, with a total sample of 87 students taking biochemistry courses. The control class consisted of 43 students, with 44 students in the experimental class. The variables tested were learning outcomes, practical skills, and attitudes toward biochemistry, while the effect of the implementation of multilevel inquiry on these three variables was analyzed using multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). The results show that the class that applied the multilevel inquiry approach achieved higher scores in all three variables than the control class. The MANOVA test shows that the implementation of this approach has a positive effect on the three variables, which represent the cognitive, psychomotor, and affective domains, and that multilevel inquiry was able to foster meaningful learning in biochemistry courses. © 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 48(1):28-37, 2020.","['1 Study Program of Chemistry Education, Faculty of Teacher Training and Education, Universitas Mataram, Mataram, Indonesia.']","Yunita Arian Sani Anwar, ",Biochemistry and molecular biology education : a bimonthly publication of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,2020 Jan,Attitudes toward biochemistry; biochemistry learning; inquiry; meaningful learning; practical skills.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31566858

This strategy may be used to achieve better affinity and efficacy or improved properties compared with the parent molecules, to interact with two or multiple targets, to reduce undesirable side effects, to decrease drug-drug interactions, or to reduce the emergence of drug resistance. The approach offers the prospect of better drugs for the treatment of many human diseases. Research activity in this area is increasing and has attracted many practitioners worldwide. To accelerate the design and discovery of new hybrid-molecule-based drugs, it is essential to properly collect and annotate experimental data obtained from known hybrid molecules.

It contains structures, manually annotated design protocols, pharmacological data, some physicochemical properties, ligand efficiency, drug-likeness, and ADMET characteristics, and the biological targets of known hybrid molecules. HybridMolDB supports a range of query types, including searches by text, protein sequence, chemical structure similarity, and property ranges.

1962,Modulation of the frontal-parietal network by low intensity anti-phase 20 Hz transcranial electrical stimulation boosts performance in the attentional blink task,"Performance in the attentional blink task has been demonstrated to be directly influenced by alpha and beta neural oscillatory activity. In two experiments we stimulated the right parietal cortex and left frontal cortex with transcranial alternating current stimulation. For the first experiment we targeted only the right parietal cortex and found a non-significant increase in performance from 20 Hz stimulation. In the second experiment we applied two stimulators to the right parietal and left frontal cortex and found a significant increase in performance from 20 Hz tACS with a phase difference of 180°. Since low intensity stimulation has been shown to inhibit cortical excitability, and anti-phasic stimulation has been hypothesized to decrease presynaptic activation in one region and drive postsynaptic spikes in the other, we suggest that low intensity anti-phasic 20 Hz stimulation inhibited the parietal cortex, thereby disinhibiting the frontal cortex. This visual attention mechanism supposedly reduces processing of distractor stimuli and enhances processing of target stimuli.

1963,Using Drosophila to Understand General Anesthesia: From Synapses to Behavior,"Investigating mechanisms of general anesthesia requires access to multiple levels of neuronal function, from effects at individual synapses to responses in behaving animals. Drosophila melanogaster provides an excellent model to test different theories for general anesthesia because it offers robust methods for testing local as well as global target processes, in an animal that is similarly impacted by these diverse drugs as humans. Here, we outline methods to quantify two such endpoints, neurotransmission and behavioral responsiveness, focusing on the intravenous drug propofol.","['1 Queensland Brain Institute, The University of Queensland, St Lucia, QLD, Australia; School of Medical Science and Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University Gold Coast Campus, Gold Coast, QLD, Australia.', '2 Queensland Brain Institute, The University of Queensland, St Lucia, QLD, Australia.', '3 Queensland Brain Institute, The University of Queensland, St Lucia, QLD, Australia.

1964,Electrohysterography in the diagnosis of preterm birth: a review,"Preterm birth (PTB) is one of the most common and serious complications in pregnancy. About 15 million preterm neonates are born every year, with ratios of 10-15% of total births. In industrialized countries, preterm delivery is responsible for 70% of mortality and 75% of morbidity in the neonatal period. Diagnostic means for its timely risk assessment are lacking and the underlying physiological mechanisms are unclear. Surface recording of the uterine myoelectrical activity (electrohysterogram, EHG) has emerged as a better uterine dynamics monitoring technique than traditional surface pressure recordings and provides information on the condition of uterine muscle in different obstetrical scenarios with emphasis on predicting preterm deliveries. Objective:
      
    

    
      A comprehensive review of the literature was performed on studies related to the use of the electrohysterogram in the PTB context. Approach:
      
    

    
      This review presents and discusses the results according to the different types of parameter (temporal and spectral, non-linear and bivariate) used for EHG characterization. Main results:
      
    

    
      Electrohysterogram analysis reveals that the uterine electrophysiological changes that precede spontaneous preterm labor are associated with contractions of more intensity, higher frequency content, faster and more organized propagated activity and stronger coupling of different uterine areas. Temporal, spectral, non-linear and bivariate EHG analyses therefore provide useful and complementary information. Classificatory techniques of different types and varying complexity have been developed to diagnose PTB. The information derived from these different types of EHG parameters, either individually or in combination, is able to provide more accurate predictions of PTB than current clinical methods. However, in order to extend EHG to clinical applications, the recording set-up should be simplified, be less intrusive and more robust-and signal analysis should be automated without requiring much supervision and yield physiologically interpretable results. Significance:
      
    

    
      This review provides a general background to PTB and describes how EHG can be used to better understand its underlying physiological mechanisms and improve its prediction. The findings will help future research workers to decide the most appropriate EHG features to be used in their analyses and facilitate future clinical EHG applications in order to improve PTB prediction.","['1 Centro de Investigación e Innovación en Bioingeniería (CI2B), Universitat Politècnica de València (UPV), Camino de Vera SN, 46022, Valencia, Spain.']","J Garcia-Casado, Y Ye-Lin, G Prats-Boluda, J Mas-Cabo, J Alberola-Rubio, A Perales, ",Physiological measurement,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29406317

1966,A Novel Grading Strategy for Team-Based Learning Exercises in a Hands-on Course in Molecular Biology for Senior Undergraduate Underrepresented Students in Medicine Resulted in Stronger Student Performance,"We developed a hands-on course in molecular biology for undergraduate underrepresented in medicine (URM) students. To incentivize student preparation for team-based learning (TBL) activities, we implemented a novel grading schema that requires a minimum individual readiness assurance test (iRAT) score to share the team group readiness assurance test (gRAT) score. Fifty-one students participated in this 2-year study and were divided in teams of five or six students that worked throughout the course on a unique, hands-on project and also participated in TBL exercises. In the laboratory sessions, students isolated RNA from cultured neuronal cells, synthesized complementary DNA (cDNA), and used gene sequencing to identify a gene relevant in human health and disease. Student participation in TBL was quantified and correlated with performance on individual iRATs and the course final examination. We found that implementation of the novel incentive structure lowered the variance of TBL scores (iRAT and gRAT) and strengthened the correlation between final examination scores and either iRAT scores or percentage participation in TBL. Subgroup analysis showed that with the new grading schema, stronger students benefited more from the gRAT exercises, while more poorly performing students were better helped by individual preparation prior to the iRAT exercise. A combination of two active learning strategies, TBL and hands-on sessions, may strengthen student acquisition of course content and promote teamwork skills. The new incentive structure seems to reduce the disparity in knowledge amongst our students as demonstrated by the reduced iRAT and gRAT score variances. © 2018 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 47(2): 115-123, 2019.","['1 From the Department of Biomedical Sciences, Cooper Medical School of Rowan University, Camden, New Jersey.', '2 Department of Medical Sciences, Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University, Nutley, New Jersey.']","Gonzalo A Carrasco, Kathryn C Behling, Osvaldo J Lopez, ",Biochemistry and molecular biology education : a bimonthly publication of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,2019 Mar,Active learning; integration of research into undergraduate teaching; molecular biology; new course development.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30589488
1967,Development and application of a comprehensive machine learning program for predicting molecular biochemical and pharmacological properties,"We establish a comprehensive quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model termed AlphaQ through the machine learning algorithm to associate the fully quantum mechanical molecular descriptors with various biochemical and pharmacological properties. Preliminarily, a novel method for molecular structural alignments was developed in such a way to maximize the quantum mechanical cross correlations among the molecules. Besides the improvement of structural alignments, three-dimensional (3D) distribution of the molecular electrostatic potential was introduced as the unique numerical descriptor for individual molecules. These dual modifications lead to a substantial accuracy enhancement in multifarious 3D-QSAR prediction models of AlphaQ. Most remarkably, AlphaQ has been proven to be applicable to structurally diverse molecules to the extent that it outperforms the conventional QSAR methods in estimating the inhibitory activity against thrombin, the water-cyclohexane distribution coefficient, the permeability across the membrane of the Caco-2 cell, and the metabolic stability in human liver microsomes. Due to the simplicity in model building and the high predictive capability for varying biochemical and pharmacological properties, AlphaQ is anticipated to serve as a valuable screening tool at both early and late stages of drug discovery.","['1 Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Sejong University, 209 Neungdong-ro, Kwangjin-gu, Seoul 05006, Korea. hspark@sejong.ac.kr.']","Hwanho Choi, Hongsuk Kang, Kee-Choo Chung, Hwangseo Park, ",Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30775759

Currently, the majority of glycans are analysed using mass spectrometry (MS)-based techniques, which can provide information on regioisomers but usually fail to differentiate stereoisomers. A promising approach to overcome this limitation is to implement ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) as an additional gas-phase separation dimension. This review highlights recent developments in which IM-MS was used as a tool for comprehensive glycan analysis or as rapid screening method for glycan feature analysis. Furthermore, we summarize a series of very recent investigations in which gas-phase spectroscopy is applied to study glycans and discuss the potential of the hyphenation between IM-MS and infrared (IR) spectroscopy as a future tool for glycomics and glycoproteomics.","['1 Institute of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Freie Universität Berlin, Takustr. 3, 14195 Berlin, Germany; Fritz Haber Institute of the Max Planck Society, Faradayweg 4-6, 14195 Berlin, Germany.', '2 Institute of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Freie Universität Berlin, Takustr. 3, 14195 Berlin, Germany; Fritz Haber Institute of the Max Planck Society, Faradayweg 4-6, 14195 Berlin, Germany.

      Radiation exposure in the catherization laboratory is associated with significant health risks. It is unclear whether a reduction of radiation exposure with the use of ""near-zero fluoroscopy"" protocols is possible when applied by less experienced operators. Methods:
      
    

    
      Consecutive ablation procedures with the use of a 3D mapping system were analyzed. Three time periods were analyzed. During the first period (standard), no specific radiation-reduction protocol was used. During the second period (initial phase of radiation reduction) a near ""near-zero fluoroscopy"" protocol was implemented; however, the majority of procedures were performed by an expert. During the third period (routine use of radiation reduction), less experienced operators (fellow and beginner) performed a growing number of procedures with the ""near-zero fluoroscopy"" protocol. Results:
      
    

    
      In all, 290 procedures were analyzed. After implementation of a radiation-reduced protocol, a significant reduction of radiation exposure was observed (standard 850 ± 831.7 vs. initial phase 197.2 ± 481.8 μGy/m2, p < 0.001, and vs. routine use 283 ± 493.8 μGy/m2, p < 0.001). No significant difference was observed between the initial phase and routine phase (p = 1). Over the three periods, the proportion of procedures performed by less experienced operators grew significantly for complex (fellow: 0% vs. 10% vs. 30%; p < 0.001) and noncomplex procedures (fellow: 30% vs. 39% vs. 49%; beginner: 15% vs. 38% vs. 34%; p = 0.002).

In addition, MPA Portable now supports state-of-the-art database search engines and a convenient command line interface for high-performance data processing tasks. While search engine results can easily be combined to increase the protein identification yield, an additional two-step workflow is implemented to provide sufficient analysis resolution for further postprocessing steps, such as protein grouping as well as taxonomic and functional annotation.

In extant metabolic enzymes, furthermore, such limits are seldom approached, suggesting that the degree of specificity of these enzymes, on average, is much lower than could be attained. During biological evolution, the activity of a single enzyme with available alternative substrates may be preserved to a significant or even substantial level for different reasons - for example when the alternative reaction contributes to fitness, or when its undesirable products are nevertheless dispatched by metabolite repair enzymes. In turn, the widespread occurrence of promiscuous reactions is a consistent source of metabolic 'messiness', from which both liabilities and opportunities ensue in the evolution of metabolic systems.","['1 Department of Chemistry, Life Sciences, and Environmental Sustainability, University of Parma, 43124 Parma, Italy.

1974,Persistent Sodium Current Mediates the Steep Voltage Dependence of Spatial Coding in Hippocampal Pyramidal Neurons,"The mammalian hippocampus forms a cognitive map using neurons that fire according to an animal's position (""place cells"") and many other behavioral and cognitive variables. The responses of these neurons are shaped by their presynaptic inputs and the nature of their postsynaptic integration. In CA1 pyramidal neurons, spatial responses in vivo exhibit a strikingly supralinear dependence on baseline membrane potential. The biophysical mechanisms underlying this nonlinear cellular computation are unknown. Here, through a combination of in vitro, in vivo, and in silico approaches, we show that persistent sodium current mediates the strong membrane potential dependence of place cell activity. This current operates at membrane potentials below the action potential threshold and over seconds-long timescales, mediating a powerful and rapidly reversible amplification of synaptic responses, which drives place cell firing. Thus, we identify a biophysical mechanism that shapes the coding properties of neurons composing the hippocampal cognitive map.","['1 Janelia Research Campus, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Ashburn, VA 20147, USA.', '2 Neurosurgery Department, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', '3 Janelia Research Campus, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Ashburn, VA 20147, USA.

1976,A biophysical model of dynamic balancing of excitation and inhibition in fast oscillatory large-scale networks,"Over long timescales, neuronal dynamics can be robust to quite large perturbations, such as changes in white matter connectivity and grey matter structure through processes including learning, aging, development and certain disease processes. One possible explanation is that robust dynamics are facilitated by homeostatic mechanisms that can dynamically rebalance brain networks. In this study, we simulate a cortical brain network using the Wilson-Cowan neural mass model with conduction delays and noise, and use inhibitory synaptic plasticity (ISP) to dynamically achieve a spatially local balance between excitation and inhibition. Using MEG data from 55 subjects we find that ISP enables us to simultaneously achieve high correlation with multiple measures of functional connectivity, including amplitude envelope correlation and phase locking. Further, we find that ISP successfully achieves local E/I balance, and can consistently predict the functional connectivity computed from real MEG data, for a much wider range of model parameters than is possible with a model without ISP.","['1 Oxford Centre for Human Brain Activity, Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging, Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, United Kingdom.', '2 Oxford Centre for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain, Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging, University of Oxford, United Kingdom.', '3 Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham, United Kingdom.', '4 National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Nottingham Biomedical Research Centre, Queens Medical Centre, Nottingham.', '5 Department of Diagnostic Imaging, Neurosciences & Mental Health, Research Institute, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']","Romesh G Abeysuriya, Jonathan Hadida, Stamatios N Sotiropoulos, Saad Jbabdi, Robert Becker, Benjamin A E Hunt, Matthew J Brookes, Mark W Woolrich, ",PLoS computational biology,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29474352

In this article, a biomimetic photonic approach inspired by the jamming avoidance response in a weakly electric fish genus, Eigenmannia, is naturally adopted to experimentally tackle signal jamming in wireless systems.

Such re-treatments may involve the further exposure of tissues such as the brain or spinal cord. A time-dependent model has been developed, which incorporates data from all published radiobiological experiments concerned with the in vivo re-irradiation of the spinal cord using photons. It allows an estimation of the increasing recovery in tissue tolerance with elapsed time after the initial treatment course. In accordance with the experimental evidence, the recovery rate depends on the biological effective dose (BED) of the initial treatment. Various degrees of conservatism have been introduced in the model to allow for potential changes in CNS tissue tolerance due to patient age, chemotherapy, surgery etc. An estimation of the re-treatment dose-fractionation schedule is made easier by the use of a downloadable Graphical User Interface (GUI). Worked examples of its use are given forconventional photon (X-ray) based treatments, and also for protons, where relative biological effectiveness (RBE) considerations must be respected within the BED estimates. The model provides boundary conditions for clinical practice. The responsible clinician can choose to usemore 'forgiving' BED values and from this to calculate the re-irradiation dose-fractionation schedule. For protons, greater care is required sincethe inter-relationship between linear energy transfer (LET) and RBE can lead to significant over-dosage relative to accepted CNS tolerance doses, especially with the use of scanned proton beams. LET and RBE factors are important in order to deliver safe and effective re-treatment doses.","['1 CRUK-MRC Oxford Centre, Gray Laboratory, Department of Oncology, University of Oxford, Old Road Research Campus Research Building, Roosevelt Drive, Oxford OX3 7DQ, United Kingdom; Green Templeton College, University of Oxford, 43 Woodstock Road, Oxford, OX2 6HG, United Kingdom.

1982,Electrophysiological Analysis of Voltage-Gated Ion Channel Modulation by General Anesthetics,"Voltage-gated ion channels (VGICs) of excitable tissues are emerging as targets likely involved in both the therapeutic and toxic effects of inhaled and intravenous general anesthetics. Whereas sevoflurane and propofol inhibit voltage-gated Na+ channels (Navs), sevoflurane potentiates certain voltage-gated K+ channels (Kvs). The combination of these effects would dampen neural excitability and, therefore, might contribute to the clinical endpoints of general anesthesia. As the body of work regarding the interaction of general anesthetics with VGICs continues to grow, a multidisciplinary approach involving functional, biochemical, structural, and computational techniques, many of which are detailed in other chapters, has increasingly become necessary to solve the molecular mechanism of general anesthetic action on VGICs.

We validate the computed depth-dependent probability distributions using SFD measurements in a layered phantom system with a highly scattering top layer of variable thickness supported by a highly absorbing base layer.

1984,Biochemical and Biophysical Assays of PAR-WWE Domain Interactions and Production of iso-ADPr for PAR-Binding Analysis,The poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family of proteins utilize NAD+ as the substrate to modify protein acceptors with either mono(ADP-ribose) (MAR) or poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR). MAR and PAR have been shown to regulate distinct cellular processes. Iso-ADP-ribose (iso-ADPr) is the smallest internal PAR structural unit containing the characteristic ribose-ribose glycosidic bond formed during poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. The WWE domain of RNF146 specifically recognizes the iso-ADPr moiety in PAR but does not interact with MAR. This provides a way to distinguish PAR from MAR modification and to isolate PARylated proteins. Iso-ADPr can be used to detect the PAR-specific binding properties of interested proteins. Here we describe the detailed method to generate and purify iso-ADPr and its use in PAR-binding analysis through isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) analysis.,"['1 Department of Biological Structure, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', '2 Department of Biological Structure, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA. wxu@u.washington.edu.']","Zhizhi Wang, Wenqing Xu, ","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2018,ADP-ribose; MAR; PAR; PARP; PARylation; WWE domain; iso-ADPr.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30097861

1987,"Updated Survey on Interventional Electrophysiology: 5-Year Follow-Up of Infrastructure, Procedures, and Training Positions in Germany","Objectives:
      
    

    
      This study provides an update and comparison to a 2010 nationwide survey on cardiac electrophysiology (EP), types and numbers of interventional electrophysiological procedures, and training opportunities in 2015. Background:
      
    

    
      In 2010, German cardiology centers performing interventional EP were identified and contacted to provide a survey on cardiac EP. Methods:
      
    

    
      German cardiology centers performing interventional EP in 2015 were identified from quality reports and contacted to repeat the 2010 questionnaire. Results:
      
    

    
      A majority of 131 centers (57%) responded. EP (ablation procedures and device therapy) was mainly part of a cardiology department (89%) and only independent (with its own budget) in 11%. The proportion of female physicians in EP training increased from 26% in 2010 to 38% in 2015. In total, 49,356 catheter ablations (i.e., 81% of reported ablations in 2015) were performed by the responding centers, resulting in a 44% increase compared with 2010 (the median number increased from 180 to 297 per center). Atrial fibrillation (AF) was the most common arrhythmia interventionally treated (47%). At 66% of the centers, (at least) 2 physicians were present during most catheter ablations. A minimum of 50 (75) AF ablations were performed at 80% (70%) of the centers. Pulmonary vein isolation with radiofrequency point-by-point ablation (62%) and cryoablation (33%) were the preferred ablation strategies. About one-third of centers reported surgical AF ablations, with 11 centers (8%) performing stand-alone surgical AF ablations. Only one-third of the responding 131 centers fulfilled all requirements for training center accreditation. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Comparing 2010 with 2015, an increasing number of EP centers and procedures in Germany are registered. In 2015, almost every second ablation was for therapy for AF. Thus, an increasing demand for catheter ablation is likely, but training opportunities are still limited, and most centers do not fulfil recommended requirements for ablation centers.","['1 Klinik für Kardiologie II - Rhythmologie, Department für Kardiologie und Angiologie, Universitätsklinikum Münster, Münster, Germany.

1988,A tool for functional brain imaging with lifespan compliance,"The human brain undergoes significant functional and structural changes in the first decades of life, as the foundations for human cognition are laid down. However, non-invasive imaging techniques to investigate brain function throughout neurodevelopment are limited due to growth in head-size with age and substantial head movement in young participants. Experimental designs to probe brain function are also limited by the unnatural environment typical brain imaging systems impose. However, developments in quantum technology allowed fabrication of a new generation of wearable magnetoencephalography (MEG) technology with the potential to revolutionise electrophysiological measures of brain activity. Here we demonstrate a lifespan-compliant MEG system, showing recordings of high fidelity data in toddlers, young children, teenagers and adults. We show how this system can support new types of experimental paradigm involving naturalistic learning. This work reveals a new approach to functional imaging, providing a robust platform for investigation of neurodevelopment in health and disease.","['1 Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham, University Park, Nottingham, NG7 2RD, United Kingdom.', '2 Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, OX3 9DU, United Kingdom.', '3 QuSpin Inc., 2011 Cherry Street, Unit 112, Louisville, CO, 80027, USA.', '4 Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London, 12 Queen Square, London, WC1N 3AR, United Kingdom.', '5 Oxford Centre for Human Brain Activity (OHBA), Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuro-Imaging, Department of psychiatry, University of Oxford, Warneford Hospital, Oxford, OX3 7JX, United Kingdom.', '6 Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham, University Park, Nottingham, NG7 2RD, United Kingdom. matthew.brookes@nottingham.ac.uk.']","Ryan M Hill, Elena Boto, Niall Holmes, Caroline Hartley, Zelekha A Seedat, James Leggett, Gillian Roberts, Vishal Shah, Tim M Tierney, Mark W Woolrich, Charlotte J Stagg, Gareth R Barnes, Richard Bowtell, Rebeccah Slater, Matthew J Brookes, ",Nature communications,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31690797

There has been a recent resurgence of interest in low-energy photon biology. This is due to concerns about health effects, increased use of biophoton imaging techniques, and the fact that biophotons can act as a bystander signal. This review discusses the history of light signaling in biology and potential mechanisms involved in the generation and transduction of signaling mechanisms.

1990,High-throughput and high-sensitivity phosphoproteomics with the EasyPhos platform,"Mass spectrometry has transformed the field of cell signaling by enabling global studies of dynamic protein phosphorylation ('phosphoproteomics'). Recent developments are enabling increasingly sophisticated phosphoproteomics studies, but practical challenges remain. The EasyPhos workflow addresses these and is sufficiently streamlined to enable the analysis of hundreds of phosphoproteomes at a depth of >10,000 quantified phosphorylation sites. Here we present a detailed and updated workflow that further ensures high performance in sample-limited conditions while also reducing sample preparation time. By eliminating protein precipitation steps and performing the entire protocol, including digestion, in a single 96-well plate, we now greatly minimize opportunities for sample loss and variability. This results in very high reproducibility and a small sample size requirement (≤200 μg of protein starting material). After cell culture or tissue collection, the protocol takes 1 d, whereas mass spectrometry measurements require ~1 h per sample. Applied to glioblastoma cells acutely treated with epidermal growth factor (EGF), EasyPhos quantified 20,132 distinct phosphopeptides from 200 μg of protein in less than 1 d of measurement time, revealing thousands of EGF-regulated phosphorylation events.","['1 School of Life and Environmental Sciences, The University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. sean.humphrey@sydney.edu.au.', '2 The Charles Perkins Centre, The University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. sean.humphrey@sydney.edu.au.', '3 Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany.', '4 School of Life and Environmental Sciences, The University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', '5 The Charles Perkins Centre, The University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', '6 Sydney Medical School, The University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', '7 Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany. mman@biochem.mpg.de.', '8 NNF Center for Protein Research, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark. mman@biochem.mpg.de.']","Sean J Humphrey, Ozge Karayel, David E James, Matthias Mann, ",Nature protocols,2018 Sep,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30190555
1991,"An electrodiffusive, ion conserving Pinsky-Rinzel model with homeostatic mechanisms","In most neuronal models, ion concentrations are assumed to be constant, and effects of concentration variations on ionic reversal potentials, or of ionic diffusion on electrical potentials are not accounted for. Here, we present the electrodiffusive Pinsky-Rinzel (edPR) model, which we believe is the first multicompartmental neuron model that accounts for electrodiffusive ion concentration dynamics in a way that ensures a biophysically consistent relationship between ion concentrations, electrical charge, and electrical potentials in both the intra- and extracellular space. The edPR model is an expanded version of the two-compartment Pinsky-Rinzel (PR) model of a hippocampal CA3 neuron. Unlike the PR model, the edPR model includes homeostatic mechanisms and ion-specific leakage currents, and keeps track of all ion concentrations (Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Cl-), electrical potentials, and electrical conductivities in the intra- and extracellular space. The edPR model reproduces the membrane potential dynamics of the PR model for moderate firing activity. For higher activity levels, or when homeostatic mechanisms are impaired, the homeostatic mechanisms fail in maintaining ion concentrations close to baseline, and the edPR model diverges from the PR model as it accounts for effects of concentration changes on neuronal firing. We envision that the edPR model will be useful for the field in three main ways. Firstly, as it relaxes commonly made modeling assumptions, the edPR model can be used to test the validity of these assumptions under various firing conditions, as we show here for a few selected cases. Secondly, the edPR model should supplement the PR model when simulating scenarios where ion concentrations are expected to vary over time. Thirdly, being applicable to conditions with failed homeostasis, the edPR model opens up for simulating a range of pathological conditions, such as spreading depression or epilepsy.","['1 Centre for Integrative Neuroplasticity, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', '2 Department of Physics, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', '3 Faculty of Science and Technolgy, Norwegian University of Life Sciences, Ås, Norway.']","Marte J Sætra, Gaute T Einevoll, Geir Halnes, ",PLoS computational biology,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32348299

1994,Coherent poly propagation materials with 3-dimensional photonic control over visible light,"The purpose of the present research was to identify and examine materials demonstrating a previously undiscovered property of coherent poly propagation (CPP). The materials were amorphous silicates as natural precious opals. CPP enabled three-dimensional photonic control over mono and polychromatic visible light wavelengths. CPP caused coherent diffraction of incident poly and monochromatic light. Apart from the iconic play-of-color of precious opal, CPP specimens demonstrated diffractive photonic demultiplexing and/or upconversion and/or downconversion of incident light with strong photonic coherence such that the shape of the incident light source was propagated over three dimensions over multiple visible frequencies. CPP events manifested as each specimen was rocked under the incident light. Additionally, the specimens demonstrated atypical control over internally reflected and transmitted light. The specimens applied axial rotational symmetry over the incident light. Amorphous materials would be expected to exert no symmetry control. CPP and rotational properties occurred in isolation from exogenous thermal, photonic and electrical influences. Furthermore, several non-destructive analytical instruments were employed, such as: spectrophotometer, polariscope and refractometer. The analytical methods revealed unusual behaviors of these specimens. The application of materials demonstrating three-dimensional photonic control will have far-reaching implications for many industries, including: photonic wavelength demultiplexing, fiber optics, imaging, microscopy, projections, security, cryptography, computers and communications.","['1 Department of Materials Research, Complete Consulting Services, LLC., Big Rapids, Michigan, United States of America.']","Michelle R Stem, ",PloS one,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31622371

1996,"Proximity effects in chromosome aberration induction: Dependence on radiation quality, cell type and dose","It is widely accepted that, in chromosome-aberration induction, the (mis-)rejoining probability of two chromosome fragments depends on their initial distance, r. However, several aspects of these ""proximity effects"" need to be clarified, also considering that they can vary with radiation quality, cell type and dose. A previous work performed by the BIANCA (BIophysical ANalysis of Cell death and chromosome Aberrations) biophysical model has suggested that, in human lymphocytes and fibroblasts exposed to low-LET radiation, an exponential function of the form exp(-r/r0), which is consistent with free-end (confined) diffusion, describes proximity effects better than a Gaussian function. Herein, the investigation was extended to intermediate- and high-LET. Since the r0 values (0.8 μm for lymphocytes and 0.7 μm for fibroblasts) were taken from the low-LET study, the results were obtained by adjusting only one model parameter, i.e. the yield of ""Cluster Lesions"" (CLs), where a CL was defined as a critical DNA damage producing two independent chromosome fragments. In lymphocytes, the exponential model allowed reproducing both dose-response curves for different aberrations (dicentrics, centric rings and excess acentrics), and values of F-ratio (dicentrics to centric rings) and G-ratio (interstitial deletions to centric rings). In fibroblasts, a good correspondence was found with the dose-response curves, whereas the G-ratio (and, to a lesser extent, the F-ratio) was underestimated. With increasing LET, F decreased and G increased in both cell types, supporting their role as ""fingerprints"" of high-LET exposure. A dose-dependence was also found at high LET, where F increased with dose and G decreased, possibly due to inter-track effects. We therefore conclude that, independent of radiation quality, in lymphocytes an exponential function can describe proximity effects at both inter- and intra-chromosomal level; on the contrary, in fibroblasts further studies (experimental and theoretical) are needed to explain the strong bias for intra-arm relative to inter-arm exchanges.","['1 University of Pavia, Physics Department, via Bassi 6, I-27100, Pavia, Italy; INFN (Italian Institute of Nuclear Physics)-Section of Pavia, via Bassi 6, I-27100, Pavia, Italy; Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Cidade Universitária Zeferino Vaz, Campinas, SP, Brazil.

1997,A Head-Mounted Camera System Integrates Detailed Behavioral Monitoring with Multichannel Electrophysiology in Freely Moving Mice,"Breakthroughs in understanding the neural basis of natural behavior require neural recording and intervention to be paired with high-fidelity multimodal behavioral monitoring. An extensive genetic toolkit for neural circuit dissection, and well-developed neural recording technology, make the mouse a powerful model organism for systems neuroscience. However, most methods for high-bandwidth acquisition of behavioral data in mice rely upon fixed-position cameras and other off-animal devices, complicating the monitoring of animals freely engaged in natural behaviors. Here, we report the development of a lightweight head-mounted camera system combined with head-movement sensors to simultaneously monitor eye position, pupil dilation, whisking, and pinna movements along with head motion in unrestrained, freely behaving mice. The power of the combined technology is demonstrated by observations linking eye position to head orientation; whisking to non-tactile stimulation; and, in electrophysiological experiments, visual cortical activity to volitional head movements.","['1 Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, University College London (UCL), London W1T 4JG, UK.

1998,Open-Source Tools for Processing and Analysis of In Vitro Extracellular Neuronal Signals,"The recent years have seen unprecedented growth in the manufacturing of neurotechnological tools. The latest technological advancements presented the neuroscientific community with neuronal probes containing thousands of recording sites. These next-generation probes are capable of simultaneously recording neuronal signals from a large number of channels. Numerically, a simple 128-channel neuronal data acquisition system equipped with a 16 bits A/D converter digitizing the acquired analog waveforms at a sampling frequency of 20 kHz will generate approximately 17 GB uncompressed data per hour. Today's biggest challenge is to mine this staggering amount of data and find useful information which can later be used in decoding brain functions, diagnosing diseases, and devising treatments. To this goal, many automated processing and analysis tools have been developed and reported in the literature. A good amount of them are also available as open source for others to adapt them to individual needs. Focusing on extracellularly recorded neuronal signals in vitro, this chapter provides an overview of the popular open-source tools applicable on these signals for spike trains and local field potentials analysis, and spike sorting. Towards the end, several future research directions have also been outlined.","['1 Computing and Technology, School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, UK. mufti.mahmud@ntu.ac.uk.', '2 NeuroChip Lab, Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.']","Mufti Mahmud, Stefano Vassanelli, ",Advances in neurobiology,2019,Local field potentials; Neuroengineering; Neuronal activity; Neuronal signal processing and analysis; Neuronal spikes.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31073939
1999,Database of free solution mobilities for 276 metabolites,"Although databases are available that provide mass spectra and chromatographic retention information for small-molecule metabolites, no publicly available database provides electrophoretic mobility for common metabolites. As a result, most compounds found in electrophoretic-based metabolic studies are unidentified and simply annotated as ""features"". To begin to address this issue, we analyzed 460 metabolites from a commercial library using capillary zone electrophoresis coupled with electrospray mass spectrometry. To speed analysis, a sequential injection method was used wherein six compounds were analyzed per run. An uncoated fused silica capillary was used for the analysis at 20 °C with a 0.5% (v/v) formic acid and 5% (v/v) methanol background electrolyte. A Prince autosampler was used for sample injection and the capillary was coupled to an ion trap mass spectrometer using an electrokinetically-pumped nanospray interface. We generated mobility values for 276 metabolites from the library (60% success rate) with an average standard deviation of 0.01 × 10-8 m2V-1s-1. As expected, cationic and anionic compounds were well resolved from neutral compounds. Neutral compounds co-migrated with electro-osmotic flow. Most of the compounds that were not detected were neutral and presumably suffered from adsorption to the capillary wall or poor ionization efficiency.","['1 Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, 46556-5670, USA.', '2 Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, 46556-5670, USA.

      The purpose of this study was to compare Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Esophagus (FACT-E) questionnaire changes during proton (PRT) or photon (XRT) chemoradiation therapy (CRT) for esophageal cancer (EC). Methods and materials:
      
    

    
      We reviewed patients enrolled in a prospective registry who received preoperative or definitive CRT for EC. Patients completed the FACT-E before CRT and during the last week of CRT. Analysis of variance testing was used to assess associations between patient and treatment characteristics and FACT-E score changes. Results:
      
    

    
      One hundred twenty-five patients completed a baseline and posttreatment FACT-E; 63 received XRT and 62 received PRT. The mean age was 65 years; the PRT group was older (68 vs 64 years, P = .0063). The following characteristics were similar between cohorts: 83% male, 78% adenocarcinoma, and 89% stage II-III. The radiation therapy prescription dose was higher in the PRT group (≥50 Gy in 94% vs 67%, P < .0001), whereas the median clinical target volume was smaller in the PRT group (553 vs 668 cm3, P = .013). Most (96%) received concurrent weekly carboplatin-paclitaxel. The mean FACT-E score was 136.3 (standard deviation [SD] 21.0) at baseline and 119.6 (SD 24.8) post-CRT, with mean change of -16.7 (SD 19.8). Baseline scores were comparable between XRT and PRT groups (135.9 vs 136.7, P = .82). On univariate and multivariate analyses, less mean decline in FACT-E score was observed for PRT versus XRT (-12.7 vs -20.6, P = .026) and for trimodality versus definitive therapy (-13.0 vs -22.5, P = .008).

2001,Adaptive optics imaging of the human retina,"Adaptive Optics (AO) retinal imaging has provided revolutionary tools to scientists and clinicians for studying retinal structure and function in the living eye. From animal models to clinical patients, AO imaging is changing the way scientists are approaching the study of the retina. By providing cellular and subcellular details without the need for histology, it is now possible to perform large scale studies as well as to understand how an individual retina changes over time. Because AO retinal imaging is non-invasive and when performed with near-IR wavelengths both safe and easily tolerated by patients, it holds promise for being incorporated into clinical trials providing cell specific approaches to monitoring diseases and therapeutic interventions. AO is being used to enhance the ability of OCT, fluorescence imaging, and reflectance imaging. By incorporating imaging that is sensitive to differences in the scattering properties of retinal tissue, it is especially sensitive to disease, which can drastically impact retinal tissue properties. This review examines human AO retinal imaging with a concentration on the use of the Adaptive Optics Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope (AOSLO). It first covers the background and the overall approaches to human AO retinal imaging, and the technology involved, and then concentrates on using AO retinal imaging to study the structure and function of the retina.","['1 800E.
