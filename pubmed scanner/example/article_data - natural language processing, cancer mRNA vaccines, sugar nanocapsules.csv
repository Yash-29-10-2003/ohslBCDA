0,Enhanced Tumor Synergistic Therapy by Injectable Magnetic Hydrogel Mediated Generation of Hyperthermia and Highly Toxic Reactive Oxygen Species,"Nanoparticle-mediated tumor magnetic induction hyperthermia has received tremendous attention. However, it has been a challenge to improve the efficacy at 42 °C therapeutic temperatures without resistance to induced thermal stress. Therefore, we designed a magnetic hydrogel nanozyme (MHZ) utilizing inclusion complexation between PEGylated nanoparticles and α-cyclodextrin, which can enhance tumor oxidative stress levels by generating reactive oxygen species through nanozyme-catalyzed reactions based on tumor magnetic hyperthermia. MHZ can be injected and diffused into the tumor tissue due to shear thinning as well as magnetocaloric phase transition properties, and magnetic heat generated by the Fe3O4 first gives 42 °C of hyperthermia to the tumor. Fe3O4 nanozyme exerts peroxidase-like properties in the acidic environment of tumor to generate hydroxyl radicals (•OH) by the Fenton reaction. The hyperthermia promotes the enzymatic activity of Fe3O4 nanozyme to produce more •OH. Simultaneously, •OH further damages the protective heat shock protein 70, which is highly expressed in hyperthermia to enhance the therapeutic effect of hyperthermia. This single magnetic nanoparticle exerts dual functions of hyperthermia and catalytic therapy to synergistically treat tumors, overcoming the resistance of tumor cells to induced thermal stress without causing severe side effects to normal tissues at 42 °C hyperthermia.","[""1 State Key Laboratory of Bioelectronics, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Biomaterials and Devices, School of Biological Science and Medical Engineering & Collaborative Innovation Center of Suzhou Nano Science and Technology , Southeast University , Nanjing 210096 , People's Republic of China."", ""2 Department of Pathology , Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University , Shanghai 200032 , People's Republic of China."", ""3 Department of Radiology , Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine , Nanjing 210029 , People's Republic of China.""]","Haoan Wu, Lei Liu, Lina Song, Ming Ma, Ning Gu, Yu Zhang, ",ACS nano,2019,breast cancer; hyperthermia; magnetic nanoparticles; nanozyme; supramolecular hydrogel.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31639298
1,Itraconazole encapsulated PLGA-nanoparticles covered with mannose as potential candidates against leishmaniasis,"Leishmaniasis is a neglected disease threatening over 350 million people. Antimonials are first-line drugs due to resistance and side effects there is a demand for alternative chemotherapy. Itraconazole (ITZ) is an antimycotic. It was encapsulated into poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) and covered with mannose. The NPs were 250 nm and -1.1 mV ± 0.7. PLGA-ITZ-mannose NPs presented a toxicity of 20.7% for J774 cells, and no toxicity for THP 1. The J774 cells were infected with three Leishmania promastigotes strains and treated with ITZ loaded PLGA NPs with/without mannose. The parasite percentage of L.(V.) panamensis intracellular amastigotes significantly (p < 0.01) decreased from 34.4% to 13.7% and 5.7% for PLGA-ITZ-mannose NPs and PLGA-ITZ NPs, respectively. For L.(L.) infantum there was a reduction (p < 0.001) from 18.1% to 4.8% and 8.3% for PLGA-ITZ-mannose NPs and PLGA-ITZ NPs, respectively. Further with L.(L.) braziliensis amastigotes there was a significant reduction (p < 0.001) from 54.9% to 28% and 21.1% for PLGA-ITZ-mannose NPs and PLGA-ITZ NPs, respectively. Adding mannose increased the efficacy PLGA-ITZ NPs against L.(L.) infantum, while it had no effect against L(V.) panamensis and L.(L.) braziliensis amastigotes. We recommend further investigation of PLGA-ITZ-mannose NPs in animal models to evaluate their potential. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

2,"Insulin Delivery from Glucose-Responsive, Self-Assembled, Polyamine Nanoparticles: Smart ""Sense-and-Treat"" Nanocarriers Made Easy","Polyamine-salt aggregates (PSA) are biomimetic soft materials that have attracted great attention due to their straightforward fabrication methods, high drug-loading efficiencies, and attractive properties for pH-triggered release. Herein, a simple and fast multicomponent self-assembly process was used to construct cross-linked poly(allylamine hydrochloride)/phosphate PSAs (hydrodynamic diameter of 360 nm) containing glucose oxidase enzyme, as a glucose-responsive element, and human recombinant insulin, as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of diabetes mellitus (GI-PSA). The addition of increasing glucose concentrations promotes the release of insulin due to the disassembly of the GI-PSAs triggered by the catalytic in situ formation of gluconic acid. Under normoglycemia, the GI-PSA integrity remained intact for at least 24 h, whereas hyperglycemic conditions resulted in 100 % cargo release after 4 h of glucose addition. This entirely supramolecular strategy presents great potential for the construction of smart glucose-responsive delivery nanocarriers.","['1 Instituto de Investigaciones Fisicoquímicas Teóricas y, Aplicadas Facultad de Ciencias Exactas, Universidad Nacional de La, Plata-CONICET Sucursal, 4, Casilla de Correo 16, 1900, La Plata, Argentina.', '2 Departamento de Química Inorgánica, Analítica y Química Física, INQUIMAE-CONICET, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Ciudad Universitaria, Pabellón 2, Buenos Aires, C1428EHA, Argentina.']","Maximiliano L Agazzi, Santiago E Herrera, M Lorena Cortez, Waldemar A Marmisollé, Mario Tagliazucchi, Omar Azzaroni, ","Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2020,drug delivery; molecular recognition; nanostructures; self-assembly; supramolecular chemistry.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31889346
3,Antidiabetic activity enhancement in streptozotocin + nicotinamide-induced diabetic rats through combinational polymeric nanoformulation,"Background: The bioactive compounds glycyrrhizin (GL) and thymoquinone (TQ) have been reported for antidiabetic activity in pure and nanoformulation (NF) form. However, the antidiabetic effect of a combined nanoformulation of these two has not been reported in the literature. Here, a combinational nanomedicine approach was investigated to enhance the antidiabetic effects of the two bioactive compounds of GL and TQ (GT), in type 2 diabetic rats in reference to metformin. Methods: Two separately prepared NFs of GL (using polymeric nanoparticles) and TQ (using polymeric nanocapsules) were mixed to obtain a therapeutic cargo of nanomedicine and then characterized with respect to particle size, stability, morphology, chemical interaction, and in vivo behavior. Additionally, NFs were evaluated for their cytotoxic effect on Vero cell lines compared to the pure form. This nanomedicine was administered orally, both independently and in combination (pure form or NF) for 21 successive days to type 2 diabetic rats and the effect assessed in term of body weight, fasting blood-glucose level, and various biochemical parameters (such as lipid-profile parameters and HbA1c). Results: When these nanomedicines were applied in combined rather than individual forms, significant decreases in blood glucose and HbA1c and significant improvements in body weight and lipid profile were observed, despite them containing lower amounts than the pure forms. The treatment of diabetic rats with GL and TQ, when administered independently in either pure or NF forms, did not lead to favorable trends in any studied parameters. Conclusion: The administration of combined GT NFs exhibited significant improvement in studied parameters. Improvements in antidiabetic activity could have been due to a synergistic effect of combined NFs, leading to enhanced absorption of NFs and lesser cytotoxic effects compared to pure bioactive compounds. Therefore, GT NFs demonstrated potential as a new medicinal agent for the management of diabetes.","['1 Department of Bio and Nano Technology, Guru Jambheshwar University of Science and Technology, Hisar 125001, India.', '2 Department of Pharmaceutical Science, Guru Jambheshwar University of Science and Technology, Hisar 125001, India.', '3 Center for Personalized Nanomedicine, Institute of NeuroImmune Pharmacology, Department of Immunology and Nano-Medicine, Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine, Florida International University (FIU), Miami, FL 33199, USA.', '4 Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul 04763, South Korea.']","Ruma Rani, Shakti Dahiya, Dinesh Dhingra, Neeraj Dilbaghi, Ajeet Kaushik, Ki-Hyun Kim, Sandeep Kumar, ",International journal of nanomedicine,2019,antidiabetic; glycated hemoglobin; glycyrrhizin; lipid profile; nanoformulation; thymoquinone.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31354267
4,Sugar-Nanocapsules Imprinted with Microbial Molecular Patterns for mRNA Vaccination,"Innate immune cells recognize and respond to pathogen-associated molecular patterns. In particular, polysaccharides found in the microbial cell wall are potent activators of dendritic cells (DCs). Here, we report a new class of nanocapsules, termed sugar-capsules, entirely composed of polysaccharides derived from the microbial cell wall. We show that sugar-capsules with a flexible polysaccharide shell and a hollow core efficiently drain to lymph nodes and activate DCs. In particular, sugar-capsules composed of mannan (Mann-capsule) carrying mRNA (mRNA) promote strong DC activation, mRNA translation, and antigen presentation on DCs. Mann-capsules elicit robust antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8α+ T-cell responses with antitumor efficacy in vivo. The strategy presented in this study is generally applicable for utilizing pathogen-derived molecular patterns for vaccines and immunotherapies.","['1 Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, United States.', '2 Biointerfaces Institute, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, United States.', ""3 Center for Nanomedicine and Department of Anesthesiology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, United States."", '4 Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, United States.']","Sejin Son, Jutaek Nam, Ilia Zenkov, Lukasz J Ochyl, Yao Xu, Lindsay Scheetz, Jinjun Shi, Omid C Farokhzad, James J Moon, ",Nano letters,2020,dendritic cell; mRNA; nanoparticle; polysaccharide; vaccine.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32023415
5,Apatite nanoparticles mediate intracellular delivery of trehalose and increase survival of cryopreserved cells,"Cryopreservation of tissue cells is an important method to maintain cell viability and cellular function. However, cell viability and function are less than ideal by conventional cell cryopreservation methods, which may result in apoptosis and necrosis of cells in cryopreservation. Trehalose plays a role in maintaining cell structure and protecting cells from stress. However, owing to the difficulty in transport of trehalose across the cell membrane, its antifreeze effect is limited. A large amount of trehalose (up to 237 ± 8.5 mM) can be delivered to smooth muscle cells incubated in a medium containing trehalose and apatite nanomaterials at 37 °C for 6 h. Our data showed that trehalose was efficiently delivered intracellularly with the aid of nanoparticles (NP), with a loading efficiency up to 137.3 ± 34.5%, thus allowing for cryopreservation of LMC with nontoxic sugar as the sole cryoprotectant. Colloidal bioelastic apatite NP were used as bioactive promoters for the cryopreservation of tissue cells with trehalose. The addition of apatite NP in the medium substantially increased aortic smooth muscle cell cryosurvival, up to 83.6% (30% improvement over control without NP), a level comparable to that associated with the traditional Me2SO cryoprotective regimen. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity of nanocapsules in the intracellular delivery of trehalose was negligible. This method provides a new option to enhance the activity of valvular cells for cryopreservation.","['1 Qingdao University, Qingdao, 266071, China; Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao, 266000, China.', '2 Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao, 266000, China.', '3 Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao, 266000, China.

6,Association measures for estimating semantic similarity and relatedness between biomedical concepts,"Association measures quantify the observed likelihood a term pair co-occurs versus their predicted co-occurrence together if by chance. This is based both on the terms' individual occurrence frequencies, and their mutual co-occurrence frequencies. One application of association scores is estimating semantic relatedness, which is critical for many natural language processing applications, such as clustering of biomedical and clinical documents and the development of biomedical terminologies and ontololgies. In this paper we propose a method of generating association scores between biomedical concepts to estimate semantic relatedness. We use co-occurrence statistics between Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) concepts to account for lexical variation at the synonymous level, and introduce a process of concept expansion that exploits hierarchical information from the UMLS to account for lexical variation at the hyponymous level. State of the art results are achieved on several standard evaluation datasets, and an in depth analysis of hyper-parameters is presented.","['1 Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, United States.']","Sam Henry, Alex McQuilkin, Bridget T McInnes, ",Artificial intelligence in medicine,2019 Jan,Association measures; Natural language processing; Semantic relatedness; Semantic similarity.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30197305
7,Functionalization of GroEL nanocages with hemin for label-free colorimetric assays,"The design of functionalized protein nanocages as enzyme mimics is a relatively new and promising field as these biogenic nanocapsules are inherently monodisperse with precise architectures, unattainable by purely synthetic processes. This work explored the catalytic properties of the bacterial GroEL-nanocaged hemin and its performance in label-free colorimetric assays. It is demonstrated that the hemin-GroEL biohybrid has peroxidase-like activity and follows the typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics and ping-pong mechanism in the model sensing processes. The open nature and nanoreactor effect of the GroEL cage and the addition of ATP are shown to significantly influence the catalytic activity. For glucose detection with the hemin-GroEL complex, the linearity between the analyte concentration and UV-vis absorption was determined to range from 0 to 200 μM with a limit of detection (LOD) of ~ 12 μM under the defined conditions. In addition, the colorimetric detection of catechol led to a linear dynamic range of 0-120 μM with a LOD of ~ 17 μM. This indicates that the same assay could be used as a sensing platform for the detection or even oxidative removal of phenolic contaminants in the presence of H2O2. Thus, GroEL cage is a valuable tool for the development of nanozymes and practical applications such as clinical analysis and environmental monitoring.","['1 State Key Laboratory of Heavy Oil Processing, College of Chemical Engineering, China University of Petroleum (East China), Qingdao, 266580, Shandong, China. wangxq001@upc.edu.cn.', '2 State Key Laboratory of Heavy Oil Processing, College of Chemical Engineering, China University of Petroleum (East China), Qingdao, 266580, Shandong, China.']","Xiaoqiang Wang, Haiyan Sun, Chao Wang, ",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,2019 Jul,Catechol; Colorimetric detection; H2O2 and glucose sensing; Hemin-GroEL biohybrid; Peroxidase-like activity.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31089786
8,Dual-Targeted Lactoferrin Shell-Oily Core Nanocapsules for Synergistic Targeted/Herbal Therapy of Hepatocellular Carcinoma,"Herein, both strategies of synergistic drug combination together with dual active tumor targeting were combined for effective therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Therefore, based on the tumor sensitizing action, the herbal quercetin (QRC) was co-delivered with the targeted therapeutic drug sorafenib (SFB), preformulated as phospholipid complex, via protein shell-oily core nanocapsules (NCs). Inspired by the targeting action of lactoferrin (LF) via binding to LF receptors overexpressed by HCC cells, LF shell was electrostatically deposited onto the drug-loaded oily core to elaborate LF shell-oily core NCs. For dual tumor targeting, lactobionic acid (LA) or glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) was individually coupled to LF shell for binding to asialoglycoprotein and GA receptors on liver cancer cells, respectively. Compared to LF and GA/LF NCs, the dual-targeted LA/LF-NCs showed higher internalization into HepG2 cells with 2-fold reduction in half-maximal inhibitory concentration compared to free combination therapy after 48 h. Moreover, dual-targeted LF-NCs showed powerful in vivo antitumor efficacy. It was revealed as significant downregulation of the mRNA expression levels of nuclear factor-kappa B and tumor necrosis factor α as well as suppression of Ki-67 protein expression level in diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced HCC mice (P < 0.05). Furthermore, dual-targeted LF-NCs attenuated the liver toxicity induced by DEN in animal models. Overall, this study proposes dual-targeted LF-NCs for combined delivery of SFB and QRC as a potential therapeutic HCC strategy.","['1 Nanotechnology Program, School of Sciences & Engineering , The American University in Cairo (AUC) , New Cairo 11835 , Egypt.', '2 Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science , Alexandria University , Alexandria 21511 , Egypt.', '3 Pharmaceutics Laboratory, Graduate Institute of Natural Products , Chang Gung University , Taoyuan 333 , Taiwan.', '4 Research Center for Industry of Human Ecology, Research Center for Chinese Herbal Medicine , Chang Gung University of Science and Technology , Kweishan, Taoyuan 333 , Taiwan.', '5 Department of Anesthesiology , Chang Gung Memorial Hospital , Kweishan, Taoyuan 333 , Taiwan.', ""6 Division of Engineering in Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital , Harvard Medical School , Boston , Massachusetts 02115 , United States."", '7 Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences & Technology (HST) , Cambridge , Massachusetts 02139 , United States.']","Mona A Abdelmoneem, Manar A Elnaggar, Ruwan S Hammady, Shaza M Kamel, Maged W Helmy, Mohammad A Abdulkader, Amira Zaky, Jia-You Fang, Kadria A Elkhodairy, Ahmed O Elzoghby, ",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019,dual active targeting; glycyrrhetinic acid; hepatocellular carcinoma; lactobionic acid; lactoferrin nanocapsules; synergistic drug combination.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31268657
9,Predicting the Efficacy and Safety of TACTICs (Tumor Angiogenesis-Specific CAR-T Cells Impacting Cancers) Therapy for Soft Tissue Sarcoma Patients,"Soft tissue sarcomas (STSs) are heterogeneous and aggressive malignancies with few effective therapies available. We have developed T cells expressing a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2)-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) to establish a tumor angiogenesis-specific CAR-T cells impacting cancers (TACTICs) therapy. In this study, we optimized the manufacturing and transportation of mRNA-transfected anti-VEGFR2 CAR-T cells and collected information that allowed the extrapolation of the efficacy and safety potential of TACTICs therapy for STS patients. Although 5-methoxyuridines versus uridines did not improve CAR-mRNA stability in T cells, the utilization of CleanCap as a 5' cap-structure extended the CAR expression level, increasing VEGFR2-specific cytotoxicity. Furthermore, 4 °C preservation conditions did not affect the viability/cytotoxicity of CAR-T cells, contrarily to a freeze-thaw approach. Importantly, immunohistochemistry showed that most of the STS patients' specimens expressed VEGFR2, suggesting a great potential of our TACTICs approach. However, VEGFR2 expression was also detected in normal tissues, stressing the importance of the application of a strict monitoring schedule to detect (and respond to) the occurrence of adverse effects in clinics. Overall, our results support the development of a ""first in humans"" study to evaluate the potential of our TACTICs therapy as a new treatment option for STSs.","['1 Project for Vaccine and Immune Regulation, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Osaka University, Suita 565-0871, Japan.', '2 MEDINET Co.

10,Genital infections due to the human papillomavirus,"The Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is a double-stranded DNA virus, with more than 200 different genotypes having been identified. This infection is considered the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI), and it is the cause of a significant number of diseases, both benign lesions (anogenital condylomas) and pre-malignant lesions and different cancers. The diagnosis of the infection is performed by molecular techniques based on the detection of viral DNA, the mRNA of oncogenic proteins and cellular alteration caused by the infection. Although there is no consensus regarding the best treatment, this should be individualised, and there are different options with ablative treatments being more effective but with greater recurrences, and immunomodulatory treatments being less effective in the short term but with fewer recurrences. Among the preventive strategies, vaccination against HPV is the best strategy against anogenital neoplasms and warts, its maximum effectiveness being when it is administered prior to exposure to HPV.","['1 Servicio de Dermatología, Hospital Universitario La Paz, Madrid, España.', ""2 Servicio de Enfermedades Infecciosas, Hospital Universitario Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona, España."", '3 Servicio de Microbiología, Hospital Universitario Puerta del Mar, Cádiz, España.

      This work describes the Medication and Adverse Drug Events from Electronic Health Records (MADE 1.0) corpus and provides an overview of the MADE 1.0 2018 challenge for extracting medication, indication, and adverse drug events (ADEs) from electronic health record (EHR) notes. Objective:
      
    

    
      The goal of MADE is to provide a set of common evaluation tasks to assess the state of the art for natural language processing (NLP) systems applied to EHRs supporting drug safety surveillance and pharmacovigilance. We also provide benchmarks on the MADE dataset using the system submissions received in the MADE 2018 challenge. Methods:
      
    

    
      The MADE 1.0 challenge has released an expert-annotated cohort of medication and ADE information comprising 1089 fully de-identified longitudinal EHR notes from 21 randomly selected patients with cancer at the University of Massachusetts Memorial Hospital. Using this cohort as a benchmark, the MADE 1.0 challenge designed three shared NLP tasks. The named entity recognition (NER) task identifies medications and their attributes (dosage, route, duration, and frequency), indications, ADEs, and severity. The relation identification (RI) task identifies relations between the named entities: medication-indication, medication-ADE, and attribute relations. The third shared task (NER-RI) evaluates NLP models that perform the NER and RI tasks jointly. In total, 11 teams from four countries participated in at least one of the three shared tasks, and 41 system submissions were received in total. Results:
      
    

    
      The best systems F1 scores for NER, RI, and NER-RI were 0.82, 0.86, and 0.61, respectively. Ensemble classifiers using the team submissions improved the performance further, with an F1 score of 0.85, 0.87, and 0.66 for the three tasks, respectively. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      MADE results show that recent progress in NLP has led to remarkable improvements in NER and RI tasks for the clinical domain. However, some room for improvement remains, particularly in the NER-RI task.","['1 College of Information and Computer Sciences, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA.', '2 Department of Quantitative Health Sciences and Radiology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA.', '3 Department of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts, 220 Pawtucket St., Lowell, MA, 01854-2874, USA.', '4 Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA.', '5 College of Information and Computer Sciences, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA. hong.yu@umassmed.edu.', '6 Department of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts, 220 Pawtucket St., Lowell, MA, 01854-2874, USA. hong.yu@umassmed.edu.', '7 Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA. hong.yu@umassmed.edu.', '8 Bedford VAMC, Bedford, MA, USA. hong.yu@umassmed.edu.']","Abhyuday Jagannatha, Feifan Liu, Weisong Liu, Hong Yu, ",Drug safety,2019 Jan,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30649735

14,Metformin hydrochloride and wound healing: from nanoformulation to pharmacological evaluation,"Niosomes as drug delivery systems have the ability to decrease drugs' side effects and increase their therapeutic effectiveness. Metformin HCl is an oral antihyperglycemic agent belonging to biguanides. It is the most commonly chosen drug as a startup therapy for patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. This study aims to encapsulate metformin HCl inside niosomes to be used as a transdermal formulation helping to prolong its antidiabetic effect and investigate its ability to enhance wound healing in diabetic patients. Thin film hydration method was used to prepare metformin HCl niosomes using different proportions of Span 60, Span 40, Tween 80, and cholesterol. All formulations were characterized using transmission electron microscope, zeta potential, and vesicle size. In vitro release studies, stability studies and in vivo evaluation were conducted on selected niosomal formulations. The results of entrapment efficiency ranged from 13% to 32%.

16,Attenuate Newcastle disease virus by codon modification of the glycoproteins and phosphoprotein genes,"A codon modification strategy was used to attenuate the avian pathogenicity of an oncolytic mesogenic Newcastle disease virus (NDV) by targeting the three major virulence factors: the fusion (F) protein, hemagglutinin neuraminidase (HN) and phosphoprotein (P). Recoding the F and HN genes with rare codons greatly reduced expression of both F and HN proteins and resulted in their low incorporation into virions. The F and HN recoded virus was partially attenuated in chickens even when the F protein cleavage site was modified. Full attenuation was achieved when the 5' portion of the P gene was recoded. The recoded P, F and HN triple gene mutant exhibited delayed cell death in human cancer cells with prolonged expression of a GFP transgene. While this engineered attenuated NDV strain has lower oncolytic potency, its capacity for prolonged transgene expression may allow its use as a vaccine or gene delivery vector.","['1 MedImmune LLC, 121 Oyster Point Boulevard, South San Francisco, CA, USA.', '2 MedImmune LLC, One Medimmune Way, Gaithersburg, MD, USA.', '3 MedImmune LLC, 121 Oyster Point Boulevard, South San Francisco, CA, USA.

18,EXTraction of EMR numerical data: an efficient and generalizable tool to EXTEND clinical research,"Background:
      
    

    
      Electronic medical records (EMR) contain numerical data important for clinical outcomes research, such as vital signs and cardiac ejection fractions (EF), which tend to be embedded in narrative clinical notes. In current practice, this data is often manually extracted for use in research studies. However, due to the large volume of notes in datasets, manually extracting numerical data often becomes infeasible. The objective of this study is to develop and validate a natural language processing (NLP) tool that can efficiently extract numerical clinical data from narrative notes. Results:
      
    

    
      To validate the accuracy of the tool EXTraction of EMR Numerical Data (EXTEND), we developed a reference standard by manually extracting vital signs from 285 notes, EF values from 300 notes, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C), and serum creatinine from 890 notes. For each parameter of interest, we calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and F1 score of EXTEND using two metrics. (1) completion of data extraction, and (2) accuracy of data extraction compared to the actual values in the note verified by chart review. At the note level, extraction by EXTEND was considered correct only if it accurately detected and extracted all values of interest in a note. Using manually-annotated labels as the gold standard, the note-level accuracy of EXTEND in capturing the numerical vital sign values, EF, HbA1C and creatinine ranged from 0.88 to 0.95 for sensitivity, 0.95 to 1.0 for specificity, 0.95 to 1.0 for PPV, 0.89 to 0.99 for NPV, and 0.92 to 0.96 in F1 scores. Compared to the actual value level, the sensitivity, PPV, and F1 score of EXTEND ranged from 0.91 to 0.95, 0.95 to 1.0 and 0.95 to 0.96. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      EXTEND is an efficient, flexible tool that uses knowledge-based rules to extract clinical numerical parameters with high accuracy. By increasing dictionary terms and developing new rules, the usage of EXTEND can easily be expanded to extract additional numerical data important in clinical outcomes research.","[""1 Division of Rheumatology, Immunology, and Allergy, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, 6016BB, 60 Fenwood Road, Boston, 02115, USA. tcai1@bwh.harvard.edu."", '2 Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA. tcai1@bwh.harvard.edu.', '3 Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', ""4 Division of Rheumatology, Immunology, and Allergy, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, 6016BB, 60 Fenwood Road, Boston, 02115, USA."", '5 Department of Radiology, School of Medicine, Juntendo University, Tokyo, Japan.', '6 Department of Radiology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada.', '7 Harvard T.H.

19,Validity of Natural Language Processing for Ascertainment of EGFR and ALK Test Results in SEER Cases of Stage IV Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      SEER registries do not report results of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) mutation tests. To facilitate population-based research in molecularly defined subgroups of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we assessed the validity of natural language processing (NLP) for the ascertainment of EGFR and ALK testing from electronic pathology (e-path) reports of NSCLC cases included in two SEER registries: the Cancer Surveillance System (CSS) and the Kentucky Cancer Registry (KCR). Methods:
      
    

    
      We obtained 4,278 e-path reports from 1,634 patients who were diagnosed with stage IV nonsquamous NSCLC from September 1, 2011, to December 31, 2013, included in CSS. We used 855 CSS reports to train NLP systems for the ascertainment of EGFR and ALK test status (reported v not reported) and test results (positive v negative). We assessed sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values in an internal validation sample of 3,423 CSS e-path reports and repeated the analysis in an external sample of 1,041 e-path reports from 565 KCR patients. Two oncologists manually reviewed all e-path reports to generate gold-standard data sets. Results:
      
    

    
      NLP systems yielded internal validity metrics that ranged from 0.95 to 1.00 for EGFR and ALK test status and results in CSS e-path reports. NLP showed high internal accuracy for the ascertainment of EGFR and ALK in CSS patients-F scores of 0.95 and 0.96, respectively. In the external validation analysis, NLP yielded metrics that ranged from 0.02 to 0.96 in KCR reports and F scores of 0.70 and 0.72, respectively, in KCR patients. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      NLP is an internally valid method for the ascertainment of EGFR and ALK test information from e-path reports available in SEER registries, but future work is necessary to increase NLP external validity.","['1 Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', '2 University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', '3 University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY.']","Bernardo Haddock Lobo Goulart, Emily T Silgard, Christina S Baik, Aasthaa Bansal, Qin Sun, Eric B Durbin, Isaac Hands, Darshil Shah, Susanne M Arnold, Scott D Ramsey, Ramakanth Kavuluru, Stephen M Schwartz, ",JCO clinical cancer informatics,2019 May,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31058542
20,Nanoparticle Delivery of MnO 2 and Antiangiogenic Therapy to Overcome Hypoxia-Driven Tumor Escape and Suppress Hepatocellular Carcinoma,"Antiangiogenic therapy is widely administered in many cancers, and the antiangiogenic drug sorafenib offers moderate benefits in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, antiangiogenic therapy can also lead to hypoxia-driven angiogenesis and immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and metastasis. Here, we report the synthesis and evaluation of NanoMnSor, a tumor-targeted, nanoparticle drug carrier that efficiently codelivers oxygen-generating MnO2 and sorafenib into HCC. We found that MnO2 not only alleviates hypoxia by catalyzing the decomposition of H2O2 to oxygen but also enhances pH/redox-responsive T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and drug-release properties upon decomposition into Mn2+ ions in the TME. Moreover, macrophages exposed to MnO2 displayed increased mRNA associated with the immunostimulatory M1 phenotype. We further show that NanoMnSor treatment leads to sorafenib-induced decrease in tumor vascularization and significantly suppresses primary tumor growth and distal metastasis, resulting in improved overall survival in a mouse orthotopic HCC model. Furthermore, NanoMnSor reprograms the immunosuppressive TME by reducing the hypoxia-induced tumor infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages, promoting macrophage polarization toward the immunostimulatory M1 phenotype, and increasing the number of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells in tumors, thereby augmenting the efficacy of anti-PD-1 antibody and whole-cell cancer vaccine immunotherapies. Our study demonstrates the potential of oxygen-generating nanoparticles to deliver antiangiogenic agents, efficiently modulate the hypoxic TME, and overcome hypoxia-driven drug resistance, thereby providing therapeutic benefit in cancer.","['1 Institute of Biomedical Engineering and Frontier Research Center on Fundamental and Applied Sciences of Matters, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan.', '2 Department of Biomedical Engineering and Environmental Sciences, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan.', '3 Department of Chemical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan.', '4 Center for Advanced Molecular Imaging and Translation, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan 333, Taiwan.']","Chih-Chun Chang, Trinh Kieu Dinh, Yi-An Lee, Fu-Nien Wang, Yun-Chieh Sung, Pei-Lun Yu, Shao-Chieh Chiu, Yu-Chuan Shih, Cheng-Yun Wu, Yi-Da Huang, Jane Wang, Tsai-Te Lu, Dehui Wan, Yunching Chen, ",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2020,MnO2; antiangiogenic therapy; hepatocellular carcinoma; hypoxia; immunotherapy; tumor-associated macrophage.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32865389

Lifestyle modification data are not easily retrieved or used in research due to their textual nature. This study addresses this knowledge gap using natural language processing to automatically identify lifestyle modification documentation from electronic health records. Electronic health record notes from hypertension patients were analyzed using an open-source natural language processing tool to retrieve assessment and advice regarding lifestyle modification. These data were classified as lifestyle modification assessment or advice and mapped to a coded standard ontology. Combined lifestyle modification (advice and assessment) recall was 99.27 percent, precision 94.44 percent, and correct classification 88.15 percent. Through extraction and transformation of narrative lifestyle modification data to coded data, this critical information can be used in research, metric development, and quality improvement efforts regarding care delivery for multiple medical conditions that benefit from lifestyle modification.","['1 University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, USA.', '2 University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA.']","Kimberly Shoenbill, Yiqiang Song, Lisa Gress, Heather Johnson, Maureen Smith, Eneida A Mendonca, ",Health informatics journal,2020 Mar,electronic health records; health behavior; hypertension; lifestyle; natural language processing; text mining.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30791802

24,Nanoparticles for nucleic acid delivery: Applications in cancer immunotherapy,"Immunotherapy has recently emerged as a powerful tool for cancer treatment. Early clinical successes from cancer immunotherapy have led to a growing list of FDA approvals, and many new therapies are in clinical and preclinical development. Nucleic acid therapeutics, including DNA, mRNA, and genome editing systems, hold significant potential as a form of immunotherapy due to its robust use in cancer vaccination, adoptive T-cell therapy, and gene regulation. However, these therapeutics must overcome numerous delivery obstacles to be successful, including rapid in vivo degradation, poor uptake into target cells, required nuclear entry, and potential in vivo toxicity in healthy cells and tissues. Nanoparticle delivery systems have been engineered to overcome several of these barriers as a means to safely and effectively deliver nucleic acid therapeutics to immune cells.

25,Lipid-Based Vectors for Therapeutic mRNA-Based Anti-Cancer Vaccines,"Cancer vaccines have been widely explored as a key tool for effective cancer immunotherapy. Despite a convincing rationale behind cancer vaccines, extensive past efforts were unsuccessful in mediating significantly relevant anti-tumor activity in clinical studies. One of the major reasons for such poor outcome, among others, is the low immunogenicity of more traditional vaccines, such as peptide-, protein- and DNA- based vaccines. Recently, mRNA emerged as a promising alternative to traditional vaccine strategies due to its high immunogenicity, suitability for large-scale and low-cost production, and superior safety profile. However, the clinical application of mRNA-based anti-cancer vaccines has been limited by their instability and inefficient in vivo delivery. Recent technological advances have now largely overcome these issues and lipid-based vectors have demonstrated encouraging results as mRNA vaccine platforms against several types of cancers. This review intends to provide a detailed overview of lipid-based vectors for the development of therapeutic mRNA-based anti-tumor vaccines.","['1 Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom.', '2 Nanomaterials for Biomedical Applications, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT), Genova, Italy.', '3 Dipartimento di Scienze e Tecnologie Biologiche ed Ambientali (DiSTeBA), University of Salento, Lecce, Italy.']","Maria L Guevara, Stefano Persano, Francesca Persano, ",Current pharmaceutical design,2019,Cancer; immunotherapy; liposome; mRNA; nanoparticles; non-viral vectors; vaccines..,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31258071

Herein, we investigated the direct actions of LNCs on human immune cells, to guide their therapeutic application. Materials & methods: LNC's uptake, cytokine release, cell migration, proliferation and intracellular pathways under inflammatory stimulation were investigated. Results & conclusion: LNCs quickly penetrated leukocytes without cytotoxicity; inhibited mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation, cytokine release and leukocyte migration under inflammatory stimulation, which were associated with inhibition of the MAP kinase pathway and intracellular calcium influx. Hence, we showed LNCs as a down-regulatory agent on immune cells, suggesting that either the particles themselves or their application as a drug carrier can halt non-desired inflammatory processes.","['1 Department of Clinical & Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of São Paulo,\xa0Brazil.', '2 Department of Organic Chemistry, Postgraduate Program in Chemistry, Institute of Chemistry, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre,\xa0Brazil.', '3 Department of Fundamental Chemistry, Institute of Chemistry, University of São Paulo,\xa0Brazil.', '4 Department of Production and Control of Pharmaceutics; Postgraduate Program in Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.']","Silvana Sandri, Cristina Bichels Hebeda, Rodrigo Azevedo Loiola, Selma Calgaroto, Mayara Klimuk Uchiyama, Koiti Araki, Luiza Abrahão Frank, Karina Paese, Silvia Stanisçuaski Guterres, Adriana Raffin Pohlmann, Sandra Helena Poliselli Farsky, ","Nanomedicine (London, England)",2019 Jun,MAPK signaling; cell migration; cytokines release; immunosuppression; peripheral blood mononuclear cells; polymorphonuclear cells.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31169450

29,"Task definition, annotated dataset, and supervised natural language processing models for symptom extraction from unstructured clinical notes","Introduction:
      
    

    
      Machine learning (ML) and natural language processing have great potential to improve information extraction (IE) within electronic medical records (EMRs) for a wide variety of clinical search and summarization tools. Despite ML advancements, clinical adoption of real time IE tools for patient care remains low. Clinically motivated IE task definitions, publicly available annotated clinical datasets, and inclusion of subtasks such as coreference resolution and named entity normalization are critical for the development of useful clinical tools. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      We provide a task definition and comprehensive annotation requirements for a clinically motivated symptom extraction task. Four annotators labeled symptom mentions within 1108 discharge summaries from two public clinical note datasets for the tasks of named entity recognition, coreference resolution, and named entity normalization; these annotations will be released to the public. Baseline human performance was assessed and two ML models were evaluated on the symptom extraction task. Results:
      
    

    
      16,922 symptom mentions were identified within the discharge summaries, with 11,944 symptom instances after coreference resolution and 1255 unique normalized answer forms. Human annotator performance averaged 92.2% F1. Recurrent network model performance was 85.6% F1 (recall 85.8%, precision 85.4%), and Transformer-based model performance was 86.3% F1 (recall 86.6%, precision 86.1%). Our models extracted vague symptoms, acronyms, typographical errors, and grouping statements. The models generalized effectively to a separate clinical note corpus and can run in real time. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      To our knowledge, this dataset will be the largest and most comprehensive publicly released, annotated dataset for clinically motivated symptom extraction, as it includes annotations for named entity recognition, coreference, and normalization for more than 1000 clinical documents. Our neural network models extracted symptoms from unstructured clinical free text at near human performance in real time. In this paper, we present a clinically motivated task definition, dataset, and simple supervised natural language processing models to demonstrate the feasibility of building clinically applicable information extraction tools.","['1 Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02215, United States.

30,Natural language processing to facilitate breast cancer research and management,"The medical literature has been growing exponentially, and its size has become a barrier for physicians to locate and extract clinically useful information. As a promising solution, natural language processing (NLP), especially machine learning (ML)-based NLP is a technology that potentially provides a promising solution. ML-based NLP is based on training a computational algorithm with a large number of annotated examples to allow the computer to ""learn"" and ""predict"" the meaning of human language. Although NLP has been widely applied in industry and business, most physicians still are not aware of the huge potential of this technology in medicine, and the implementation of NLP in breast cancer research and management is fairly limited. With a real-world successful project of identifying penetrance papers for breast and other cancer susceptibility genes, this review illustrates how to train and evaluate an NLP-based medical abstract classifier, incorporate it into a semiautomatic meta-analysis procedure, and validate the effectiveness of this procedure. Other implementations of NLP technology in breast cancer research, such as parsing pathology reports and mining electronic healthcare records, are also discussed.

A Prospective Pilot Observational Study in Greek Women,"The objective of this study was to investigate the hypothesis that HPV vaccination administered in patients with low-grade (LG) cytology shortly after an initial colposcopic assessment could prospectively alter HPV-related biomarkers. This was a prospective pilot observational study involving women attending a colposcopy clinic for evaluation of abnormal LG cytology that were advised to undergo HPV vaccination and proceeded accordingly. These women were compared with a matched unvaccinated group. Women requiring cervical biopsies or CIN treatment were excluded. Intervention:
      
    

    
      A full three-dose HPV vaccination was undertaken with either the 2-valent or the 4-valent anti-HPV VLP vaccine. LBC samples were obtained prior and after the completion of the vaccination regimen and tested for HPV DNA genotyping (CLART-2 HPV test) and E6 and E7 mRNA (NASBA technique). Results:

      A total of 309 women were included in the analysis. One hundred fifty-two women received the vaccine. HPV vaccination reduced in a statistically significant manner (p < 0.05) HPV DNA positivity rates for genotypes 16, 18, and 31, RR = 1.6 (95% CI: 1.1 to 2.3), RR = 1.7 (95% CI: 1.1 to 2.8), and RR = 1.8 (95% CI: 1.0 to 2.9), in women who only tested DNA-positive for HPV16, 18, and 31 genotypes, respectively, prior to vaccination. A less pronounced, statistically insignificant reduction was shown for women who tested positive for both HPV DNA and mRNA E6 and E7 expression for HPV16, 18, and 33 subtypes. Statistically significant reduction in HPV mRNA positivity was solely documented for genotype 31 (p = 0.0411). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      HPV vaccination appears to significantly affect the rates of HPV16, 18, and 31 DNA-positive infections in the population testing HPV DNA-positive for the aforementioned genotypes.

Here, we show that MLCs can query EHRs in a manner similar to the hypothetico-deductive reasoning used by physicians and unearth associations that previous statistical methods have not found. Our model applies an automated natural language processing system using deep learning techniques to extract clinically relevant information from EHRs. In total, 101.6 million data points from 1,362,559 pediatric patient visits presenting to a major referral center were analyzed to train and validate the framework. Our model demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy across multiple organ systems and is comparable to experienced pediatricians in diagnosing common childhood diseases. Our study provides a proof of concept for implementing an AI-based system as a means to aid physicians in tackling large amounts of data, augmenting diagnostic evaluations, and to provide clinical decision support in cases of diagnostic uncertainty or complexity. Although this impact may be most evident in areas where healthcare providers are in relative shortage, the benefits of such an AI system are likely to be universal.","[""1 Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China."", '2 Institute for Genomic Medicine, Institute of Engineering in Medicine, and Shiley Eye Institute, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', '3 Hangzhou YITU Healthcare Technology Co.

34,Nanovaccines for cancer immunotherapy,"The past few decades have witnessed the booming field of cancer immunotherapy. Cancer therapeutic vaccines, either alone or in combination with other immunotherapies such as adoptive cell therapy or immune checkpoint blockade therapy, are an attractive class of cancer immunotherapeutics. However, cancer vaccines have thus far shown suboptimal efficacy in the clinic. Nanomedicines offer unique opportunities to improve the efficacy of these vaccines. A variety of nanoplatforms have been investigated to deliver molecular or cellular or subcellular vaccines to target lymphoid tissues and cells, thereby promoting the potency and durability of anti-tumor immunity while reducing adverse side effects. In this article, we reviewed the key parameters and features of nanovaccines for cancer immunotherapy; we highlighted recent advances in the development of cancer nanovaccines based on synthetic nanocarriers, biogenic nanocarriers, as well as semi-biogenic nanocarriers; and we summarized newly emerging types of nanovaccines, such as those based on stimulator of interferon genes agonists, cancer neoantigens, mRNA vaccines, as well as artificial antigen-presenting cells.

35,Natural Language Processing Approaches to Detect the Timeline of Metastatic Recurrence of Breast Cancer,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      Electronic medical records (EMRs) and population-based cancer registries contain information on cancer outcomes and treatment, yet rarely capture information on the timing of metastatic cancer recurrence, which is essential to understand cancer survival outcomes. We developed a natural language processing (NLP) system to identify patient-specific timelines of metastatic breast cancer recurrence. Patients and methods:
      
    

    
      We used the OncoSHARE database, which includes merged data from the California Cancer Registry and EMRs of 8,956 women diagnosed with breast cancer in 2000 to 2018. We curated a comprehensive vocabulary by interviewing expert clinicians and processing radiology and pathology reports and progress notes. We developed and evaluated the following two distinct NLP approaches to analyze free-text notes: a traditional rule-based model, using rules for metastatic detection from the literature and curated by domain experts; and a contemporary neural network model. For each 3-month period (quarter) from 2000 to 2018, we applied both models to infer recurrence status for that quarter. We trained the NLP models using 894 randomly selected patient records that were manually reviewed by clinical experts and evaluated model performance using 179 hold-out patients (20%) as a test set. Results:
      
    

    
      The median follow-up time was 19 quarters (5 years) for the training set and 15 quarters (4 years) for the test set. The neural network model predicted the timing of distant metastatic recurrence with a sensitivity of 0.83 and specificity of 0.73, outperforming the rule-based model, which had a specificity of 0.35 and sensitivity of 0.88 (P < .001). Conclusion:
      
    

    
      We developed an NLP method that enables identification of the occurrence and timing of metastatic breast cancer recurrence from EMRs. This approach may be adaptable to other cancer sites and could help to unlock the potential of EMRs for research on real-world cancer outcomes.","['1 Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA.']","Imon Banerjee, Selen Bozkurt, Jennifer Lee Caswell-Jin, Allison W Kurian, Daniel L Rubin, ",JCO clinical cancer informatics,2019 Oct,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31584836
36,Chitosan-Coated Lipid-Core Nanocapsules Functionalized with Gold-III and Bevacizumab Induced In Vitro Cytotoxicity against C6 Cell Line and In Vivo Potent Antiangiogenic Activity,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      Bevacizumab (BCZ) is a recombinant monoclonal antibody that inhibits the biological activity of the vascular endothelial growth factor, which has an important role in angiogenesis for tumoral growth and progression. In this way, our objective was to develop chitosan-coated lipid-core nanocapsules functionalized with BCZ by an organometallic complex using gold-III. Methods:
      
    

    
      The formulation was produced and characterized in relation to physicochemical characteristics. Furthermore, the antitumoral and antiangiogenic activities were evaluated against C6 glioma cell line and chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM), respectively. Results:
      
    

    
      Final formulation showed nanometric size, narrow polydispersity, positive zeta potential and gold clusters size lower than 2 nm. BCZ in aqueous solution (0.01-0.10 μmol L-1) did not show cytotoxic activity in vitro against C6 glioma cell line; although, MLNC-Au-BCZ showed cytotoxicity with a median inhibition concentration of 30 nmol L-1 of BCZ. Moreover, MLNC-Au-BCZ demonstrated cellular internalization dependent on incubation time and BCZ concentration. BCZ solution did not induce significant apoptosis as compared to MLNC-Au-BCZ within 24 h of treatment. CAM assay evidenced potent antiangiogenic activity for MLNC-Au-BCZ, representing a decrease of 5.6 times in BCZ dose comparing to BCZ solution. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      MLNC-Au-BCZ is a promising product for the treatment of solid tumors.","['1 Programa de Pós-Graduação em Ciências Farmacêuticas, Faculdade de Farmácia, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Av.

37,Hybrid nanovaccine for the co-delivery of the mRNA antigen and adjuvant,"For efficient cancer vaccines, the antitumor function largely relies on cytotoxic T cells, whose activation can be effectively induced via antigen-encoding mRNA, making mRNA-based cancer vaccines an attractive approach for personalized cancer therapy. While the liposome-based delivery system enables the systemic delivery and transfection of mRNA, incorporating an adjuvant that is non-lipid like remains challenging, although the co-delivery of mRNA (antigen) and effective adjuvant is key to the activation of the cytotoxic T cells. This is because the presence of an adjuvant is important for dendritic cell maturation-another necessity for cytotoxic T cell activation. In the present work, we designed a poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)-core/lipid-shell hybrid nanoparticle carrier for the co-delivery of mRNA and gardiquimod (adjuvant that cannot be incorporated into the lipid shell). We demonstrated in the present work that the co-delivery of mRNA and gardiquimod led to the effective antigen expression and DC maturation in vitro. The intravenous administration of the hybrid nanovaccine resulted in the enrichment of mRNA expression in the spleen and a strong immune response in vivo. The simultaneous delivery of the antigen and adjuvant both spatially and temporally via the core/shell nanoparticle carrier is found to be beneficial for tumor growth inhibition.","['1 Department of Physics, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong. liquan@phy.cuhk.edu.hk.']","Jingnan Yang, Smriti Arya, Pingsai Lung, Qiubin Lin, Jiandong Huang, Quan Li, ",Nanoscale,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31709434
38,Improving mRNA-Based Therapeutic Gene Delivery by Expression-Augmenting 3' UTRs Identified by Cellular Library Screening,"Synthetic mRNA has emerged as a powerful tool for the transfer of genetic information, and it is being explored for a variety of therapeutic applications. Many of these applications require prolonged intracellular persistence of mRNA to improve bioavailability of the encoded protein. mRNA molecules are intrinsically unstable and their intracellular kinetics depend on the UTRs embracing the coding sequence, in particular the 3' UTR elements. We describe here a novel and generally applicable cell-based selection process for the identification of 3' UTRs that augment the expression of proteins encoded by synthetic mRNA. Moreover, we show, for two applications of mRNA therapeutics, namely, (1) the delivery of vaccine antigens in order to mount T cell immune responses and (2) the introduction of reprogramming factors into differentiated cells in order to induce pluripotency, that mRNAs tagged with the 3' UTR elements discovered in this study outperform those with commonly used 3' UTRs.

NLP-based computational phenotyping has numerous applications including diagnosis categorization, novel phenotype discovery, clinical trial screening, pharmacogenomics, drug-drug interaction (DDI), and adverse drug event (ADE) detection, as well as genome-wide and phenome-wide association studies. Significant progress has been made in algorithm development and resource construction for computational phenotyping. Among the surveyed methods, well-designed keyword search and rule-based systems often achieve good performance. However, the construction of keyword and rule lists requires significant manual effort, which is difficult to scale. Supervised machine learning models have been favored because they are capable of acquiring both classification patterns and structures from data. Recently, deep learning and unsupervised learning have received growing attention, with the former favored for its performance and the latter for its ability to find novel phenotypes. Integrating heterogeneous data sources have become increasingly important and have shown promise in improving model performance. Often, better performance is achieved by combining multiple modalities of information.

The marine ecosystems provide diversity in natural chemicals with the potential of being exploited as medicines in the treatment of diseases. Several studies have investigated Ophiuroids as a source of anti-tumor and anti-metastatic organisms. Here, we described the inhibitory effects of an ethanolic crude extract of brittle star (Ophiocoma erinaceus) on angiogenesis and the expression level of TGF-β, VEGF, and bFGF in chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) as an experimental model. To do this 45 embryonated eggs were randomly divided into six groups including the control group, sham, three experimental groups and positive. The number and the length of vessels were calculated using ImageJ® software. The relative mRNA levels of the genes in different groups were evaluated by qRT-PCR method. Our study was suggestive of an anti-angiogenesis effect of brittle star ethanolic crude extract in a CAM model. The extract also showed a pharmacological effect of down-regulation of mRNA related to VEGF, TGF-β, and bFGF genes on chicken vascular endothelial cells. It was also showed that the observed inhibitory effect is with a dose-dependent manner in which the highest inhibitory effect belonged to the highest used dose. We indicated the anti-angiogenesis properties of the Persian Gulf brittle star.

      Natural language processing (NLP) engines such as the clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System are a solution for processing notes for research, but optimizing their performance for a clinical data warehouse remains a challenge. We aim to develop a high throughput NLP architecture using the clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System and present a predictive model use case. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      The CDW was comprised of 1 103 038 patients across 10 years. The architecture was constructed using the Hadoop data repository for source data and 3 large-scale symmetric processing servers for NLP. Each named entity mention in a clinical document was mapped to the Unified Medical Language System concept unique identifier (CUI). Results:

Furthermore, it elicits systemic and mucosal immune responses. This protects against infection at mucosal surfaces, which may further enhance protection and minimize the spread of disease. The gastrointestinal (GI) tract presents a number of prospective mucosal inductive sites for vaccine targeting, including the oral cavity, stomach, and small intestine. However, currently available oral vaccines are effectively limited to live-attenuated and inactivated vaccines against enteric diseases. The GI tract poses a number of challenges, including degradative processes that digest biologics and mucosal barriers that limit their absorption. This review summarizes the approaches currently under development and future opportunities for oral vaccine delivery to established (intestinal) and relatively new (oral cavity, stomach) mucosal targets. Special consideration is given to recent advances in oral biologic delivery that offer promise as future platforms for the administration of oral vaccines.

48,Induction of neoantigen-reactive T cells from healthy donors,"The identification of immunogenic neoantigens and their cognate T cells represents the most crucial and rate-limiting steps in the development of personalized cancer immunotherapies that are based on vaccination or on infusion of T cell receptor (TCR)-engineered T cells. Recent advances in deep-sequencing technologies and in silico prediction algorithms have allowed rapid identification of candidate neoepitopes. However, large-scale validation of putative neoepitopes and the isolation of reactive T cells are challenging because of the limited availablity of patient material and the low frequencies of neoepitope-specific T cells. Here we describe a standardized protocol for the induction of neoepitope-reactive T cells from healthy donor T cell repertoires, unaffected by the potentially immunosuppressive environment of the tumor-bearing host. Monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) transfected with mRNA encoding candidate neoepitopes are used to prime autologous naive CD8+ T cells. Antigen-specific T cells that recognize endogenously processed and presented epitopes are detected using peptide-MHC (pMHC) multimers. Single multimer-positive T cells are sorted for the identification of TCR sequences, after an optional step that includes clonal expansion and functional characterization. The time required to identify neoepitope-specific T cells is 15 d, with an additional 2-4 weeks required for clonal expansion and downstream functional characterization. Identified neoepitopes and corresponding TCRs provide candidates for use in vaccination and TCR-based cancer immunotherapies, and datasets generated by this technology should be useful for improving algorithms to predict immunogenic neoantigens.","['1 Department of Cancer Immunology, Oslo University Hospital Radiumhospitalet, Oslo, Norway.', '2 K.G.

49,Predicting inadequate postoperative pain management in depressed patients: A machine learning approach,"Widely-prescribed prodrug opioids (e.g., hydrocodone) require conversion by liver enzyme CYP-2D6 to exert their analgesic effects. The most commonly prescribed antidepressant, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), inhibits CYP-2D6 activity and therefore may reduce the effectiveness of prodrug opioids. We used a machine learning approach to identify patients prescribed a combination of SSRIs and prodrug opioids postoperatively and to examine the effect of this combination on postoperative pain control. Using EHR data from an academic medical center, we identified patients receiving surgery over a 9-year period. We developed and validated natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to extract depression-related information (diagnosis, SSRI use, symptoms) from structured and unstructured data elements. The primary outcome was the difference between preoperative pain score and postoperative pain at discharge, 3-week and 8-week time points. We developed computational models to predict the increase or decrease in the postoperative pain across the 3 time points by using the patient's EHR data (e.g. medications, vitals, demographics) captured before surgery. We evaluate the generalizability of the model using 10-fold cross-validation method where the holdout test method is repeated 10 times and mean area-under-the-curve (AUC) is considered as evaluation metrics for the prediction performance. We identified 4,306 surgical patients with symptoms of depression. A total of 14.1% were prescribed both an SSRI and a prodrug opioid, 29.4% were prescribed an SSRI and a non-prodrug opioid, 18.6% were prescribed a prodrug opioid but were not on SSRIs, and 37.5% were prescribed a non-prodrug opioid but were not on SSRIs. Our NLP algorithm identified depression with a F1 score of 0.95 against manual annotation of 300 randomly sampled clinical notes. On average, patients receiving prodrug opioids had lower average pain scores (p<0.05), with the exception of the SSRI+ group at 3-weeks postoperative follow-up. However, SSRI+/Prodrug+ had significantly worse pain control at discharge, 3 and 8-week follow-up (p < .01) compared to SSRI+/Prodrug- patients, whereas there was no difference in pain control among the SSRI- patients by prodrug opioid (p>0.05). The machine learning algorithm accurately predicted the increase or decrease of the discharge, 3-week and 8-week follow-up pain scores when compared to the pre-operative pain score using 10-fold cross validation (mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.87, 0.81, and 0.69, respectively). Preoperative pain, surgery type, and opioid tolerance were the strongest predictors of postoperative pain control. We provide the first direct clinical evidence that the known ability of SSRIs to inhibit prodrug opioid effectiveness is associated with worse pain control among depressed patients. Current prescribing patterns indicate that prescribers may not account for this interaction when choosing an opioid. The study results imply that prescribers might instead choose direct acting opioids (e.g. oxycodone or morphine) in depressed patients on SSRIs.","['1 Department of Management Science and Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California, United States of America.', '2 Department of Biomedical Data Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, California, United States of America.', '3 Department of Psychiatry, Stanford University, Stanford, California, United States of America.', '4 VA Palo Alto Center for Innovation to Implementation, Palo Alto, California, United States of America.', '5 Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California, United States of America.', '6 Department of Surgery, VA Palo Alto Healthcare System, Palo Alto, California, United States of America.', '7 Department of Surgery, Stanford University, Stanford, California, United States of America.', '8 Department of Anesthesiology, Stanford University, Stanford, California, United States of America.']","Arjun Parthipan, Imon Banerjee, Keith Humphreys, Steven M Asch, Catherine Curtin, Ian Carroll, Tina Hernandez-Boussard, ",PloS one,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30726237

51,Antigenic Re-Stimulation of Virus-Specific Memory CD8 + T Cells Requires Days of Lytic Protein Accumulation for Maximal Cytotoxic Capacity,"In various infections or vaccinations of mice or humans, reports of the persistence and the requirements for re-stimulation of the cytotoxic mediators granzyme B (GrB) and perforin (PRF) in CD8+ T cells have yielded disparate results. Here we examined the kinetics of PRF and GrB mRNA and protein expression after stimulation and associated changes in cytotoxic capacity in virus-specific memory cells in detail. In patients with controlled HIV or cleared RSV or influenza virus infections, all virus-specific CD8+ T cells expressed low PRF levels without re-stimulation. Following stimulation, they displayed similarly delayed kinetics for lytic protein expression, with significant increases occurring by days 1-3 before peaking on days 4-6. These increases were strongly correlated with, but were not dependent upon, proliferation. Incremental changes in PRF and GrB percent expression and MFI were highly correlated with increases in HIV-specific cytotoxicity. Messenger RNA levels in HIV-specific CD8+ T-cells exhibited delayed kinetics after stimulation as with protein expression, peaking on day 5. In contrast to GrB, PRF mRNA transcripts were little changed over 5 days of stimulation (94-fold versus 2.8-fold, respectively), consistent with post-transcriptional regulation. Changes in expression of some microRNAs, including miR-17, miR-150 and miR-155 suggested microRNAs might play a significant role in regulation of PRF expression. Therefore, under conditions of extremely low or absent antigen levels, memory virus-specific CD8+ T cells require prolonged stimulation over days to achieve maximal lytic protein expression and cytotoxic capacity.IMPORTANCE Antigen-specific CD8+ T cells play a major role in controlling most virus infections, primarily by perforin (PRF) and granzyme B (GrB)-mediated apoptosis. There is considerable controversy regarding whether PRF is constitutively expressed, rapidly increased similar to a cytokine or delayed in its expression with more prolonged stimulation in virus-specific memory CD8+ T cells. Here the degree of cytotoxic capacity of virus-specific memory CD8+ T cells was directly proportional to the content of lytic molecules, which required antigenic stimulation over several days for maximal levels. This appeared to be modulated by increases in GrB transcription and microRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation of PRF expression. Clarifying the requirements for maximal cytotoxic capacity is critical to understanding how viral clearance might be mediated by memory cells and what functions should be induced by vaccines and immunotherapies.","['1 HIV-Specific Immunity Section, Laboratory of Immunoregulation, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD smigueles@nih.gov.', '2 HIV-Specific Immunity Section, Laboratory of Immunoregulation, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD.', '3 NIAID Collaborative Bioinformatics Resource (NCBR), Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Leidos Biomedical Research, Frederick, MD.', '4 Clinical Research Program Directorate, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Leidos Biomedical Research, Frederick, MD.', '5 Biostatistics Research Branch, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.']","Stephen A Migueles, Daniel C Rogan, Noah V Gavil, Elizabeth P Kelly, Sushila A Toulmin, Lawrence T Wang, Justin Lack, Addison J Ward, Patrick F Pryal, Amanda K Ludwig, Renata G Medina, Benjamin J Apple, Christina N Toumanios, April L Poole, Catherine A Rehm, Sara E Jones, C Jason Liang, Mark Connors, ",Journal of virology,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32907983
52,Overcoming Tumor Resistance to Oncolyticvaccinia Virus with Anti-PD-1-Based Combination Therapy by Inducing Antitumor Immunity in the Tumor Microenvironment,"The tumor microenvironment (TME) comprises different types of immune cells, which limit the therapeutic efficacy of most drugs. Although oncolytic virotherapy (OVT) boosts antitumor immunity via enhanced infiltration of tumor-infiltrated lymphocytes (TILs), immune checkpoints on the surface of tumors and TILs protect tumor cells from TIL recognition and apoptosis. OVT and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)-based combination therapy might overcome this issue. Therefore, combination immunotherapies to modify the immunosuppressive nature of TME and block immune checkpoints of immune cells and tumors are considered. In this study, cancer-favoring oncolytic vaccinia virus (CVV) and anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (anti-PD-1) were used to treat mouse colorectal cancer. Weekly-based intratumoral CVV and intraperitoneal anti-PD-1 injections were performed on Balb/c mice with subcutaneous CT26 tumors. Tumor volume, survival curve, and immunohistochemistry-based analysis demonstrated the benefit of co-treatment, especially simultaneous treatment with CVV and anti-PD-1. Infiltration of CD8+PD-1+ T-cells showed correlation with these results. Splenocytes enumeration also suggested CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell upregulation. In addition, upregulated CD8, PD-1, and CD86 messenger RNA expression was observed in this combination therapy. Therefore, CVV+anti-PD-1 combination therapy induces antitumor immunity in the TME, overcoming the rigidity and resistance of the TME in refractory cancers.","['1 BIO-IT Foundry Technology Institute, Pusan National University, Busan 46241, Korea.', '2 Research Institute for Convergence of Biomedical Science and Technology, Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital, Yangsan 50612, Korea.', '3 Biomedical Sciences, School of Medicine, Pusan National University, Yangsan 50612, Korea.', '4 Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, Pusan National University and Medical Research Institute, Pusan National University Hospital, Busan 49241, Korea.']","So Young Yoo, Narayanasamy Badrinath, Su-Nam Jeong, Hyun Young Woo, Jeong Heo, ",Vaccines,2020,immune checkpoints; immunotherapy; oncolytic virotherapy; tumor microenvironment; vaccinia virus.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32575351

Still, the identification of suitable antigens specific to the tumour that can be targets for cancer vaccines and T cell therapies is a challenge. Alternative processing of mRNA, a phenomenon that has been shown to alter the proteomic diversity of many cancers, may offer the potential of a broadened target space. Here, we discuss the promise of analysing mRNA processing events in cancer cells, with an emphasis on mRNA splicing, for the identification of potential new targets for cancer immunotherapy.

54,"WT1, PRAME, and PR3 mRNA Expression in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)","Several tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) were recently identified, that could qualify as targets for immunotherapy, they could qualify (on RNA-level) for monitoring of tumor load. Here, we studied the expression levels of the immunogenic antigens PRAME (preferentially expressed antigen of melanoma), WT1 (Wilms' tumor gene), and PR3 (proteinase 3) on myeloid blasts by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and correlated these data to the state and course of disease and to the defined subgroups of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). At first diagnoses, 41 of 47 patients tested showed overexpression of PRAME (87%), 38 of WT1 (81%), and 26 of PR3 (55%), with the highest expression levels for PRAME (2048-fold), followed by WT1 (486-fold) and PR3 (196-fold). Thereby, with 70%, the most frequent combination at first diagnoses was detected to be PRAME and WT1 (33/47 patients). Overall, 21 patients (45%) revealed overexpression for all 3 TAAs. Moreover, the highest expression levels of PRAME were found to be correlated with the FAB subtype M5, cytogenetic unfavorable risk groups, and AMLs arising from myelodysplasia (secondary AML; P=0.02). To compare TAA expression levels in the course of disease, expression data were calculatory adjusted to 100% blasts, revealing a relative increase in the PRAME expression levels during the course of persistent disease (3/4 cases). Independent of stage of disease, by trend, higher TAA expression levels were found on blasts derived from peripheral blood than those derived from the bone marrow. In conclusion, it is suggested that vaccine strategies for cancer immunotherapy should comprise different TAA peptides anticipating the diverse TAA expression levels on blasts evolving during the course of disease or treatment.","['1 Helmholtz Center Munich, German Research Center for Environmental Health.', '2 Med III, Department for Haematopoietic Transplantations, Großhadern Clinic, University of Munich, Munich, Germany.']","Brigitte Steger, Lajos Floro, Daniel C Amberger, Tanja Kroell, Johanna Tischer, Hans-Jochem Kolb, Helga Maria Schmetzer, ","Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)",Jul/Aug 2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32502139
55,DP7-C-modified liposomes enhance immune responses and the antitumor effect of a neoantigen-based mRNA vaccine,"To date, many clinical trials have been carried out with neoantigen-specific mRNA vaccines, and positive results have been achieved. However, further improvements in the efficiency of the intracellular delivery of mRNA and the production of a stronger immune response are still worth studying. In this study, we used the cholesterol-modified cationic peptide DP7 (VQWRIRVAVIRK), which was developed in our previous study, with a transmembrane structure and immunoadjuvant function to modify DOTAP liposomes to create a common mRNA delivery system. This system was intended to improve the efficiency of the delivery of mRNA encoding individualized neoantigens to dendritic cells (DCs) and enhance the activation of DCs. The system serves dual functions as a carrier and as an immunoadjuvant. As a carrier of mRNA, DP7-C-modified DOTAP liposomes (DOTAP/DP7-C) could transfer mRNA efficiently into different type of DCs in vitro. As an immunoadjuvant, DOTAP/DP7-C liposomes were shown to be more efficacious in stimulating DC maturation, CD103+ DC (contributing to antigen presentation) production and proinflammatory cytokine secretion than DOTAP liposomes both in vitro and in vivo. In animal studies, the subcutaneous administration of DOTAP/DP7-C/LL2 neoantigen-encoding mRNA complexes significantly inhibited the growth of LL2 in situ and the growth of subcutaneous tumors and stimulated the production of antigen-specific lymphocyte reactions, which were superior to the DOTAP/LL2 neoantigen-encoding mRNA complex group. In conclusion, DOTAP/DP7-C liposomes may serve as a potential universal mRNA delivery system, providing a simple method to increase the efficiency of intracellular mRNA delivery and the immunostimulatory activity of DCs.","['1 State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, and Collaborative Innovation Center for Biotherapy, Chengdu 610041, China.', ""2 Department of Pharmacy and Personalized Drug Therapy Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences & Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, Chengdu 610072, People's Republic of China."", '3 Precision Medicine Center, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, and Precision Medicine Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, West China Hospital, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center, Chengdu, China.', '4 State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, and Collaborative Innovation Center for Biotherapy, Chengdu 610041, China.

56,Natural Language Processing for the Identification of Surgical Site Infections in Orthopaedics,"Background:
      
    

    
      The identification of surgical site infections for infection surveillance in hospitals depends on the manual abstraction of medical records and, for research purposes, depends mainly on the use of administrative or claims data. The objective of this study was to determine whether automating the abstraction process with natural language processing (NLP)-based models that analyze the free-text notes of the medical record can identify surgical site infections with predictive abilities that match the manual abstraction process and that surpass surgical site infection identification from administrative data. Methods:
      
    

    
      We used surgical site infection surveillance data compiled by the infection prevention team to identify surgical site infections among patients undergoing orthopaedic surgical procedures at a tertiary care academic medical center from 2011 to 2017. We compiled a list of keywords suggestive of surgical site infections, and we used NLP to identify occurrences of these keywords and their grammatical variants in the free-text notes of the medical record. The key outcome was a binary indicator of whether a surgical site infection occurred. We estimated 7 incremental multivariable logistic regression models using a combination of administrative and NLP-derived variables. We split the analytic cohort into training (80%) and testing data sets (20%), and we used a tenfold cross-validation approach. The main analytic cohort included 172 surgical site infection cases and 200 controls that were repeatedly and randomly selected from a pool of 1,407 controls. Results:
      
    

    
      For Model 1 (variables from administrative data only), the sensitivity was 68% and the positive predictive value was 70%; for Model 4 (with NLP 5-grams [distinct sequences of 5 contiguous words] from the medical record), the sensitivity was 97% and the positive predictive value was 97%; and for Model 7 (a combination of Models 1 and 4), the sensitivity was 97% and the positive predictive value was 97%. Thus, NLP-based models identified 97% of surgical site infections identified by manual abstraction with high precision and 43% more surgical site infections compared with models that used administrative data only. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Models that used NLP keywords achieved predictive abilities that were comparable with the manual abstraction process and were superior to models that used administrative data only. NLP has the potential to automate and aid accurate surgical site infection identification and, thus, play an important role in their prevention. Clinical relevance:

57,Formulation and Delivery Technologies for mRNA Vaccines,"mRNA vaccines have become a versatile technology for the prevention of infectious diseases and the treatment of cancers. In the vaccination process, mRNA formulation and delivery strategies facilitate effective expression and presentation of antigens, and immune stimulation. mRNA vaccines have been delivered in various formats: encapsulation by delivery carriers, such as lipid nanoparticles, polymers, peptides, free mRNA in solution, and ex vivo through dendritic cells. Appropriate delivery materials and formulation methods often boost the vaccine efficacy which is also influenced by the selection of a proper administration route. Co-delivery of multiple mRNAs enables synergistic effects and further enhances immunity in some cases. In this chapter, we overview the recent progress and existing challenges in the formulation and delivery technologies of mRNA vaccines with perspectives for future development.","['1 Division of Pharmaceutics & Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, 43210, Columbus, OH, USA.', '2 Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, 43210, USA.', '3 Division of Pharmaceutics & Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, 43210, Columbus, OH, USA. dong.525@osu.edu.', '4 The Center for Clinical and Translational Science, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, 43210, USA. dong.525@osu.edu.', '5 The Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, 43210, USA. dong.525@osu.edu.', '6 Dorothy M.

58,A dataset to facilitate automated workflow analysis,"Data sets that provide a ground truth to quantify the efficacy of automated algorithms are rare due to the time consuming and expensive, although highly valuable, task of manually annotating observations. These datasets exist for niche problems in developed fields such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Business Process Mining (BPM), however it is difficult to find a suitable dataset for use cases that span across multiple fields, such as the one described in this study. The lack of established ground truth maps between cyberspace and the human-interpretable, persona-driven tasks that occur therein, is one of the principal barriers preventing reliable, automated situation awareness of dynamically evolving events and the consequences of loss due to cybersecurity breaches. Automated workflow analysis-the machine-learning assisted identification of templates of repeated tasks-is the likely missing link between semantic descriptions of mission goals and observable events in cyberspace. We summarize our efforts to establish a ground truth for an email dataset pertaining to the operation of an open source software project. The ground truth defines semantic labels for each email and the arrangement of emails within a sequence that describe actions observed in the dataset. Identified sequences are then used to define template workflows that describe the possible tasks undertaken for a project and their business process model. We present the overall purpose of the dataset, the methodology for establishing a ground truth, and lessons learned from the effort. Finally, we report on the proposed use of the dataset for the workflow discovery problem, and its effect on system accuracy.","['1 Defence Science & Technology Group, Edinburgh SA, Australia.', '2 MIT Lincoln Laboratory, Lexington MA, United States of America.']","Tony Allard, Paul Alvino, Leslie Shing, Allan Wollaber, Joseph Yuen, ",PloS one,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30730921
59,Poly(lactic acid) nanoparticles and cell-penetrating peptide potentiate mRNA-based vaccine expression in dendritic cells triggering their activation,"Messenger RNA-based vaccines have the potential to trigger robust cytotoxic immune responses, which are essential for fighting cancer and infectious diseases like HIV. Dendritic Cells (DCs) are choice targets for mRNA-based vaccine strategies, as they link innate and adaptive immune responses and are major regulators of cytotoxic and humoral adaptive responses. However, efficient delivery of antigen-coding mRNAs into DC cytosol has been highly challenging. In this study, we developed an alternative to lipid-based mRNA delivery systems, using poly(lactic acid) nanoparticles (PLA-NPs) and cationic cell-penetrating peptides as mRNA condensing agent. The formulations are assembled in two steps: (1) formation of a polyplex between mRNAs and amphipathic cationic peptides (RALA, LAH4 or LAH4-L1), and (2) adsorption of polyplexes onto PLA-NPs. LAH4-L1/mRNA polyplexes and PLA-NP/LAH4-L1/mRNA nanocomplexes are taken up by DCs via phagocytosis and clathrin-dependent endocytosis, and induce strong protein expression in DCs in vitro. They modulate DC innate immune response by activating both endosome and cytosolic Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs), and induce markers of adaptive responses in primary human DCs in vitro, with prevalent Th1 signature. Thus, LAH4-L1/mRNA and PLA-NP/LAH4-L1/mRNA represent a promising platform for ex vivo treatment and mRNA vaccine development.","[""1 Laboratoire de Biologie Tissulaire et d'Ingénierie Thérapeutique, UMR 5305, Université Lyon 1, CNRS, IBCP, Lyon, France."", ""2 Laboratoire de Biologie Tissulaire et d'Ingénierie Thérapeutique, UMR 5305, Université Lyon 1, CNRS, IBCP, Lyon, France.

      Palliative surgical procedures are frequently performed to reduce symptoms in patients with advanced cancer, but quality is difficult to measure. Objective:
      
    

    
      To determine whether natural language processing (NLP) of the electronic health record (EHR) can be used to (1) identify a population of cancer patients receiving palliative gastrostomy and (2) assess documentation of end-of-life process measures in the EHR. Design/setting:

Results:
      
    

    
      Among 302 cancer patients who underwent gastrostomy, 68 (22.5%) were classified by NLP as having a palliative indication for the procedure compared to 71 patients (23.5%) classified by human coders. Human chart abstraction took >2600 times longer than NLP (28 hours vs. 38 seconds). NLP identified the correct patients with 95.8% sensitivity and 97.4% specificity. NLP also identified end-of-life process measures with high sensitivity (85.7%-92.9%,) and specificity (96.7%-98.9%). In the two months leading up to palliative gastrostomy placement, 20.5% of patients had goals of care discussions documented. During the index hospitalization, 67.7% had goals of care discussions documented. Conclusions:

61,Development and validation of a pragmatic natural language processing approach to identifying falls in older adults in the emergency department,"Background:
      
    

    
      Falls among older adults are both a common reason for presentation to the emergency department, and a major source of morbidity and mortality. It is critical to identify fall patients quickly and reliably during, and immediately after, emergency department encounters in order to deliver appropriate care and referrals. Unfortunately, falls are difficult to identify without manual chart review, a time intensive process infeasible for many applications including surveillance and quality reporting. Here we describe a pragmatic NLP approach to automating fall identification. Methods:
      
    

    
      In this single center retrospective review, 500 emergency department provider notes from older adult patients (age 65 and older) were randomly selected for analysis. A simple, rules-based NLP algorithm for fall identification was developed and evaluated on a development set of 1084 notes, then compared with identification by consensus of trained abstractors blinded to NLP results. Results:

62,Accurate Identification of Colonoscopy Quality and Polyp Findings Using Natural Language Processing,"Objectives:
      
    

    
      The aim of this study was to test the ability of a commercially available natural language processing (NLP) tool to accurately extract examination quality-related and large polyp information from colonoscopy reports with varying report formats. Background:
      
    

    
      Colonoscopy quality reporting often requires manual data abstraction. NLP is another option for extracting information; however, limited data exist on its ability to accurately extract examination quality and polyp findings from unstructured text in colonoscopy reports with different reporting formats. Study design:
      
    

    
      NLP strategies were developed using 500 colonoscopy reports from Kaiser Permanente Northern California and then tested using 300 separate colonoscopy reports that underwent manual chart review. Using findings from manual review as the reference standard, we evaluated the NLP tool's sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and accuracy for identifying colonoscopy examination indication, cecal intubation, bowel preparation adequacy, and polyps ≥10 mm. Results:
      
    

    
      The NLP tool was highly accurate in identifying examination quality-related variables from colonoscopy reports. Compared with manual review, sensitivity for screening indication was 100% (95% confidence interval: 95.3%-100%), PPV was 90.6% (82.3%-95.8%), and accuracy was 98.2% (97.0%-99.4%). For cecal intubation, sensitivity was 99.6% (98.0%-100%), PPV was 100% (98.5%-100%), and accuracy was 99.8% (99.5%-100%). For bowel preparation adequacy, sensitivity was 100% (98.5%-100%), PPV was 100% (98.5%-100%), and accuracy was 100% (100%-100%). For polyp(s) ≥10 mm, sensitivity was 90.5% (69.6%-98.8%), PPV was 100% (82.4%-100%), and accuracy was 95.2% (88.8%-100%). Conclusion:

63,Natural language processing of symptoms documented in free-text narratives of electronic health records: a systematic review,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Natural language processing (NLP) of symptoms from electronic health records (EHRs) could contribute to the advancement of symptom science. We aim to synthesize the literature on the use of NLP to process or analyze symptom information documented in EHR free-text narratives. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      Our search of 1964 records from PubMed and EMBASE was narrowed to 27 eligible articles. Data related to the purpose, free-text corpus, patients, symptoms, NLP methodology, evaluation metrics, and quality indicators were extracted for each study. Results:
      
    

    
      Symptom-related information was presented as a primary outcome in 14 studies. EHR narratives represented various inpatient and outpatient clinical specialties, with general, cardiology, and mental health occurring most frequently. Studies encompassed a wide variety of symptoms, including shortness of breath, pain, nausea, dizziness, disturbed sleep, constipation, and depressed mood. NLP approaches included previously developed NLP tools, classification methods, and manually curated rule-based processing. Only one-third (n = 9) of studies reported patient demographic characteristics. Discussion:
      
    

    
      NLP is used to extract information from EHR free-text narratives written by a variety of healthcare providers on an expansive range of symptoms across diverse clinical specialties. The current focus of this field is on the development of methods to extract symptom information and the use of symptom information for disease classification tasks rather than the examination of symptoms themselves. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Future NLP studies should concentrate on the investigation of symptoms and symptom documentation in EHR free-text narratives. Efforts should be undertaken to examine patient characteristics and make symptom-related NLP algorithms or pipelines and vocabularies openly available.","['1 School of Nursing, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.', '2 School of Nursing, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.', '3 Data Science Institute, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.', '4 Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.', '5 Data Science Institute, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.']","Theresa A Koleck, Caitlin Dreisbach, Philip E Bourne, Suzanne Bakken, ",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2019,electronic health records; natural language processing; review; signs and symptoms.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30726935
64,Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing for Geolocation-Centric Monitoring and Characterization of Opioid-Related Social Media Chatter,"Importance:
      
    

    
      Automatic curation of consumer-generated, opioid-related social media big data may enable real-time monitoring of the opioid epidemic in the United States. Objective:
      
    

    
      To develop and validate an automatic text-processing pipeline for geospatial and temporal analysis of opioid-mentioning social media chatter. Design, setting, and participants:
      
    

    
      This cross-sectional, population-based study was conducted from December 1, 2017, to August 31, 2019, and used more than 3 years of publicly available social media posts on Twitter, dated from January 1, 2012, to October 31, 2015, that were geolocated in Pennsylvania. Opioid-mentioning tweets were extracted using prescription and illicit opioid names, including street names and misspellings. Social media posts (tweets) (n = 9006) were manually categorized into 4 classes, and training and evaluation of several machine learning algorithms were performed. Temporal and geospatial patterns were analyzed with the best-performing classifier on unlabeled data. Main outcomes and measures:
      
    

    
      Pearson and Spearman correlations of county- and substate-level abuse-indicating tweet rates with opioid overdose death rates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention WONDER database and with 4 metrics from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health for 3 years were calculated. Classifier performances were measured through microaveraged F1 scores (harmonic mean of precision and recall) or accuracies and 95% CIs. Results:
      
    

    
      A total of 9006 social media posts were annotated, of which 1748 (19.4%) were related to abuse, 2001 (22.2%) were related to information, 4830 (53.6%) were unrelated, and 427 (4.7%) were not in the English language. Yearly rates of abuse-indicating social media post showed statistically significant correlation with county-level opioid-related overdose death rates (n = 75) for 3 years (Pearson r = 0.451, P < .001; Spearman r = 0.331, P = .004). Abuse-indicating tweet rates showed consistent correlations with 4 NSDUH metrics (n = 13) associated with nonmedical prescription opioid use (Pearson r = 0.683, P = .01; Spearman r = 0.346, P = .25), illicit drug use (Pearson r = 0.850, P < .001; Spearman r = 0.341, P = .25), illicit drug dependence (Pearson r = 0.937, P < .001; Spearman r = 0.495, P = .09), and illicit drug dependence or abuse (Pearson r = 0.935, P < .001; Spearman r = 0.401, P = .17) over the same 3-year period, although the tests lacked power to demonstrate statistical significance. A classification approach involving an ensemble of classifiers produced the best performance in accuracy or microaveraged F1 score (0.726; 95% CI, 0.708-0.743). Conclusions and relevance:

65,Delivery of mRNA vaccines with heterocyclic lipids increases anti-tumor efficacy by STING-mediated immune cell activation,"Therapeutic messenger RNA vaccines enable delivery of whole antigens, which can be advantageous over peptide vaccines. However, optimal efficacy requires both intracellular delivery, to allow antigen translation, and appropriate immune activation. Here, we developed a combinatorial library of ionizable lipid-like materials to identify mRNA delivery vehicles that facilitate mRNA delivery in vivo and provide potent and specific immune activation. Using a three-dimensional multi-component reaction system, we synthesized and evaluated the vaccine potential of over 1,000 lipid formulations. The top candidate formulations induced a robust immune response, and were able to inhibit tumor growth and prolong survival in melanoma and human papillomavirus E7 in vivo tumor models. The top-performing lipids share a common structure: an unsaturated lipid tail, a dihydroimidazole linker and cyclic amine head groups. These formulations induce antigen-presenting cell maturation via the intracellular stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway, rather than through Toll-like receptors, and result in limited systemic cytokine expression and enhanced anti-tumor efficacy.","['1 David H.

66,Lipid core nanoparticles as a broad strategy to reverse fluconazole resistance in multiple Candida species,"Fungal resistance is the major problem related to fluconazole treatments. This study aims to develop innovative lipid core nanocapsules and nanostructured lipid carriers containing fluconazole, to study in vitro antifungal activity and to assess the possibility of resistance reversion in Candida albicans, C. glabrata, C. krusei, and C. tropicalis isolates. The action mechanism of nanoparticles was investigated through efflux pumps and scanning electron microscopy studies. The lipid core nanocapsules and nanostructured lipid carriers were prepared by interfacial deposition of preformed polymer and high-pressure homogenization methods, respectively. Both nanostructures presented sizes below 250 nm, SPAN < 1.6, negative zeta potential, pH slightly acid, high drug content and controlled drug release. The nanostructured lipid carriers were unable to reverse the fungal resistance. Lipid core nanoparticles displayed advantages such as a reduction in the effective dose of fluconazole and resistance reversion in all isolates tested - with multiple mechanisms of resistance. The main role of the supramolecular structure and the composition of the nanoparticles on antifungal mechanisms of action were discussed. The results achieved through this study have an impact on clinical therapy, with a potential application in the treatment of fungal infections caused by resistant isolates of Candida spp.","['1 Programa de Pós-Graduação em Farmacologia e Terapêutica, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Rua Sarmento Leite, 500, Centro, Porto Alegre, RS, 90050-170, Brazil.', '2 Programa de Pós-Graduação em Ciências Farmacêuticas, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Av Ipiranga, 2752, Santana, Porto Alegre, RS, 90610-000, Brazil.', '3 Programa de Pós-Graduação em Microbiologia Agrícola e do Ambiente, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Rua Sarmento Leite, 500, Centro, Porto Alegre, RS, 90050-170, Brazil.', '4 Programa de Pós-Graduação em Ciências Farmacêuticas, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Av Ipiranga, 2752, Santana, Porto Alegre, RS, 90610-000, Brazil; Departamento de Química Orgânica, Instituto de química, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, CP15003, Av.

67,Temporal analysis of mRNA expression profiles in Orientia infected C3HeB/FeJ mouse,"Background:
      
    

    
      Scrub typhus causes up to 35% mortality if left untreated. One billion people living in the endemic regions are at risk. In spite of its heavy disease burden in some of the most populated areas in the world, there is no vaccine available. Although the disease can be effectively treated by proper antibiotics, timely and accurate diagnosis remains a challenge. Orientia tsutsugamushi infects a variety of mammalian cells in vitro and replicates in the cytoplasm of the infected cells. Microarray analysis has been used extensively to study host-pathogen interactions in in vitro models to understand pathogenesis. However there is a lack of in vivo studies. Results:
      
    

    
      In this study, C3HeB/FeJ (C3H) mice were infected by O. tsutsugamushi via the intraperitoneal route and monitored gene expression at 10 different time points post infection. We observed two distinct types of expression profiles in the genes that we analyzed. There are two valleys (4-18 h and 2-4 days) with low number of differentially expressed genes (DEG) with three peaks with high number of DEG at 2 h, 1-day and 7-day post infection. Further analysis revealed that pathways like complement and coagulation cascade, and blood clotting cascade pathways showed significant global changes throughout entire time course. Real time quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) confirmed the change of expression for genes involved in complement and coagulation cascade. These results suggested dynamic regulation of the complement and coagulation cascades throughout most of the time post infection while some other specific pathways, such as fatty acid metabolism and tryptophan metabolism, are turned on or off at certain times post infection. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The findings highlight the complex interconnection among all different biological pathways. It is conceivable that specific pathways such as cell growth control and cell development in the host are affected by Orientia in the initial phase of infection for Orientia to grow intracellularly. Once Orientia is replicating successfully inside the host as infection progresses, the infection could activate pathways involved in cellular immune responses to defend for host cell survival and try to eliminate the pathogen.","['1 Viral and Rickettsial Diseases Department, Infectious Diseases Directorate, Naval Medical Research Center, 503 Robert Grant Ave, RM3N71, Silver Spring, MD, 20910, USA. chien-chung.chao.civ@mail.mil.', '2 Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD, USA. chien-chung.chao.civ@mail.mil.', '3 Integrative Systems Biology, US Army Medical Research and Material Command, USACEHR, Ft Detrick, Ft Federick, MD, USA.', '4 Advanced Biomedical Computation Science, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD, USA.', '5 Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD, USA.', '6 Viral and Rickettsial Diseases Department, Infectious Diseases Directorate, Naval Medical Research Center, 503 Robert Grant Ave, RM3N71, Silver Spring, MD, 20910, USA.']","Chien-Chung Chao, Ruoting Yang, Zhiwen Zhang, Tatyana Belinskaya, Chye-Teik Chan, Stacy-Ann Miller, Rasha Hammamieh, Marti Jett, Wei-Mei Ching, ",BMC microbiology,2020,Gene expression profiles; Orientia tsutsugamushi infection; Scrub typhus; Semi-quantitative PCR; cDNA microarray.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31906849

To identify the most crucial butyrate-regulated genes, we exploited whole genome microarray of HT-29 cells differentiated in vitro by butyrate treatment. Butyrate differentiates HT-29 cells by relaxing the perturbation, caused by mutations of Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and TP53 genes, the most frequent mutations observed in CRC. We constructed protein-protein interaction network (PPIN) with the differentially expressed genes after butyrate treatment and extracted the hub genes from the PPIN, which also participated in the APC-TP53 network. The idea behind this approach was that the expression of these hub genes also regulated cell differentiation, and subsequently CRC prognosis by evading the APC-TP53 mutational effect. We used mRNA expression profile of these critical hub genes from seven large CRC cohorts. Logistic Regression showed strong evidence for association of these common hubs with CRC recurrence. In this study, we exploited PPIN to reduce the dimension of microarray biologically and identified five prognostic markers for the CRC recurrence, which were validated across different datasets. Moreover, these five biomarkers we identified increase the predictive value of the TNM staging for CRC recurrence.","['1 a Tumor Initiation and Maintenance Program , Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute , La Jolla , California, USA.', '2 b Department of Clinical Medicine , National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases , Beliaghata , Kolkata, India.', '3 c Department of Immunology , University of Toronto , Toronto , Ontario, CANADA.', '4 d Division of Vaccine Discovery , La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology , La Jolla , California, USA.', '5 e Biomedical Informatics Centre, National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases , Beliaghata , Kolkata, India.']","Nirmalya Dasgupta, Bhupesh Kumar Thakur, Abhijit Chakraborty, Santasabuj Das, ",Nutrition and cancer,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30475060

73,Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cells Are a Preferred Source to Generate Dendritic Cells for Immunotherapy in Multiple Myeloma Patients,"In multiple myeloma (MM), dendritic cells (DCs), and their precursors are prone to malignant cell-mediated regulation of function leading to low efficacy of DC vaccine. DCs taken directly from MM patient's body or derived from monocytes are fewer in numbers and are also dysfunctional. Here, we investigated the functionality of Hematopoietic stem cell-derived DCs (SC-DCs) from MM patients. Mature-MM-SC-DCs showed all essential functions like antigen uptake, allogenic T cells simulation and migration comparable to those derived from healthy donor (HD) samples. A comparison of Mo-DCs and SC-DCs obtained from the same MM patients' samples revealed that the expression of IL-6 was higher in the precursors of Mo-DCs leading to their impaired migration. In addition, expression of CCR7 which is responsible for DCs migration was found to be lower in MM-Mo-DCs. The chromatin permissiveness as observed by H3K4me3 histone modification at the Ccr7 promoter in MM-Mo-DCs was significantly lower than those in MM-SC-DCs. Levels of Zbtb46- a hall mark DC transcription factor mRNA was also found to be reduced in MM-Mo-DCs. Cytotoxic T cells generated from MM-SC-DCs from autologous naïve T cells exhibited reduced antitumor activity because the T cells were exhausted. Blocking of CTLA-4 on autologous T cells could partially restore T cell proliferation and activation. Thus, a combination of MM-SC-DC vaccine and anti-CTLA-4 antibody may serve as a better candidate for immunotherapy of MM. This study has implications in increasing the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy in MM.","['1 National Centre for Cell Science, Savitribai Phule Pune University Campus, Pune, India.', '2 Blood and Marrow Transplant Unit, Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, Pune, India.']","Prajakta Shinde, Sameer Melinkeri, Manas Kumar Santra, Vaijayanti Kale, Lalita Limaye, ",Frontiers in immunology,2019,cytotoxic T cells; dendritic cell vaccine; monocytes; multiple myeloma; stem cells.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31164886

For a subset of patients, (formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded), tumor tissue samples were available for mRNA expression profiling and PD-L1 immunohistochemical staining. Results:
      
    

    
      Baseline characteristics were well balanced. One-year after randomization, 71% of patients in the study arm were alive and free of disease compared to 35% in the control arm. After a median follow-up of 53 months (range 3-67), 23 patients experienced a non-salvageable melanoma recurrence (TriMixDC-Mel arm n = 9 and control arm n = 14).The median time to non-salvageable recurrence was superior in the TriMixDC-MEL arm (median 8 months (range 1-6) vs. not reached; log-rank p 0.044). TriMixDC-MEL-related adverse events (AE) consisted of transient local skin reactions, flu-like symptoms and post-infusion chills. No grade ≥ 3 AE's occurred. The mRNA expression profiling revealed four genes (STAT2, TPSAB1, CD9 and CSF2) as potential predictive biomarkers. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      TriMixDC-MEL id/iv as adjuvant therapy is tolerable and may improve the 1-year disease-free survival rate. Combination of optimized autologous monocyte-derived DC-formulations warrants further investigation in combination with currently approved adjuvant therapy options.","['1 Department of Medical Oncology, Universitair Ziekenhuis Brussel (UZ Brussel), Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), Laarbeeklaan 103, 1090, Brussels, Belgium.

75,Deep learning in clinical natural language processing: a methodical review,"Objective:
      
    

    
      This article methodically reviews the literature on deep learning (DL) for natural language processing (NLP) in the clinical domain, providing quantitative analysis to answer 3 research questions concerning methods, scope, and context of current research. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, the Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library, and the Association for Computational Linguistics Anthology for articles using DL-based approaches to NLP problems in electronic health records. After screening 1,737 articles, we collected data on 25 variables across 212 papers. Results:
      
    

    
      DL in clinical NLP publications more than doubled each year, through 2018. Recurrent neural networks (60.8%) and word2vec embeddings (74.1%) were the most popular methods; the information extraction tasks of text classification, named entity recognition, and relation extraction were dominant (89.2%). However, there was a ""long tail"" of other methods and specific tasks. Most contributions were methodological variants or applications, but 20.8% were new methods of some kind. The earliest adopters were in the NLP community, but the medical informatics community was the most prolific. Discussion:
      
    

    
      Our analysis shows growing acceptance of deep learning as a baseline for NLP research, and of DL-based NLP in the medical community. A number of common associations were substantiated (eg, the preference of recurrent neural networks for sequence-labeling named entity recognition), while others were surprisingly nuanced (eg, the scarcity of French language clinical NLP with deep learning). Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Deep learning has not yet fully penetrated clinical NLP and is growing rapidly. This review highlighted both the popular and unique trends in this active field.","['1 School of Biomedical Informatics, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, Texas, USA.']","Stephen Wu, Kirk Roberts, Surabhi Datta, Jingcheng Du, Zongcheng Ji, Yuqi Si, Sarvesh Soni, Qiong Wang, Qiang Wei, Yang Xiang, Bo Zhao, Hua Xu, ",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2020,"deep learning; electronic health records; methodical, review, clinical text; natural language processing.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31794016
76,Difference in pathogenicity of 2 strains of avian leukosis virus subgroup J in broiler chicken,"Avian leukosis virus subgroup J has been found to infect many types of chickens with various genetic backgrounds. The ALV-J strain NX0101, which was isolated from broiler breeders in 2001, mainly induces the formation of myeloid cell tumors. However, strain HN10PY01, which was recently isolated from laying hens, mainly induces the formation of myeloid cell tumors and hemangioma. In order to determine the difference in pathogenicity of the 2 strains in broiler chickens, 2 groups of chicken embryos were infected with NA0101 and HN10PY01 separately. A comparison was made of the mortality, oncogenicity, body weights, indexes for immune organs, levels of ALV group-specific antigen p27, and mRNA expression levels of the tumor-related gene, p53, in ALV-J-infected birds and immune organs of theses chickens in response to Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) and avian influenza virus subtype H9 (AIV-H9) vaccination. The results indicated that strain NX0101 was highly pathogenic in broiler chickens and led to a 30% mortality rate and 45% oncogenicity, compared with the HN10PY01-infected birds. Weight of chickens was also significantly lower after 15 wk (P < 0.05). In addition, the mRNA expression levels of tumor-related p53 in medulla, liver, and lung in broilers infected with strain NX0101 were significantly higher than those infected with strain HN10PY01 (P < 0.05). These results indicated that strain NX0101 had a higher replication ability in broiler chickens. The findings of this study will contribute to further elucidating the mechanisms underlying host susceptibility and tumor classification in ALV-J-infected chickens.","['1 Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Biotechnology and Disease Control and Prevention, Shandong Agricultural University, 61 Daizong Street, Taian City, Shandong Province 271018, China.', '2 Shandong Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center of Animal Disease Control and Prevention, Shandong Agricultural University, 61 Daizong Street, Taian City, Shandong Province 271018, China.', '3 NHC Key Laboratory of Human Disease Comparative Medicine, Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS) & Comparative Medicine Centre, Peking Union Medical Collage (PUMC), Beijing 100021, China.', '4 The Biomedical Sciences Institute (Qingdao Branch of SJTU Bio-X Institutes), Qingdao University, Qingdao 266003, China.']","Guihua Zhang, Yajin Qu, Yujuan Niu, Huixia Zhang, Qinqin Sun, Xingpo Liu, Yue Li, Hui Zhang, Mengda Liu, ",Poultry science,2019,p53; avian leukosis virus subgroup J; growth retardation; pathogenicity.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30768138

78,Translation of the circular RNA circβ-catenin promotes liver cancer cell growth through activation of the Wnt pathway,"Background:
      
    

    
      Circular RNAs are a class of regulatory RNA transcripts, which are ubiquitously expressed in eukaryotes. In the current study, we evaluate the function of a novel circRNA derived from the β-catenin gene locus, circβ-catenin. Results:
      
    

    
      Circβ-catenin is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm and displays resistance to RNase-R treatment. We find that circβ-catenin is highly expressed in liver cancer tissues when compared to adjacent normal tissues. Silencing of circβ-catenin significantly suppresses malignant phenotypes in vitro and in vivo, and knockdown of this circRNA reduces the protein level of β-catenin without affecting its mRNA level. We show that circβ-catenin affects a wide spectrum of Wnt pathway-related genes, and furthermore, circβ-catenin produces a novel 370-amino acid β-catenin isoform that uses the start codon as the linear β-catenin mRNA transcript and translation is terminated at a new stop codon created by circularization. We find that this novel isoform can stabilize full-length β-catenin by antagonizing GSK3β-induced β-catenin phosphorylation and degradation, leading to activation of the Wnt pathway. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our findings illustrate a non-canonical function of circRNA in modulating liver cancer cell growth through the Wnt pathway, which can provide novel mechanistic insights into the underlying mechanisms of hepatocellular carcinoma.","[""1 Vaccine Research Institute, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""2 School of Biomedical Sciences, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong, People's Republic of China."", ""3 School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""4 The Nethersole School of Nursing, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong, People's Republic of China."", ""5 Vaccine Research Institute, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China. zhangjf06@gzucm.edu.cn."", ""6 School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, 511458, People's Republic of China. fuweiming76@smu.edu.cn."", ""7 Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of New Drug Screening, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, 510515, People's Republic of China. fuweiming76@smu.edu.cn."", ""8 Key Laboratory of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, The First Clinical Medical College, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China. keekee77@126.com."", ""9 Lingnan Medical Research Center, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, 510405, People's Republic of China. keekee77@126.com.""]","Wei-Cheng Liang, Cheuk-Wa Wong, Pu-Ping Liang, Mai Shi, Ye Cao, Shi-Tao Rao, Stephen Kwok-Wing Tsui, Mary Miu-Yee Waye, Qi Zhang, Wei-Ming Fu, Jin-Fang Zhang, ",Genome biology,2019,Cell growth; Circular RNA; Coding capacity; Non-coding RNA; Wnt pathway.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31027518
79,Natural language processing of German clinical colorectal cancer notes for guideline-based treatment evaluation,"Background:
      
    

    
      Colorectal cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer in Germany, and the second and third most commonly diagnosed cancer in women and men, respectively. The therapy for this disease is based primarily on the tumor stages, which are usually documented in an unstructured form in medical information systems. In order to re-use this knowledge, the information must be extracted and annotated using the correct terminology. Methods:
      
    

    
      In this study, a natural language processing pipeline is developed to identify specific guideline-based patient information and to annotate it with Unified Medical Language System concepts for manual evaluation by a physician. The gold standard for one-time evaluation is determined using the human abstraction of 2513 German clinical notes from electronic health records. Results:
      
    

    
      Using this approach to process the narrative clinical notes on colorectal cancer for retrospective evaluation of the therapy recommendation, the algorithm achieves a precision value of 96.64% for tumor stage detection and 97.95% for diagnosis recognition with recall values of 94.89% and 99.54%, respectively. The average precision value across all concepts relevant to treatment decisions for patients with known cancer diagnoses (11 concept groups) achieved a precision value of 82.05% with a recall value of 82.45% and an F1-score of 81.81%, respectively. Conclusions:

This data convergence has the potential to reveal new insights about cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, and response to treatment. Insights from this real-world data will catalyze clinical care, research, and regulatory activities. Natural language processing (NLP) methods are needed to extract these rich cancer phenotypes from clinical text. Here, we review the advances of NLP and information extraction methods relevant to oncology based on publications from PubMed as well as NLP and machine learning conference proceedings in the last 3 years.

81,Automating Ischemic Stroke Subtype Classification Using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing,"Objective:
      
    

    
      The manual adjudication of disease classification is time-consuming, error-prone, and limits scaling to large datasets. In ischemic stroke (IS), subtype classification is critical for management and outcome prediction. This study sought to use natural language processing of electronic health records (EHR) combined with machine learning methods to automate IS subtyping. Methods:
      
    

    
      Among IS patients from an observational registry with TOAST subtyping adjudicated by board-certified vascular neurologists, we analyzed unstructured text-based EHR data including neurology progress notes and neuroradiology reports using natural language processing. We performed several feature selection methods to reduce the high dimensionality of the features and 5-fold cross validation to test generalizability of our methods and minimize overfitting. We used several machine learning methods and calculated the kappa values for agreement between each machine learning approach to manual adjudication. We then performed a blinded testing of the best algorithm against a held-out subset of 50 cases. Results:
      
    

    
      Compared to manual classification, the best machine-based classification achieved a kappa of .25 using radiology reports alone, .57 using progress notes alone, and .57 using combined data. Kappa values varied by subtype being highest for cardioembolic (.64) and lowest for cryptogenic cases (.47). In the held-out test subset, machine-based classification agreed with rater classification in 40 of 50 cases (kappa .72). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Automated machine learning approaches using textual data from the EHR shows agreement with manual TOAST classification.

82,mRNA as a Transformative Technology for Vaccine Development to Control Infectious Diseases,"In the last two decades, there has been growing interest in mRNA-based technology for the development of prophylactic vaccines against infectious diseases. Technological advancements in RNA biology, chemistry, stability, and delivery systems have accelerated the development of fully synthetic mRNA vaccines. Potent, long-lasting, and safe immune responses observed in animal models, as well as encouraging data from early human clinical trials, make mRNA-based vaccination an attractive alternative to conventional vaccine approaches. Thanks to these data, together with the potential for generic, low-cost manufacturing processes and the completely synthetic nature, the prospects for mRNA vaccines are very promising. In addition, mRNA vaccines have the potential to streamline vaccine discovery and development, and facilitate a rapid response to emerging infectious diseases. In this review, we overview the unique attributes of mRNA vaccine approaches, review the data of mRNA vaccines against infectious diseases, discuss the current challenges, and highlight perspectives about the future of this promising technology.","['1 GSK, 14200 Shady Grove Road, Rockville, MD 20850, USA.

83,Development of an RNA Expression Platform Controlled by Viral Internal Ribosome Entry Sites,"Since 1990, many nucleic acid expression platforms consisting of DNA or RNA have been developed. However, although RNA expression platforms have been relatively neglected, several such platforms capped at the 5' end of RNA by an anti-reverse cap analog have now been developed. At the same time, the capping reaction is a bottleneck in the production of such platforms, with high cost and low efficiency. Here, we investigated several viral and eukaryotic internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) to develop an optimal RNA expression platform, because IRES-dependent translation does not require a capping step. RNA expression platforms constructed with IRESs from the 5' untranslated regions of the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and the intergenic region of the cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) showed sufficient expression efficiency compared with cap-dependent RNA expression platforms. However, eukaryotic IRESs exhibited a lower viral IRES expression efficiency. Interestingly, the addition of a poly(A) sequence to the 5' end of the coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) IRES (pMA-CVB3) increased the expression level compared with the CVB3 IRES without poly(A) (pCVB3). Therefore, we developed two multiexpression platforms (termed pMA-CVB3-EMCV and pCrPV-EMCV) by combining the IRESs of CVB3, CrPV, and EMCV in a single-RNA backbone. The pMA-CVB3-EMCV-derived RNA platform showed the highest expression level. Moreover, it clearly exhibited expression in mouse muscles in vivo. These RNA expression platforms prepared using viral IRESs will be useful in developing potential RNA-based prophylactic or therapeutic vaccines, because they have better expression efficiency and do not need a capping step.","['1 Department of Biotechnology, The Catholic University of Korea, Bucheon 14662, Republic of Korea.', '2 Department of Medical Nutrition, Graduate School of East-West Medical Science, Kyung Hee University, Yongin 17104, Republic of Korea.', '3 Cancer Imaging Center; Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul 08826, Republic of Korea.', '4 Department of Nuclear Medicine, Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 08826, Republic of Korea.']","Hae Li Ko, Hyo-Jung Park, Jihye Kim, Ha Kim, Hyewon Youn, Jae-Hwan Nam, ",Journal of microbiology and biotechnology,2019,Internal ribosome entry sites; RNA expression platform; coxsackievirus B3; cricket paralysis virus; encephalomyocarditis virus; poly(A).,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30518020

      Autologous dendritic cell (DC) vaccines can induce tumor-specific T cells, but their effect can be counteracted by immunosuppressive mechanisms. Cisplatin has shown immunomodulatory effects in vivo which may enhance efficacy of DC vaccination. Methods:
      
    

    
      This is a prospective, randomized, open-label phase 2 study (NCT02285413) including stage III and IV melanoma patients receiving 3 biweekly vaccinations of gp100 and tyrosinase mRNA-loaded monocyte-derived DCs with or without cisplatin. Primary objectives were to study immunogenicity and feasibility, and secondary objectives were to assess toxicity and survival. Results:
      
    

    
      Twenty-two stage III and 32 stage IV melanoma patients were analyzed. Antigen-specific CD8+ T cells were found in 44% versus 67% and functional T cell responses in 28% versus 19% of skin-test infiltrating lymphocytes in patients receiving DC vaccination with and without cisplatin, respectively. Four patients stopped cisplatin because of toxicity and continued DC monotherapy. No therapy-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred due to DC monotherapy. During combination therapy, one therapy-related grade 3 adverse event, decompensated heart failure due to fluid overload, occurred. The clinical outcome parameters did not clearly suggest significant differences. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Combination of DC vaccination and cisplatin in melanoma patients is feasible and safe, but does not seem to result in more tumor-specific T cell responses or improved clinical outcome, when compared to DC vaccination monotherapy.","['1 Department of Medical Oncology, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', '2 Department of Tumor Immunology, Radboud University Medical Center, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, PO Box 9101, 6500 HB, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', '3 Department of Pharmacy, Radboud University Medical center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', '4 Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', '5 School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Western Australia, Crawley, Australia.', '6 Department of Hematology, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', '7 Department of Pathology, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', '8 Department of Dermatology, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', '9 Department of Medical Oncology, Academic University Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', '10 Oncological Center, Rijnstate Hospital, Arnhem, The Netherlands.', '11 Department of Medical Oncology, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands. jolanda.devries@radboudumc.nl.', '12 Department of Tumor Immunology, Radboud University Medical Center, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, PO Box 9101, 6500 HB, Nijmegen, The Netherlands. jolanda.devries@radboudumc.nl.']","Steve Boudewijns, Martine Bloemendal, Nienke de Haas, Harm Westdorp, Kalijn F Bol, Gerty Schreibelt, Erik H J G Aarntzen, W Joost Lesterhuis, Mark A J Gorris, Alexandra Croockewit, Lieke L van der Woude, Michelle M van Rossum, Marieke Welzen, Anna de Goede, Stanleyson V Hato, Winette T A van der Graaf, Cornelis J A Punt, Rutger H T Koornstra, Winald R Gerritsen, Carl G Figdor, I Jolanda M de Vries, ","Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",2020 Mar,Cisplatin; Dendritic cell; Immunotherapy; Melanoma; Vaccination.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31980913
86,Natural Language Processing for Rapid Response to Emergent Diseases: Case Study of Calcium Channel Blockers and Hypertension in the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Background:
      
    

    
      A novel disease poses special challenges for informatics solutions. Biomedical informatics relies for the most part on structured data, which require a preexisting data or knowledge model; however, novel diseases do not have preexisting knowledge models. In an emergent epidemic, language processing can enable rapid conversion of unstructured text to a novel knowledge model. However, although this idea has often been suggested, no opportunity has arisen to actually test it in real time. The current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic presents such an opportunity. Objective:
      
    

    
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the added value of information from clinical text in response to emergent diseases using natural language processing (NLP). Methods:
      
    

    
      We explored the effects of long-term treatment by calcium channel blockers on the outcomes of COVID-19 infection in patients with high blood pressure during in-patient hospital stays using two sources of information: data available strictly from structured electronic health records (EHRs) and data available through structured EHRs and text mining. Results:
      
    

    
      In this multicenter study involving 39 hospitals, text mining increased the statistical power sufficiently to change a negative result for an adjusted hazard ratio to a positive one. Compared to the baseline structured data, the number of patients available for inclusion in the study increased by 2.95 times, the amount of available information on medications increased by 7.2 times, and the amount of additional phenotypic information increased by 11.9 times. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      In our study, use of calcium channel blockers was associated with decreased in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 infection. This finding was obtained by quickly adapting an NLP pipeline to the domain of the novel disease; the adapted pipeline still performed sufficiently to extract useful information. When that information was used to supplement existing structured data, the sample size could be increased sufficiently to see treatment effects that were not previously statistically detectable.","['1 Department of Biomedical Informatics, Necker-Enfant Malades Hospital, Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris, France.', '2 Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, INSERM UMRS 1138 Team 22, Université de Paris, Paris, France.', '3 LIMSI, CNRS, Université Paris Saclay, Orsay, France.', '4 Department of Biomedical Informatics, Georges Pompidou European Hospital, Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris, France.', '5 DSI WIND, Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris, France.', '6 School of Medicine, University of Colorado, Denver, CO, United States.', '7 Institut Imagine, INSERM U1163, Université Paris Descartes, Université de Paris, Paris, France.']","Antoine Neuraz, Ivan Lerner, William Digan, Nicolas Paris, Rosy Tsopra, Alice Rogier, David Baudoin, Kevin Bretonnel Cohen, Anita Burgun, Nicolas Garcelon, Bastien Rance, AP-HP/Universities/INSERM COVID-19 Research Collaboration; AP-HP COVID CDR Initiative, ",Journal of medical Internet research,2020,COVID-19; electronic health records; emergent disease; informatics; medication information; natural language processing; public health; response.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32759101

      A software pipeline preprocessed Reddit comments from 2005 to 2017 from 7 popular dermatology-related subforums on Reddit, applied latent Dirichlet allocation, and used spectral clustering to establish cohesive themes and the frequency of word representation and grouped terms within these topics. Results:
      
    

    
      We created a corpus of 176,000 comments and identified trends in patient engagement in spaces such as eczema and acne, among others, with a focus on homeopathic treatments and isotretinoin. Limitations:
      
    

    
      Latent Dirichlet allocation is an unsupervised model, meaning there is no ground truth to which the model output can be compared. However, because these forums are anonymous, there seems little incentive for patients to be dishonest. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Reddit data has viability and utility for dermatologic research and engagement with the public, especially for common dermatology topics such as tanning, acne, and psoriasis.","['1 School of Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', '2 Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', '3 Department of Dermatology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

88,Identifying Suicidal Adolescents from Mental Health Records Using Natural Language Processing,"Suicidal ideation is a risk factor for self-harm, completed suicide and can be indicative of mental health issues. Adolescents are a particularly vulnerable group, but few studies have examined suicidal behaviour prevalence in large cohorts. Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are a rich source of secondary health care data that could be used to estimate prevalence. Most EHR documentation related to suicide risk is written in free text, thus requiring Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches. We adapted and evaluated a simple lexicon- and rule-based NLP approach to identify suicidal adolescents from a large EHR database. We developed a comprehensive manually annotated EHR reference standard and assessed NLP performance at both document and patient level on data from 200 patients ( 5000 documents). We achieved promising results (>80% f1 score at both document and patient level). Simple NLP approaches can be successfully used to identify patients who exhibit suicidal risk behaviour, and our proposed approach could be useful for other populations and settings.","[""1 Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK."", '2 School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, KTH, Stockholm, Sweden.', '3 South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.']","Sumithra Velupillai, Sophie Epstein, André Bittar, Thomas Stephenson, Rina Dutta, Johnny Downs, ",Studies in health technology and informatics,2019,Electronic Health Records; Natural Language Processing; Suicide.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31437956
89,Advanced diagnostic imaging utilization during emergency department visits in the United States: A predictive modeling study for emergency department triage,"Background:
      
    

    
      Emergency department (ED) crowding is associated with negative health outcomes, patient dissatisfaction, and longer length of stay (LOS). The addition of advanced diagnostic imaging (ADI), namely CT, ultrasound (U/S), and MRI to ED encounter work up is a predictor of longer length of stay. Earlier and improved prediction of patients' need for advanced imaging may improve overall ED efficiency. The aim of the study was to detect the association between ADI utilization and the structured and unstructured information immediately available during ED triage, and to develop and validate models to predict utilization of ADI during an ED encounter. Methods:
      
    

    
      We used the United States National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey data from 2009 to 2014 to examine which sociodemographic and clinical factors immediately available at ED triage were associated with the utilization of CT, U/S, MRI, and multiple ADI during a patient's ED stay. We used natural language processing (NLP) topic modeling to incorporate free-text reason for visit data available at time of ED triage in addition to other structured patient data to predict the use of ADI using multivariable logistic regression models. Results:
      
    

    
      Among the 139,150 adult ED visits from a national probability sample of hospitals across the U.S, 21.9% resulted in ADI use, including 16.8% who had a CT, 3.6% who had an ultrasound, 0.4% who had an MRI, and 1.2% of the population who had multiple types of ADI. The c-statistic of the predictive models was greater than or equal to 0.78 for all imaging outcomes, and the addition of text-based reason for visit information improved the accuracy of all predictive models. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Patient information immediately available during ED triage can accurately predict the eventual use of advanced diagnostic imaging during an ED visit. Such models have the potential to be incorporated into the ED triage workflow in order to more rapidly identify patients who may require advanced imaging during their ED stay and assist with medical decision-making.","['1 University of Michigan School of Nursing, Applied Biostatics Laboratory, Ann Arbor, MI, United States of America.', '2 Department of Surgery, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, United States of America.', '3 Department of Internal Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, United States of America.', '4 Department of Epidemiology, Rollins School of Public Health, Atlanta, GA, United States of America.', '5 Health Services Research Center, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, United States of America.', '6 Department of Emergency Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, United States of America.', '7 Department of Radiology & Imaging Sciences, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, United States of America.', '8 Department of Biomedical Informatics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, United States of America.']","Xingyu Zhang, Joyce Kim, Rachel E Patzer, Stephen R Pitts, Falgun H Chokshi, Justin D Schrager, ",PloS one,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30964899
90,Natural Language Processing of Clinical Notes for Improved Early Prediction of Septic Shock in the ICU,"Sepsis and septic shock are major concerns in public health as the leading contributors to hospital mortality and cost of treatment in the United States. Early treatment is instrumental for improving patient outcome; to this end, algorithmic methods for early prediction of septic shock have been developed using electronic health record data, with the goal of decreasing treatment delay. We extend a previously-developed method, using a gradient boosting algorithm (XG-Boost) to compute a time-evolving risk of impending transition into septic shock, by combining physiological data from the electronic health record with features obtained from natural language processing of clinical note data. We compare two different methods for generating natural language processing features, with the best method obtaining improved performance of 0.92 AUC, 84% sensitivity, 82% specificity, 49% positive predictive value, and a median early warning time of 7.0 hours. This degree of early warning is sufficient to enable intervention many hours in advance of septic shock onset, with the improved prediction performance of this method resulting in fewer false alarms and thus more actionable predictions.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Ran Liu, Joseph L Greenstein, Sridevi V Sarma, Raimond L Winslow, ",Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

91,Transcutaneous delivery of DNA/mRNA for cancer therapeutic vaccination,"Therapeutic vaccination is a promising strategy for the immunotherapy of cancers. It eradicates cancer cells by evoking and strengthening the patient's own immune system. Because of the easy access and sophisticated immune networks, the skin becomes an ideal target organ for vaccination. Genetic vaccines have been widely investigated, with the advantages of the delivery of multiple antigens and a lower cost for production compared to protein/peptide vaccines. This review summarizes the advances made with respect to the transcutaneous delivery of DNA/mRNA for cancer therapeutic vaccination and also gives a brief description of the immunological milieu of the skin and the importance of dendritic cell-targeting in vaccine delivery, as well as the technologies that aim to facilitate antigen delivery and modulate antigen-presenting cells, thus improving cellular responses. The applications of genetic vaccines encoding tumor antigens delivered through the skin route, both in preclinical and clinical trials, are outlined.","['1 School of Medicine, Zhejiang University City College, Hangzhou, China.', '2 State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.']","Xiaoyi Sun, Linghui Zeng, Yongzhuo Huang, ",The journal of gene medicine,2019 Jul,DNA; cancer immunotherapy; mRNA; transcutaneous delivery; transcutaneous immunization; vaccine.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30958606
92,A systematic review of natural language processing for classification tasks in the field of incident reporting and adverse event analysis,"Context:
      
    

    
      Adverse events in healthcare are often collated in incident reports which contain unstructured free text. Learning from these events may improve patient safety. Natural language processing (NLP) uses computational techniques to interrogate free text, reducing the human workload associated with its analysis. There is growing interest in applying NLP to patient safety, but the evidence in the field has not been summarised and evaluated to date. Objective:
      
    

    
      To perform a systematic literature review and narrative synthesis to describe and evaluate NLP methods for classification of incident reports and adverse events in healthcare. Methods:
      
    

    
      Data sources included Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, CINAHL, MIDIRS, ISI Web of Science, SciELO, Google Scholar, PROSPERO, hand searching of key articles, and OpenGrey. Data items were manually abstracted to a standardised extraction form. Results:
      
    

    
      From 428 articles screened for eligibility, 35 met the inclusion criteria of using NLP to perform a classification task on incident reports, or with the aim of detecting adverse events. The majority of studies used free text from incident reporting systems or electronic health records. Models were typically designed to classify by type of incident, type of medication error, or harm severity. A broad range of NLP techniques are demonstrated to perform these classification tasks with favourable performance outcomes. There are methodological challenges in how these results can be interpreted in a broader context. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      NLP can generate meaningful information from unstructured data in the specific domain of the classification of incident reports and adverse events. Understanding what or why incidents are occurring is important in adverse event analysis. If NLP enables these insights to be drawn from larger datasets it may improve the learning from adverse events in healthcare.","['1 Department of Anaesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine, Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, 51 Little France Crescent, Edinburgh, Scotland, EH16 4SA, United Kingdom.

93,"Enzymatic Protein Biopolymers as a Tool to Synthetize Eukaryotic Messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) with Uses in Vaccination, Immunotherapy and Nanotechnology","Multi-subunit enzymes are protein biopolymers that are involved in many cellular processes. The enzyme that carries out the process of transcription of mRNAs is RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), which is a multi-subunit enzyme in eukaryotes. This protein biopolymer starts the transcription from specific sites and is positioned by transcription factors, which form a preinitiation complex (PIC) on gene promoters. To recognize and position the RNAPII and the transcription factors on the gene promoters are needed specific DNA sequences in the gene promoters, which are named promoter elements. Those gene promoter elements can vary and therefore several kinds of promoters exist, however, it appears that all promoters can use a similar pathway for PIC formation. Those pathways are discussed in this review. The in vitro transcribed mRNA can be used as vaccines to fight infectious diseases, e.g., in immunotherapy against cancer and in nanotechnology to deliver mRNA for a missing protein into the cell. We have outlined a procedure to produce an mRNA vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is the causing agent of the big pandemic, COVID-19, affecting human beings all over the world. The potential advantages of using eukaryotic RNAPII to synthetize large transcripts are outlined and discussed. In addition, we suggest a method to cap the mRNA at the 5' terminus by using enzymes, which might be more effective than cap analogs. Finally, we suggest the construction of a future multi-talented RNAPII, which would be able to synthetize large mRNA and cap them in the test tube.","['1 Programa de Biología Celular y Molecular, Instituto de Ciencias Biomédicas, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Chile, Independencia 1027, Santiago 8380453, Chile.', '2 Laboratorio de Genética Molecular Humana, Programa de Genética Humana, Instituto de Ciencias Biomédicas, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Chile, Independencia 1027, Santiago 8380453, Chile.']","Fabiola Urbina, Sebastián Morales-Pison, Edio Maldonado, ",Polymers,2020,immunotherapy; mRNA; nanotechnology; protein biopolymer; transcription; vaccine.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32717794
94,Research Domain Criteria scores estimated through natural language processing are associated with risk for suicide and accidental death,"Background:
      
    

    
      Identification of individuals at increased risk for suicide is an important public health priority, but the extent to which considering clinical phenomenology improves prediction of longer term outcomes remains understudied. Hospital discharge provides an opportunity to stratify risk using readily available clinical records and details. Methods:
      
    

    
      We applied a validated natural language processing tool to generate estimated Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) scores for a cohort of 444,317 individuals drawn from 815,457 hospital discharges between 2005 and 2013. We used survival analysis to examine the association of this risk with suicide and accidental death, adjusted for sociodemographic features. Results:
      
    

    
      In adjusted models, symptoms in each of the five domains contributed to incremental risk (log rank P < 0.001), with greatest increase observed with positive valence. The contribution of each domain to risk was time dependent. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      RDoC symptom scores parsed from clinical documentation are associated with suicide and illustrates that multiple domains contribute to risk in a time-varying fashion.","['1 Center for Quantitative Health, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', '2 Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', '3 Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.']","Thomas H McCoy Jr, Amelia M Pellegrini, Roy H Perlis, ",Depression and anxiety,2019 May,Research Domain Criteria; accidental death; electronic health records; natural language processing; suicide; survival analysis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30710497
95,A systematic review of natural language processing and text mining of symptoms from electronic patient-authored text data,"Objective:
      
    

    
      In this systematic review, we aim to synthesize the literature on the use of natural language processing (NLP) and text mining as they apply to symptom extraction and processing in electronic patient-authored text (ePAT). Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      A comprehensive literature search of 1964 articles from PubMed and EMBASE was narrowed to 21 eligible articles. Data related to purpose, text source, number of users and/or posts, evaluation metrics, and quality indicators were recorded. Results:
      
    

    
      Pain (n = 18) and fatigue and sleep disturbance (n = 18) were the most frequently evaluated symptom clinical content categories. Studies accessed ePAT from sources such as Twitter and online community forums or patient portals focused on diseases, including diabetes, cancer, and depression. Fifteen studies used NLP as a primary methodology. Studies reported evaluation metrics including the precision, recall, and F-measure for symptom-specific research questions. Discussion:
      
    

    
      NLP and text mining have been used to extract and analyze patient-authored symptom data in a wide variety of online communities. Though there are computational challenges with accessing ePAT, the depth of information provided directly from patients offers new horizons for precision medicine, characterization of sub-clinical symptoms, and the creation of personal health libraries as outlined by the National Library of Medicine. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Future research should consider the needs of patients expressed through ePAT and its relevance to symptom science. Understanding the role that ePAT plays in health communication and real-time assessment of symptoms, through the use of NLP and text mining, is critical to a patient-centered health system.","['1 University of Virginia, School of Nursing, Charlottesville, VA, USA; University of Virginia, Data Science Institute, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', '2 Columbia University, School of Nursing, New York, NY, USA.', '3 University of Virginia, Data Science Institute, Charlottesville, VA, USA; University of Virginia, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', '4 Columbia University, School of Nursing, New York, NY, USA; Columbia University, Department of Biomedical Informatics, New York, NY, USA; Columbia University, Data Science Institute, New York, NY, USA.

96,GIDB: a knowledge database for the automated curation and multidimensional analysis of molecular signatures in gastrointestinal cancer,"Gastrointestinal (GI) cancer is common, characterized by high mortality, and includes oesophagus, gastric, liver, bile duct, pancreas, rectal and colon cancers. The insufficient specificity and sensitivity of biomarkers is still a key clinical hindrance for GI cancer diagnosis and successful treatment. The emergence of `precision medicine', `basket trial' and `field cancerization' concepts calls for an urgent need and importance for the understanding of how organ system cancers occur at the molecular levels. Knowledge from both the literature and data available in public databases is informative in elucidating the molecular alterations underlying GI cancer. Currently, most available cancer databases have not offered a comprehensive discovery of gene-disease associations, molecular alterations and clinical information by integrated text mining and data mining in GI cancer. We develop GIDB, a panoptic knowledge database that attempts to automate the curation of molecular signatures using natural language processing approaches and multidimensional analyses. GIDB covers information on 8730 genes with both literature and data supporting evidence, 248 miRNAs, 58 lncRNAs, 320 copy number variations, 49 fusion genes and 2381 semantic networks. It presents a comprehensive database, not only in parallelizing supporting evidence and data integration for signatures associated with GI cancer but also in providing the timeline feature of major molecular discoveries. It highlights the most comprehensive overview, research hotspots and the development of historical knowledge of genes in GI cancer. Furthermore, GIDB characterizes genomic abnormalities in multilevel analysis, including simple somatic mutations, gene expression, DNA methylation and prognosis. GIDB offers a user-friendly interface and two customizable online tools (Heatmap and Network) for experimental researchers and clinicians to explore data and help them shorten the learning curve and broaden the scope of knowledge. More importantly, GIDB is an ongoing research project that will continue to be updated and improve the automated method for reducing manual work.","['1 Research Center for Translational Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, School of Life Sciences and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China.', '2 Department of Laboratory Medicine, Shanghai Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital, Shanghai, China.']","Ying Wang, Yueqian Wang, Shuangkuai Wang, Yuantao Tong, Ling Jin, Hui Zong, Rongbin Zheng, Jinxuan Yang, Zeyu Zhang, En Ouyang, Mengyan Zhou, Xiaoyan Zhang, ",Database : the journal of biological databases and curation,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31089686
97,Nanoscale platforms for messenger RNA delivery,"Messenger RNA (mRNA) has become a promising class of drugs for diverse therapeutic applications in the past few years. A series of clinical trials are ongoing or will be initiated in the near future for the treatment of a variety of diseases. Currently, mRNA-based therapeutics mainly focuses on ex vivo transfection and local administration in clinical studies. Efficient and safe delivery of therapeutically relevant mRNAs remains one of the major challenges for their broad applications in humans. Thus, effective delivery systems are urgently needed to overcome this limitation. In recent years, numerous nanoscale biomaterials have been constructed for mRNA delivery in order to protect mRNA from extracellular degradation and facilitate endosomal escape after cellular uptake. Nanoscale platforms have expanded the feasibility of mRNA-based therapeutics, and enabled its potential applications to protein replacement therapy, cancer immunotherapy, therapeutic vaccines, regenerative medicine, and genome editing. This review focuses on recent advances, challenges, and future directions in nanoscale platforms designed for mRNA delivery, including lipid and lipid-derived nanoparticles, polymer-based nanoparticles, protein derivatives mRNA complexes, and other types of nanomaterials.

There are no antiviral drugs with proven clinical efficacy for the treatment of COVID-19, nor are there any vaccines that prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2, and efforts to develop drugs and vaccines are hampered by the limited knowledge of the molecular details of how SARS-CoV-2 infects cells. Here we cloned, tagged and expressed 26 of the 29 SARS-CoV-2 proteins in human cells and identified the human proteins that physically associated with each of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins using affinity-purification mass spectrometry, identifying 332 high-confidence protein-protein interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and human proteins. Among these, we identify 66 druggable human proteins or host factors targeted by 69 compounds (of which, 29 drugs are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, 12 are in clinical trials and 28 are preclinical compounds). We screened a subset of these in multiple viral assays and found two sets of pharmacological agents that displayed antiviral activity: inhibitors of mRNA translation and predicted regulators of the sigma-1 and sigma-2 receptors. Further studies of these host-factor-targeting agents, including their combination with drugs that directly target viral enzymes, could lead to a therapeutic regimen to treat COVID-19.","['1 QBI COVID-19 Research Group (QCRG), San Francisco, CA, USA.', '2 Quantitative Biosciences Institute (QBI), University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', '3 J.

99,Transient redirection of T cells for adoptive cell therapy with telomerase-specific T helper cell receptors isolated from long term survivors after cancer vaccination,"Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) with retargeted T cells has produced remarkable clinical responses against cancer, but also serious toxicity. Telomerase is overexpressed in most cancers, but also expressed in some normal cells, raising safety concerns. We hypothesize that ACT with T-helper cell receptors may overcome tumour tolerance, mobilize host immune cells and induce epitope spreading, with limited toxicity. From long term survivors after cancer vaccination, we have isolated telomerase-specific T cell receptors (TCRs) from T-helper cells. Herein, we report the development of transient retargeting of T cells with mRNA-based TCRs. This strategy allows for safer clinical testing and meaningful dose escalation. DP4 is the most common HLA molecule. We cloned two telomerase-specific, DP4-restricted TCRs into the mRNA expression vector pCIpA102, together with the sorter/marker/suicide gene RQR8. Donor T cells were electroporated with mRNA encoding TCR_RQR8. The results showed that both TCR_RQR8 constructs were expressed in >90% of T cells. The transfected T cells specifically recognized the relevant peptide, as well as naturally processed epitopes from a 177aa telomerase protein fragment, and remained functional for six days. A polyfunctional and Th1-like cytokine profile was observed. The TCRs were functional in both CD4+and CD8+recipient T cells, even though DP4-restricted. The findings demonstrate that the cloned TCRs confer recipient T cells with the desired telomerase-specificity and functionality. Preclinical experiments may provide limited information on the efficacy and toxicity of T-helper TCRs, as these mobilize the host immune system. We therefore intend to use the mRNA-based TCRs for a first-in-man trial.","['1 Department of Oncology, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', '2 Section for Cancer Immunology, Cancer Research Institute, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', '3 Department of Haematology, Cancer Institute, University College London, London, UK.']","Jon Amund Kyte, Anne Fåne, Martin Pule, Gustav Gaudernack, ",Oncoimmunology,2019,DP4; T cell receptor; T-helper cell; adoptive cell therapy; cancer; immunotherapy; long-term survivor; mRNA; retargeted T cell; telomerase.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30906659
100,Clinical Data Extraction and Normalization of Cyrillic Electronic Health Records Via Deep-Learning Natural Language Processing,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      A substantial portion of medical data is unstructured. Extracting data from unstructured text presents a barrier to advancing clinical research and improving patient care. In addition, ongoing studies have been focused predominately on the English language, whereas inflected languages with non-Latin alphabets (such as Slavic languages with a Cyrillic alphabet) present numerous linguistic challenges. We developed deep-learning-based natural language processing algorithms for automatically extracting biomarker status of patients with breast cancer from three oncology centers in Bulgaria. Methods:
      
    

    
      We used dual embeddings for English and Bulgarian languages, encoding both syntactic and polarity information for the words. The embeddings were subsequently aligned so that they were in the same vector space. The embeddings were used as input to convolutional or recurrent neural networks to derive the biomarker status of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. Results:
      
    

    
      We showed that we can resolve ambiguity in highly variable medical text containing both Latin and Cyrillic text. Final models incorporating both English and Bulgarian syntax and polarity embeddings achieved F1 scores of 0.90 or higher for all estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 biomarkers. The models were robust against human errors originally found in the training set. In addition, such models can be extended for analyzing text containing words not seen during training. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      By using several techniques that incorporate dual-word embeddings encoding syntactic and polarity information in two languages followed by deep neural network architectures, we show that researchers can extract and normalize parameters within medical data. The principles described here can be used to analyze Cyrillic or Latin mixed medical text and extract other parameters.","['1 Sqilline Health, Boston, MA.']","Boyang Zhao, ",JCO clinical cancer informatics,2019 Sep,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31577448

Meanwhile, descriptions of rare conditions are missing from online educational resources. SNOMEDtxt converts ontological concept definitions and relations contained in SNOMED CT into narrative disease descriptions using Natural Language Generation techniques. Generated text is evaluated using both computational methods and clinician and lay user feedback. User evaluations indicate that lay people prefer generated text to the original SNOMED content, find it more informative, and understand it significantly better. This method promises to improve access to clinical knowledge for patients and the medical community and to assist in ontology auditing through natural language descriptions.","['1 Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.']","Olga Lyudovyk, Chunhua Weng, ",Studies in health technology and informatics,2019,Access to Information; Natural Language Processing; Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31438128

      To develop classification algorithms that accurately identify axial SpA (axSpA) patients in electronic health records, and compare the performance of algorithms incorporating free-text data against approaches using only International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes. Methods:
      
    

    
      An enriched cohort of 7853 eligible patients was created from electronic health records of two large hospitals using automated searches (⩾1 ICD codes combined with simple text searches). Key disease concepts from free-text data were extracted using NLP and combined with ICD codes to develop algorithms. We created both supervised regression-based algorithms-on a training set of 127 axSpA cases and 423 non-cases-and unsupervised algorithms to identify patients with high probability of having axSpA from the enriched cohort. Their performance was compared against classifications using ICD codes only. Results:
      
    

    
      NLP extracted four disease concepts of high predictive value: ankylosing spondylitis, sacroiliitis, HLA-B27 and spondylitis. The unsupervised algorithm, incorporating both the NLP concept and ICD code for AS, identified the greatest number of patients. By setting the probability threshold to attain 80% positive predictive value, it identified 1509 axSpA patients (mean age 53 years, 71% male). Sensitivity was 0.78, specificity 0.94 and area under the curve 0.93. The two supervised algorithms performed similarly but identified fewer patients. All three outperformed traditional approaches using ICD codes alone (area under the curve 0.80-0.87). Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Algorithms incorporating free-text data can accurately identify axSpA patients in electronic health records. Large cohorts identified using these novel methods offer exciting opportunities for future clinical research.","['1 Institute of Ageing and Chronic Disease, University of Liverpool.', '2 Department of Academic Rheumatology, Aintree University Hospital, Liverpool, UK.', ""3 Division of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy, Brigham and Women's Hospital."", '4 Harvard Medical School.', ""5 Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Brigham and Women's Hospital."", '6 Harvard T.H.

Telehealth networks implement closed-loop healthcare paradigms for optimal treatment of the patients. For comprehensive documentation of medication treatment, health professionals create free text collaboration notes in addition to structured information. To make this valuable source of information available for adherence analyses, we developed classifiers for automated categorization of notes based on natural language processing, which allows filtering of relevant entries to spare data analysts from tedious manual screening. Furthermore, we identified potential improvements of the queries for structured treatment documentation. For 3,952 notes, the majority of the manually annotated category tags was medication-related. The highest F1-measure of our developed classifiers was 0.90. We conclude that our approach is a valuable tool to support adherence research based on datasets containing free-text entries.","['1 AIT Austrian Institute of Technology GmbH, Graz, Austria.', '2 Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria.', '3 Landesinstitut für Integrierte Versorgung - LIV Tirol, Innsbruck, Austria.', '4 Department of Internal Medicine III, Cardiology and Angiology, Medical University Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.']","Alphons Eggerth, Karl Kreiner, Dieter Hayn, Bernhard Pfeifer, Gerhard Pölzl, Tim Egelseer-Bründl, Günter Schreier, ",Studies in health technology and informatics,2020,Adherence; heart failure; machine learning; telemedicine; text mining.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32570485

107,The implementation of natural language processing to extract index lesions from breast magnetic resonance imaging reports,"Background:
      
    

    
      There are often multiple lesions in breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reports and radiologists usually focus on describing the index lesion that is most crucial to clinicians in determining the management and prognosis of patients. Natural language processing (NLP) has been used for information extraction from mammography reports. However, few studies have investigated NLP in breast MRI data based on free-form text. The objective of the current study was to assess the validity of our NLP program to accurately extract index lesions and their corresponding imaging features from free-form text of breast MRI reports. Methods:
      
    

    
      This cross-sectional study examined 1633 free-form text reports of breast MRIs from 2014 to 2017. First, the NLP system was used to extract 9 features from all the lesions in the reports according to the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) descriptors. Second, the index lesion was defined as the lesion with the largest number of imaging features. Third, we extracted the values of each imaging feature and the BI-RADS category from each index lesion. To evaluate the accuracy of our system, 478 reports were manually reviewed by two individuals. The time taken to extract data by NLP was compared with that by reviewers. Results:
      
    

    
      The NLP system extracted 889 lesions from 478 reports. The mean number of imaging features per lesion was 6.5 ± 2.1 (range: 3-9; 95% CI: 6.362-6.638). The mean number of imaging features per index lesion was 8.0 ± 1.1 (range: 5-9; 95% CI: 7.901-8.099). The NLP system demonstrated a recall of 100.0% and a precision of 99.6% for correct identification of the index lesion. The recall and precision of NLP to correctly extract the value of imaging features from the index lesions were 91.0 and 92.6%, respectively. The recall and precision for the correct identification of the BI-RADS categories were 96.6 and 94.8%, respectively. NLP generated the total results in less than 1 s, whereas the manual reviewers averaged 4.47 min and 4.56 min per report. Conclusions:

109,Mining clinical phrases from nursing notes to discover risk factors of patient deterioration,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Early identification and treatment of patient deterioration is crucial to improving clinical outcomes. To act, hospital rapid response (RR) teams often rely on nurses' clinical judgement typically documented narratively in the electronic health record (EHR). We developed a data-driven, unsupervised method to discover potential risk factors of RR events from nursing notes. Methods:
      
    

    
      We applied multiple natural language processing methods, including language modelling, word embeddings, and two phrase mining methods (TextRank and NC-Value), to identify quality phrases that represent clinical entities from unannotated nursing notes. TextRank was used to determine the important word-sequences in each note. NC-Value was then used to globally rank the locally-important sequences across the whole corpus. We evaluated our method both on its accuracy compared to human judgement and on the ability of the mined phrases to predict a clinical outcome, RR event hazard. Results:
      
    

    
      When applied to 61,740 hospital encounters with 1,067 RR events and 778,955 notes, our method achieved an average precision of 0.590 to 0.764 (when excluding numeric tokens). Time-dependent covariates Cox model using the phrases achieved a concordance index of 0.739. Clustering the phrases revealed clinical concepts significantly associated with RR event hazard. Discussion:
      
    

    
      Our findings demonstrate that our minimal-annotation, unsurprised method can rapidly mine quality phrases from a large amount of nursing notes, and these identified phrases are useful for downstream tasks, such as clinical outcome predication and risk factor identification.","[""1 Division of General Internal Medicine and Primary Care, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, United States; Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States.

110,Detecting adverse drug reactions in discharge summaries of electronic medical records using Readpeer,"Background:
      
    

    
      Hospital discharge summaries offer a potentially rich resource to enhance pharmacovigilance efforts to evaluate drug safety in real-world clinical practice. However, it is infeasible for experts to read through all discharge summaries to find cases of drug-adverse event (AE) relations. Purpose:
      
    

    
      The objective of this paper is to develop a natural language processing (NLP) framework to detect drug-AE relations from unstructured hospital discharge summaries. Basic procedures:
      
    

    
      An NLP algorithm was designed using customized dictionaries of drugs, adverse event (AE) terms, and rules based on trigger phrases, negations, fuzzy logic and word distances to recognize drug, AE terms and to detect drug-AE relations. Furthermore, a customized annotation tool was developed to facilitate expert review of discharge summaries from a tertiary hospital in Singapore in 2011. Main findings:
      
    

    
      A total of 33 trial sets with 50 to 100 records per set were evaluated (1620 discharge summaries) by our algorithm and reviewed by pharmacovigilance experts. After every 6 trial sets, drug and AE dictionaries were updated, and rules were modified to improve the system. Excellent performance was achieved for drug and AE entity recognition with over 92% precision and recall. On the final 6 sets of discharge summaries (600 records), our algorithm achieved 75% precision and 59% recall for identification of valid drug-AE relations. Principal conclusions:
      
    

    
      Adverse drug reactions are a significant contributor to health care costs and utilization. Our algorithm is not restricted to particular drugs, drug classes or specific medical specialties, which is an important attribute for a national regulatory authority to carry out comprehensive safety monitoring of drug products. Drug and AE dictionaries may be updated periodically to ensure that the tool remains relevant for performing surveillance activities. The development of the algorithm, and the ease of reviewing and correcting the results of the algorithm as part of an iterative machine learning process, is an important step towards use of hospital discharge summaries for an active pharmacovigilance program.","['1 Department of Computer Science, School of Computing, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', '2 Vigilance & Compliance Branch, Health Products Regulation Group, Health Sciences Authority, Singapore.', '3 Vigilance & Compliance Branch, Health Products Regulation Group, Health Sciences Authority, Singapore; Genome Institute of Singapore, Agency for Science and Technology, Singapore.', '4 Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, National University Health System, Singapore.', '5 Vigilance & Compliance Branch, Health Products Regulation Group, Health Sciences Authority, Singapore; Health Services and Systems Research, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore.', '6 Department of Computer Science, School of Computing, National University of Singapore, Singapore.

Using full-length second-trimester fetal ultrasound videos and text derived from accompanying expert voice-over audio recordings, we train deep learning models consisting of convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks in merged configurations to generate captions for ultrasound video frames. We evaluate different model architectures using established general metrics (BLEU, ROUGE-L) and application-specific metrics.

      The assessment of written medical examinations is a tedious and expensive process, requiring significant amounts of time from medical experts. Our objective was to develop a natural language processing (NLP) system that can expedite the assessment of unstructured answers in medical examinations by automatically identifying relevant concepts in the examinee responses. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      Our NLP system, Intelligent Clinical Text Evaluator (INCITE), is semi-supervised in nature. Learning from a limited set of fully annotated examples, it sequentially applies a series of customized text comparison and similarity functions to determine if a text span represents an entry in a given reference standard. Combinations of fuzzy matching and set intersection-based methods capture inexact matches and also fragmented concepts. Customizable, dynamic similarity-based matching thresholds allow the system to be tailored for examinee responses of different lengths. Results:
      
    

    
      INCITE achieved an average F1-score of 0.89 (precision = 0.87, recall = 0.91) against human annotations over held-out evaluation data. Fuzzy text matching, dynamic thresholding and the incorporation of supervision using annotated data resulted in the biggest jumps in performances. Discussion:
      
    

    
      Long and non-standard expressions are difficult for INCITE to detect, but the problem is mitigated by the use of dynamic thresholding (i.e., varying the similarity threshold for a text span to be considered a match). Annotation variations within exams and disagreements between annotators were the primary causes for false positives. Small amounts of annotated data can significantly improve system performance. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The high performance and interpretability of INCITE will likely significantly aid the assessment process and also help mitigate the impact of manual assessment inconsistencies.","['1 Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.

115,Evolving Role and Future Directions of Natural Language Processing in Gastroenterology,"In line with the current trajectory of healthcare reform, significant emphasis has been placed on improving the utilization of data collected during a clinical encounter. Although the structured fields of electronic health records have provided a convenient foundation on which to begin such efforts, it was well understood that a substantial portion of relevant information is confined in the free-text narratives documenting care. Unfortunately, extracting meaningful information from such narratives is a non-trivial task, traditionally requiring significant manual effort. Today, computational approaches from a field known as Natural Language Processing (NLP) are poised to make a transformational impact in the analysis and utilization of these documents across healthcare practice and research, particularly in procedure-heavy sub-disciplines such as gastroenterology (GI). As such, this manuscript provides a clinically focused review of NLP systems in GI practice. It begins with a detailed synopsis around the state of NLP techniques, presenting state-of-the-art methods and typical use cases in both clinical settings and across other domains. Next, it will present a robust literature review around current applications of NLP within four prominent areas of gastroenterology including endoscopy, inflammatory bowel disease, pancreaticobiliary, and liver diseases. Finally, it concludes with a discussion of open problems and future opportunities of this technology in the field of gastroenterology and health care as a whole.","['1 Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Medicine, 5000 Holmes Street, Kansas City, MO, 64110, USA. nehme.fredy@gmail.com.', ""2 Division of Health Services and Outcomes Research, Children's Mercy Kansas City, Kansas City, MO, USA."", '3 Department of Pediatrics, University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Medicine, Kansas City, MO, USA.']","Fredy Nehme, Keith Feldman, ",Digestive diseases and sciences,2020,Artificial intelligence; Gastroenterology; Health care; Natural Language Processing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32107677

NLP as such adds structure to the report and exposes the information, which in turn can be used for further analysis. This paper describes pre-processing and processing steps and highlights important challenges to overcome in order to successfully implement a free text mining algorithm using NLP tools and machine learning in a small language area, like Dutch. A rule-based algorithm was constructed to classify T-stage of pulmonary oncology from the original free text radiological report, based on the items tumor size, presence and involvement according to the 8th TNM classification system. PyContextNLP, spaCy and regular expressions were used as tools to extract the correct information and process the free text. Overall accuracy of the algorithm for evaluating T-stage was 0,83 in the training set and 0,87 in the validation set, which shows that the approach in this pilot study is promising. Future research with larger datasets and external validation is needed to be able to introduce more machine learning approaches and perhaps to reduce required input efforts of domain-specific knowledge. However, a hybrid NLP approach will probably achieve the best results.","['1 Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Maastricht University Medical Center+, Postbox 5800, 6202, Maastricht, AZ, Netherlands. martijn.nobel@mumc.nl.', '2 School of Health Professions Education, Maastricht University, Maastricht, Netherlands. martijn.nobel@mumc.nl.', '3 Department of Radiation Oncology (MAASTRO), GROW School for Oncology and Developmental Biology, Maastricht University Medical Center+, Maastricht, Netherlands.', '4 Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Maastricht University Medical Center+, Postbox 5800, 6202, Maastricht, AZ, Netherlands.', '5 School of Health Professions Education, Maastricht University, Maastricht, Netherlands.']","J Martijn Nobel, Sander Puts, Frans C H Bakers, Simon G F Robben, André L A J Dekker, ",Journal of digital imaging,2020 Aug,Classification system; Free text; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Radiology; Reporting.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32076924
118,Using a Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning Algorithm Program to Analyze Inter-Radiologist Report Style Variation and Compare Variation Between Radiologists When Using Highly Structured Versus More Free Text Reporting,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      To use a natural language processing and machine learning algorithm to evaluate inter-radiologist report variation and compare variation between radiologists using highly structured versus more free text reporting. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      28,615 radiology reports were analyzed for 4 metrics: verbosity, observational terms only, unwarranted negative findings, and repeated language in different sections. Radiology reports for two imaging examinations were analyzed and compared - one which was more templated (ultrasound - appendicitis) and one which relied on more free text (chest radiograph - single view). For each metric, the mean and standard deviation for defined outlier results for all dictations (individual and group mean) was calculated. The mean number of outlier metrics per reader per study was calculated and compared between radiologists and between the two report types. Wilcoxon rank test and paired Wilcoxon signed rank test were applied. The radiologists were also ranked based on the number of outlier metrics identified per study. Results:
      
    

    
      There was great variability in radiologist dictation styles - outlier metrics per report varied greatly between radiologists with the maximum 10 times higher than the minimum score. Metric values were greater (P < 0.0001) on the standardized reports using free text than the more structured reports. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The algorithm successfully evaluated metrics showing variability in reporting profiles particularly when there is free text. This variability can be an obstacle to providing effective communication and reliability of care.","[""1 Department of Radiology, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX.

119,Semi-supervised distributed representations of documents for sentiment analysis,"Learning document representation is important in applying machine learning algorithms for sentiment analysis. Distributed representation learning models of words and documents, one of neural language models, have overcome some limits of vector space models such as bag-of-words model and have been utilized successively in many natural language processing tasks including sentiment analysis. However, because such models learn the embeddings only with a context-based objective, it is hard for embeddings to reflect the sentiment of texts. In this research, we address this problem by introducing a semi-supervised sentiment-discriminative objective using partial sentiment information of documents. Our method not only reflects the partial sentiment information, but also preserves local structures induced from original distributed representation learning objectives by considering only sentiment relationships between neighboring documents. Using real-world datasets, the proposed method has been validated by sentiment visualization and classification tasks. The visualization results of Amazon review datasets demonstrate the enhancement of the sentiment class separation when document representations of our proposed method are compared to other methods. Sentiment prediction from our representations also appears to be consistently superior to other representations in both Amazon and Yelp datasets. This work can be extended to develop effective document embeddings applied to other discriminative tasks.","['1 Department of Convergence Security Engineering, Sungshin University, 2 Bomunro, 34Da-Gil, Seongbuk-gu, Seoul, 02844, Republic of Korea.', '2 Industrial Engineering, Seoul National University, 1 Gwanakro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, 08826, Republic of Korea.', '3 Information Technology Management Programme, International Fusion School, Seoul National University of Science & Technology (SeoulTech), 232 Gongreungno, Nowon-gu, Seoul, 01811, Republic of Korea.

124,Development of a lipoplex-type mRNA carrier composed of an ionizable lipid with a vitamin E scaffold and the KALA peptide for use as an ex vivo dendritic cell-based cancer vaccine,"A dendritic cells (DCs)-based vaccine (DC-vaccine) system is an attractive technology for eliciting antigen-specific immune responses that can protect subjects from infectious diseases and for curing various types of cancers. For the insertion of a foreign antigen to DCs, the transfection of an antigen-coding mRNA to the cells is a promising approach. In order to introduce an antigen, a carrier for mRNA transfection is required, since the mRNA molecule per se is unstable in serum-containing medium. We previously reported on an ionizable lipid-like material with vitamin E-scaffolds (ssPalmE) as a material for a lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-based carrier for nucleic acids. In the present study, we report on the development of a lipoplex-type mRNA carrier for use as a DC-vaccine by using a combination of an ssPalmE-LNP and an α-helical cationic peptide ""KALA"" (ssPalmE-KALA). The transfection of mRNAs complexed with the ssPalmE-KALA achieved a significantly higher protein expression and the production of proinflammatory cytokines from murine bone marrow derived DCs (BMDCs) in comparison with a lipoplex that was prepared with an ssPalm with fatty acid-scaffolds (myristic acid; ssPalmM-KALA). A cellular uptake process and a pH-responsive membrane-destabilization activity cannot explain the preferred protein expression and immune-stimulation caused by the ssPalmE-KALA. Proteomic analyses suggest that transfection with the ssPalmM-KALA stimulates a down-regulatory pathway of translation, while the transfection with the ssPalmE-KALA does not stimulate it. In the vaccination with the BMDCs that were preliminarily transfected with an ovalbumin (OVA)-encoding mRNA elicited the induction OVA specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity in vivo. In parallel, the vaccination induced significant prophylactic anti-tumor effects against a model tumor that stably expressed the OVA protein. Based on the above findings, the ssPalmE-KALA appears to be a potent ex vivo DCs-based RNA vaccine platform.","['1 Laboratory of DDS Design and Drug Disposition, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chiba University, 1-8-1 Inohana, Chuo-ku, Chiba City, Chiba, Japan.', '2 Laboratory of DDS Design and Drug Disposition, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chiba University, 1-8-1 Inohana, Chuo-ku, Chiba City, Chiba, Japan.

126,Role of Pd(II)-chitooligosaccharides-Gboxin analog in oxidative phosphorylation inhibition and energy depletion: Targeting mitochondrial dynamics,"In this work, we have successfully upgraded the crab wastes into Pd(II) complex of Gboxin analog-chitooligosaccharides conjugate (Pd(II)COS@GbA). This new complex has a high capacity to inhibit the proliferation of prostate cancer cells (IC50 = 1.92 μg/ml). This activity could be attributed to its ability to induce mitochondrial fragmentation through increasing mitochondrial fission dynamin-related protein 1 (p < .05) and down-regulation of optic atrophy 1 proteins (p < .05). Moreover, this complex can effectively disrupt ATP synthase action leading to declined ATP production, along with downstream of ATPase inhibitor factor1 that hinder energy production in the cancer cells. Also, it has an anti-inflammatory effect by triggering modulators for the release of inflammatory molecules such as TNF-α (p < .05), IL-6 (p < .05), and mRNA transcripts of COX-II (p < .01). Therefore, Pd(II)COS@GbA exhibited significant anti-prostate cancer activity through different mechanisms in inducing energy depletion and mitochondrial fragmentation leading to disrupted oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Complex Pd(II)COS@GbA is more cytotoxic for PC3 than RWPE-1 which in turn means it is may act as a selective cytotoxic agent for prostate cancer.","['1 Biology Department, Faculty of Science, King Khalid University, Abha, Saudi Arabia.', '2 Cell Culture Lab, Egyptian Organization for Biological Products and Vaccines (VACSERA Holding Company), Giza, Egypt.', '3 Chemistry Department, Faculty of Science, Suez University, Suez, Egypt.', '4 Institut für Anorganische Chemie und Strukturchemie, Heinriche-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf, DÜSSELDORF, Germany.', '5 Zoology Department, Faculty of Science, Suez University, Suez, Egypt.']","Serag Eldin I Elbehairi, Mohammad Y Alfaifi, Ali A Shati, Mohammed A Alshehri, Reda F M Elshaarawy, Hani S Hafez, ",Chemical biology & drug design,2020,Pd(II)-chitooligosaccharides-Gboxin analog; anti-inflammatory; anti-prostate cancer; mitochondrial dynamics; oxidative phosphorylation.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32400098
127,Automated SNOMED CT concept and attribute relationship detection through a web-based implementation of cTAKES,"Background:
      
    

    
      Information in Electronic Health Records is largely stored as unstructured free text. Natural language processing (NLP), or Medical Language Processing (MLP) in medicine, aims at extracting structured information from free text, and is less expensive and time-consuming than manual extraction. However, most algorithms in MLP are institution-specific or address only one clinical need, and thus cannot be broadly applied. In addition, most MLP systems do not detect concepts in misspelled text and cannot detect attribute relationships between concepts. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate an MLP application that includes generic algorithms for the detection of (misspelled) concepts and of attribute relationships between them. Methods:
      
    

    
      An implementation of the MLP system cTAKES, called DIRECT, was developed with generic SNOMED CT concept filter, concept relationship detection, and attribute relationship detection algorithms and a custom dictionary. Four implementations of cTAKES were evaluated by comparing 98 manually annotated oncology charts with the output of DIRECT. The F1-score was determined for named-entity recognition and attribute relationship detection for the concepts 'lung cancer', 'non-small cell lung cancer', and 'recurrence'. The performance of the four implementations was compared with a two-tailed permutation test. Results:
      
    

    
      DIRECT detected lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer concepts with F1-scores between 0.828 and 0.947 and between 0.862 and 0.933, respectively. The concept recurrence was detected with a significantly higher F1-score of 0.921, compared to the other implementations, and the relationship between recurrence and lung cancer with an F1-score of 0.857. The precision of the detection of lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and recurrence concepts were 1.000, 0.966, and 0.879, compared to precisions of 0.943, 0.967, and 0.000 in the original implementation, respectively. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      DIRECT can detect oncology concepts and attribute relationships with high precision and can detect recurrence with significant increase in F1-score, compared to the original implementation of cTAKES, due to the usage of a custom dictionary and a generic concept relationship detection algorithm. These concepts and relationships can be used to encode clinical narratives, and can thus substantially reduce manual chart abstraction efforts, saving time for clinicians and researchers.","['1 Department of Medical Informatics, Amsterdam Public Health Research Institute, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 9, 1105AZ, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. m.g.kersloot@amsterdamumc.nl.', '2 School of Health Information Science, University of Victoria, Victoria, Canada.', '3 Department of Medical Informatics, Amsterdam Public Health Research Institute, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 9, 1105AZ, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']","Martijn G Kersloot, Francis Lau, Ameen Abu-Hanna, Derk L Arts, Ronald Cornet, ",Journal of biomedical semantics,2019,Algorithms; Chart abstraction; Electronic health records; Natural language processing; SNOMED CT.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31533810
128,Big data in status epilepticus,"Status epilepticus care and treatment are already being touched by the revolution in data science. New approaches designed to leverage the tremendous potential of ""big data"" in the clinical sphere are enabling researchers and clinicians to extract information from sources such as administrative claims data, the electronic medical health record, and continuous physiologic monitoring data streams. Algorithmic methods of data extraction also offer potential to fuse multimodal data (including text-based documentation, imaging data, and time-series data) to improve patient assessment and stratification beyond the manual capabilities of individual physicians. Still, the potential of data science to impact the diagnosis, treatment, and minute-to-minute care of patients with status epilepticus is only starting to be appreciated. In this brief review, we discuss how data science is impacting the field and draw examples from the following three main areas: (1) analysis of insurance claims from large administrative datasets to evaluate the impact of continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring on clinical outcomes; (2) natural language processing of the electronic health record to find, classify, and stratify patients for prognostication and treatment; and (3) real-time systems for data analysis, data reduction, and multimodal data fusion to guide therapy in real time. While early, it is our hope that these examples will stimulate investigators to leverage data science, computer science, and engineering methods to improve the care and outcome of patients with status epilepticus and other neurological disorders.

129,"Triple Combination of Ascorbate, Menadione and the Inhibition of Peroxiredoxin-1 Produces Synergistic Cytotoxic Effects in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cells","Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive form of mammary malignancy currently without satisfactory systemic treatment options. Agents generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as ascorbate (Asc) and menadione (Men), especially applied in combination, have been proposed as an alternative anticancer modality. However, their effectiveness can be hampered by the cytoprotective effects of elevated antioxidant enzymes (e.g., peroxiredoxins, PRDX) in cancer. In this study, PRDX1 mRNA and protein expression were assessed in TNBC tissues by analysis of the online RNA-seq datasets and immunohistochemical staining of tissue microarray, respectively. We demonstrated that PRDX1 mRNA expression was markedly elevated in primary TNBC tumors as compared to non-malignant controls, with PRDX1 protein staining intensity correlating with favorable survival parameters. Subsequently, PRDX1 functionality in TNBC cell lines or non-malignant mammary cells was targeted by genetic silencing or chemically by auranofin (AUR). The PRDX1-knockdown or AUR treatment resulted in inhibition of the growth of TNBC cells in vitro. These cytotoxic effects were further synergistically potentiated by the incubation with a combination of the prooxidant agents, Asc and Men. In conclusion, we report that the PRDX1-related antioxidant system is essential for maintaining redox homeostasis in TNBC cells and can be an attractive therapeutic target in combination with ROS-generating agents.","['1 Department of Clinical Immunology, Medical University of Warsaw, Nowogrodzka 59, 02-006 Warsaw, Poland.', '2 Department of Immunology, Medical University of Warsaw, Nielubowicza 5, 02-097 Warsaw, Poland.', '3 Postgraduate School of Molecular Medicine, Medical University of Warsaw, Trojdena 2a, 02-091 Warsaw, Poland.', '4 International Centre for Cancer Vaccine Science, University of Gdansk, Wita Stwosza 63, 80-308 Gdansk, Poland.', '5 Cancer Biology and Therapeutics Laboratory, UCD School of Biomolecular and Biomedical Science, UCD Conway Institute, University College Dublin, D04 Dublin 4, Ireland.', '6 OncoMark Ltd., Nova UCD, D04 Dublin 4, Ireland.', '7 Department of Immunology, Transplantology, and Internal Diseases, Medical University of Warsaw, Nowogrodzka 59, 02-006 Warsaw, Poland.']","Malgorzata Bajor, Agnieszka Graczyk-Jarzynka, Katsiaryna Marhelava, Malgorzata Kurkowiak, Arman Rahman, Claudia Aura, Niamh Russell, Agata O Zych, Malgorzata Firczuk, Magdalena Winiarska, William M Gallagher, Radoslaw Zagozdzon, ","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2020,antioxidant enzyme; augmented prooxidant therapy; prooxidant agents; triple therapeutic combination; triple-negative breast cancer.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32316111
130,Using natural language processing and machine learning to classify health literacy from secure messages: The ECLIPPSE study,"Limited health literacy is a barrier to optimal healthcare delivery and outcomes. Current measures requiring patients to self-report limitations are time-consuming and may be considered intrusive by some. This makes widespread classification of patient health literacy challenging. The objective of this study was to develop and validate ""literacy profiles"" as automated indicators of patients' health literacy to facilitate a non-intrusive, economic and more comprehensive characterization of health literacy among a health care delivery system's membership. To this end, three literacy profiles were generated based on natural language processing (combining computational linguistics and machine learning) using a sample of 283,216 secure messages sent from 6,941 patients to their primary care physicians. All patients were participants in Kaiser Permanente Northern California's DISTANCE Study. Performance of the three literacy profiles were compared against a gold standard of patient self-reported health literacy. Associations were analyzed between each literacy profile and patient demographics, health outcomes and healthcare utilization. T-tests were used for numeric data such as A1C, Charlson comorbidity index and healthcare utilization rates, and chi-square tests for categorical data such as sex, race, poor adherence and severe hypoglycemia. Literacy profiles varied in their test characteristics, with C-statistics ranging from 0.61-0.74. Relations between literacy profiles and health outcomes revealed patterns consistent with previous health literacy research: patients identified via literacy profiles indicative of limited health literacy: (a) were older and more likely of minority status; (b) had poorer medication adherence and glycemic control; and (c) exhibited higher rates of hypoglycemia, comorbidities and healthcare utilization. This represents the first successful attempt to employ natural language processing to estimate health literacy. Literacy profiles can offer an automated and economical way to identify patients with limited health literacy and greater vulnerability to poor health outcomes.","['1 Ira A.

131,TGF-β2 interfering oligonucleotides used as adjuvants for microbial vaccines,"The success of using immune checkpoint inhibitors to treat cancers implies that inhibiting an immunosuppressive cytokine, such as TGF-β2, could be a strategy to develop novel adjuvants for microbial vaccines. To develop nucleic acid based TGF-β2 inhibitors, we designed three antisense oligonucleotides, designated as TIO1, TIO2, and TIO3, targeting the conserve regions identical in human and mouse TGF-β2 mRNA 3'-untranslated region. In cultured immune cells, TIO3 and TIO1 significantly reduced the TGF-β2 mRNA expression and protein production. In mice, the TIO3 and TIO1, when formulated in various microbial vaccines, significantly enhanced the antibody response to the vaccines, and the TIO3-adjuvanted influenza virus vaccine induced effective protection against the influenza virus challenge. In the immunized mice, TIO3 formulated in microbial vaccines dramatically reduced surface-bound TGF-β2 expression on CD4+ T cells and CD19+ B cells in the lymph node (LN) cells and spleen cells; up-regulated the expression of CD40, CD80, CD86, and MHC II molecules on CD19+ B cells and CD11c+ dendritic cells; and promoted IFN-γ production in CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells in the LN cells. Overall, TIO3 or TIO1 could be used as a novel type of adjuvant for facilitating the microbial vaccines to elicit more vigorous and persistent antibody response by interfering with TGF-β2 expression.","['1 Department of Immunology, College of Basic Medical Sciences, Norman Bethune Health Science Center, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', '2 Department of Molecular Biology, College of Basic Medical Sciences, Norman Bethune Health Science Center, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.']","Liqun Tu, Xiaomeng Sun, Lei Yang, Tiefeng Zhang, Xian Zhang, Xin Li, Boqi Dong, Ye Liu, Ming Yang, Liying Wang, Yongli Yu, ",Journal of leukocyte biology,2020,3′ UTR; TGF-β2; adjuvant; oligonucleotide; vaccine.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32794350

133,Linguistic summarization of in-home sensor data,"Introduction:
      
    

    
      With the increase in the population of older adults around the world, a significant amount of work has been done on in-home sensor technology to aid the elderly age independently. However, due to the large amounts of data generated by the sensors, it takes a lot of effort and time for the clinicians to makes sense of this data. In this work, we develop a system to help make this data more useful by presenting it in the form of natural language. Methods:
      
    

    
      We start by identifying important attributes in the sensor data that are relevant to the health of the elderly. We then develop algorithms to extract these important health related features from the sensor parameters and summarize them in natural language. We focus on making the natural language summaries to be informative, accurate and concise. Results:
      
    

    
      We designed multiple surveys using real and synthetic data to validate the summaries produced by our algorithms. We show that the algorithms produce meaningful results comparable to human subjects. We also implemented our linguistic summarization system to produce summaries of data leading to health alerts derived from the sensor data. The system is running live in 110 apartments currently. By the means of retrospective case studies, we illustrate that the linguistic summaries are able to make the connection between changes in the sensor data and the health of the elderly. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We present a system that extracts important clinically relevant features from in-home sensor data generated in the apartments of the elderly and summarize those features in natural language. The preliminary testing of our summarization system shows that it has the potential to help the clinicians utilize this data effectively.","['1 Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Missouri, USA.

134,Facilitating accurate health provider directories using natural language processing,"Background:
      
    

    
      Accurate information in provider directories are vital in health care including health information exchange, health benefits exchange, quality reporting, and in the reimbursement and delivery of care. Maintaining provider directory data and keeping it up to date is challenging. The objective of this study is to determine the feasibility of using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to combine disparate resources and acquire accurate information on health providers. Methods:
      
    

    
      Publically available state licensure lists in Connecticut were obtained along with National Plan and Provider Enumeration System (NPPES) public use files. Connecticut licensure lists textual information of each health professional who is licensed to practice within the state. A NLP-based system was developed based on healthcare provider taxonomy code, location, name and address information to identify textual data within the state and federal records. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation were performed, and the recall and precision were calculated. Results:
      
    

    
      We identified nurse midwives, nurse practitioners, and dentists in the State of Connecticut. The recall and precision were 0.95 and 0.93 respectively. Using the system, we were able to accurately acquire 6849 of the 7177 records of health provider directory information. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The authors demonstrated that the NLP- based approach was effective at acquiring health provider information. Furthermore, the NLP-based system can always be applied to update information further reducing processing burdens as data changes.","['1 Center for Quantitative Medicine, University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, CT, 06030, USA.', '2 Office of the Vice President for Research, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, 06269, USA.', '3 Department of Community Medicine and Health Care, University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, CT, 06030, USA.', '4 Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.', '5 Center for Quantitative Medicine, University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, CT, 06030, USA. xiaowang@uchc.edu.', '6 Department of Community Medicine and Health Care, University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, CT, 06030, USA. xiaowang@uchc.edu.', '7 Department of Family Medicine, University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, CT, 06030, USA. xiaowang@uchc.edu.']","Matthew J Cook, Lixia Yao, Xiaoyan Wang, ",BMC medical informatics and decision making,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30943977
135,Natural language processing to identify ureteric stones in radiology reports,"Introduction:
      
    

    
      Natural language processing (NLP) is an emerging tool which has the ability to automate data extraction from large volumes of unstructured text. One of the main described uses of NLP in radiology is cohort building for epidemiological studies. This study aims to assess the accuracy of NLP in identifying a group of patients positive for ureteric stones on Computed Tomography - Kidneys, Ureter, Bladder (CT KUB) reports. Methods:
      
    

    
      Retrospective review of all CT KUB reports in a single calendar year. A locally available NLP tool was used to automatically classify the reports based on positivity for ureteric stones. This was validated by manual review and refined to maximize the accuracy of stone detection. Results:
      
    

    
      A total of 1874 CT KUB reports were identified. Manual classification of ureteric stone positivity was 36% compared with 27% using NLP. The accuracy of NLP was 85% with a sensitivity of 66% and specificity of 95%. Incorrect classification was due to misspellings, variable syntax, terminology, pluralization and the inability to exclude clinical request details from the search algorithm. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our NLP tool demonstrated high specificity but low sensitivity at identifying CT KUB reports that are positive for ureteric stones. This was attributable to the lack of feature extraction tools tailored for analysing radiology text, incompleteness of the medical lexicon database and heterogeneity of unstructured reports. Improvements in these areas will help improve data extraction accuracy.","['1 Department of Radiology, Canterbury District Health Board, Christchurch, New Zealand.', '2 The Canterbury Initiative, Canterbury District Health Board, Christchurch, New Zealand.']","Andrew Yu Li, Nikki Elliot, ",Journal of medical imaging and radiation oncology,2019 Jun,information science; natural language processing; renal colic; ureteral calculi; urinary tract imaging.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30720244
136,A natural language processing algorithm to extract characteristics of subdural hematoma from head CT reports,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      Subdural hematoma (SDH) is the most common form of traumatic intracranial hemorrhage, and radiographic characteristics of SDH are predictive of complications and patient outcomes. We created a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm to extract structured data from cranial computed tomography (CT) scan reports for patients with SDH. Methods:
      
    

    
      CT scan reports from patients with SDH were collected from a single center. All reports were based on cranial CT scan interpretations by board-certified attending radiologists. Reports were then coded by a pair of physicians for four variables: number of SDH, size of midline shift, thickness of largest SDH, and side of largest SDH. Inter-rater reliability was assessed. The annotated reports were divided into training (80%) and test (20%) datasets. Relevant information was extracted from text using a pattern-matching approach, due to the lack of a mention-level gold-standard corpus. Then, the NLP pipeline components were integrated using the Apache Unstructured Information Management Architecture. Output performance was measured as algorithm accuracy compared to the data coded by the two ED physicians. Results:
      
    

    
      A total of 643 scans were extracted. The NLP algorithm accuracy was high: 0.84 for side of largest SDH, 0.88 for thickness of largest SDH, and 0.92 for size of midline shift. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      A NLP algorithm can structure key data from non-contrast head CT reports with high accuracy. The NLP is a potential tool to detect important radiographic findings from electronic health records, and, potentially, add decision support capabilities.","['1 Department of Emergency Medicine, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA. peter.pruitt@northwestern.edu.', '2 Center for Healthcare Studies, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, 633 N St. Clair Street, Chicago, IL, 60622, USA. peter.pruitt@northwestern.edu.', '3 Center for Healthcare Studies, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, 633 N St. Clair Street, Chicago, IL, 60622, USA.', '4 Department of Neurology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', '5 Harvard Affiliated Emergency Medicine Residency, Boston, MA, USA.', '6 Department of Emergency Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, 55 Fruit Street, Boston, MA, 02114, USA.', '7 Department of Emergency Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', '8 Center for Health Information Partnerships, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, 625 N Michigan Ave., Chicago, IL, 60611, USA.']","Peter Pruitt, Andrew Naidech, Jonathan Van Ornam, Pierre Borczuk, William Thompson, ",Emergency radiology,2019 Jun,Cranial CT reports; Intracranial hemorrhage; Natural language processing; Subdural hematoma.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30693414
137,A neural classification method for supporting the creation of BioVerbNet,"Background:
      
    

    
      VerbNet, an extensive computational verb lexicon for English, has proved useful for supporting a wide range of Natural Language Processing tasks requiring information about the behaviour and meaning of verbs. Biomedical text processing and mining could benefit from a similar resource. We take the first step towards the development of BioVerbNet: A VerbNet specifically aimed at describing verbs in the area of biomedicine. Because VerbNet-style classification is extremely time consuming, we start from a small manual classification of biomedical verbs and apply a state-of-the-art neural representation model, specifically developed for class-based optimization, to expand the classification with new verbs, using all the PubMed abstracts and the full articles in the PubMed Central Open Access subset as data. Results:
      
    

    
      Direct evaluation of the resulting classification against BioSimVerb (verb similarity judgement data in biomedicine) shows promising results when representation learning is performed using verb class-based contexts. Human validation by linguists and biologists reveals that the automatically expanded classification is highly accurate. Including novel, valid member verbs and classes, our method can be used to facilitate cost-effective development of BioVerbNet. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      This work constitutes the first effort on applying a state-of-the-art architecture for neural representation learning to biomedical verb classification. While we discuss future optimization of the method, our promising results suggest that the automatic classification released with this article can be used to readily support application tasks in biomedicine.","['1 Language Technology Laboratory, MML, University of Cambridge, 9 West Road, Cambridge, CB39DB, UK. hwc25@cam.ac.uk.', '2 Language Technology Laboratory, MML, University of Cambridge, 9 West Road, Cambridge, CB39DB, UK.', '3 Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 1QW, UK.', '4 Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, 210-171-77, Sweden.', '5 Department of Linguistics, University of Colorado at Boulder, Colorado, 80309-0295, USA.']","Billy Chiu, Olga Majewska, Sampo Pyysalo, Laura Wey, Ulla Stenius, Anna Korhonen, Martha Palmer, ",Journal of biomedical semantics,2019,Representation learning; Verb lexicon.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30658707

139,Immunogenicity and Protection Efficacy of a Naked Self-Replicating mRNA-Based Zika Virus Vaccine,"To combat emerging infectious diseases like Zika virus (ZIKV), synthetic messenger RNAs (mRNAs) encoding viral antigens are very attractive as they allow a rapid, generic, and flexible production of vaccines. In this work, we engineered a self-replicating mRNA (sr-mRNA) vaccine encoding the pre-membrane and envelope (prM-E) glycoproteins of ZIKV. Intradermal electroporation of as few as 1 µg of this mRNA-based ZIKV vaccine induced potent humoral and cellular immune responses in BALB/c and especially IFNAR1-/- C57BL/6 mice, resulting in a complete protection of the latter mice against ZIKV infection. In wild-type C57BL/6 mice, the vaccine resulted in very low seroconversion rates and antibody titers. The potency of the vaccine was inversely related to the dose of mRNA used in wild-type BALB/c or C57BL/6 mice, as robust type I interferon (IFN) response was determined in a reporter mice model (IFN-β+/Δβ-luc). We further investigated the inability of the sr-prM-E-mRNA ZIKV vaccine to raise antibodies in wild-type C57BL/6 mice and found indications that type I IFNs elicited by this naked sr-mRNA vaccine might directly impede the induction of a robust humoral response. Therefore, we assume that the efficacy of sr-mRNA vaccines after intradermal electroporation might be increased by strategies that temper their inherent innate immunogenicity.","['1 Laboratory of Gene Therapy, Department of Nutrition, Genetics and Ethology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ghent University, Heidestraat 19, 9820 Merelbeke, Belgium.', '2 Cancer Research Institute (CRIG), Ghent University, 9000 Ghent, Belgium.', '3 Department of Morphology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ghent University, Salisburylaan 133, 9820 Merelbeke, Belgium.', '4 Barriers in Inflammation Lab, Department of Biomedical molecular biology, Faculty of Sciences, Ghent University, Technologiepark-Zwijnaarde 71, 9052 Zwijnaarde, Belgium.', '5 VIB Center for Inflammation Research, VIB, Technologiepark-Zwijnaarde 71, 9052 Zwijnaarde, Belgium.', '6 Laboratory of Immunology, Department of Virology, Parasitology and Immunology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ghent University, Salisburylaan 133, 9820 Merelbeke, Belgium.', '7 Department of Immunology, Fraunhofer Institute for Cell Therapy and Immunology, Perlickstr. 1, 04103 Leipzig, Germany.', '8 Unit of Neglected Tropical Diseases, Department of Clinical Sciences, Institute of Tropical Medicine, 2000 Antwerp, Belgium.', '9 Virology Unit, Institute of Tropical Medicine, 2000 Antwerp, Belgium.', '10 Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Antwerp, 2000 Antwerp, Belgium.', '11 Laboratory of Gene Therapy, Department of Nutrition, Genetics and Ethology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ghent University, Heidestraat 19, 9820 Merelbeke, Belgium. niek.Sanders@ugent.be.', '12 Cancer Research Institute (CRIG), Ghent University, 9000 Ghent, Belgium. niek.Sanders@ugent.be.']","Zifu Zhong, João Paulo Portela Catani, Séan Mc Cafferty, Liesbeth Couck, Wim Van Den Broeck, Nina Gorlé, Roosmarijn E Vandenbroucke, Bert Devriendt, Sebastian Ulbert, Lieselotte Cnops, Johan Michels, Kevin K Ariën, Niek N Sanders, ",Vaccines,2019,IFNAR1 knockout mice; Zika virus vaccine; self-replicating mRNA; type I interferon response.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31450775

      To develop a natural language processing (NLP)-based algorithm for extracting clinically useful information for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from Chinese electronic medical records (EMRs) and use these data for the assessment of HCC staging. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      Clinical documents, including operation notes, radiology and pathology reports, of 92 HCC patients were collected from Chinese EMRs. We randomly grouped these patients into training (n = 60) and testing (n = 32) datasets. Rule-based and hybrid methods for extracting information were developed using the training set of manually-annotated operation notes. The method with better performance was used to process other documents. The performance of the algorithm was assessed via calculating the precision, recall and F-score for exact-boundary and partial-boundary matching strategies. The utility of clinically useful information for the HCC staging was assessed in comparison with that manually reviewed. Results:
      
    

    
      For operation notes, the rule-based and hybrid methods had a precision, recall and F-score ≥80% when the exact-boundary and partial-boundary matching strategies were applied to the testing dataset. By using the rule-based method (which has better performance than the hybrid method), three other types of documents also obtained good performance. When the extracted clinically useful information was applied for the HCC staging, the concordance rate with the manual review was 75%. Conclusion:

146,Zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP) is a restriction factor for replication of modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) in human cells,"Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) is an approved smallpox vaccine and a promising vaccine vector for other pathogens as well as for cancer therapeutics with more than 200 current or completed clinical trials. MVA was derived by passaging the parental Ankara vaccine virus hundreds of times in chick embryo fibroblasts during which it lost the ability to replicate in human and most other mammalian cells. Although this replication deficiency is an important safety feature, the genetic basis of the host restriction is not understood. Here, an unbiased human genome-wide RNAi screen in human A549 cells revealed that the zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP), previously shown to inhibit certain RNA viruses, is a host restriction factor for MVA, a DNA virus. Additional studies demonstrated enhanced MVA replication in several human cell lines following knockdown of ZAP. Furthermore, CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of ZAP in human A549 cells increased MVA replication and spread by more than one log but had no effect on a non-attenuated strain of vaccinia virus. The intact viral C16 protein, which had been disrupted in MVA, antagonized ZAP by binding and sequestering the protein in cytoplasmic punctate structures. Studies aimed at exploring the mechanism by which ZAP restricts MVA replication in the absence of C16 showed that knockout of ZAP had no discernible effect on viral DNA or individual mRNA or protein species as determined by droplet digital polymerase chain reaction, deep RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry, respectively. Instead, inactivation of ZAP reduced the number of aberrant, dense, spherical particles that typically form in MVA-infected human cells, suggesting that ZAP has a novel role in interfering with a late step in the assembly of infectious MVA virions in the absence of the C16 protein.","['1 Laboratory of Viral Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States of America.', '2 Division of Preclinical Innovation, National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States of America.']","Chen Peng, Linda S Wyatt, Shira G Glushakow-Smith, Madhu Lal-Nag, Andrea S Weisberg, Bernard Moss, ",PLoS pathogens,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32866210

150,Intramuscular Delivery of Replicon RNA Encoding ZIKV-117 Human Monoclonal Antibody Protects against Zika Virus Infection,"Monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapeutics are an effective modality for the treatment of infectious, autoimmune, and cancer-related diseases. However, the discovery, development, and manufacturing processes are complex, resource-consuming activities that preclude the rapid deployment of mAbs in outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases. Given recent advances in nucleic acid delivery technology, it is now possible to deliver exogenous mRNA encoding mAbs for in situ expression following intravenous (i.v.) infusion of lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated mRNA. However, the requirement for i.v. administration limits the application to settings where infusion is an option, increasing the cost of treatment. As an alternative strategy, and to enable intramuscular (IM) administration of mRNA-encoded mAbs, we describe a nanostructured lipid carrier for delivery of an alphavirus replicon encoding a previously described highly neutralizing human mAb, ZIKV-117. Using a lethal Zika virus challenge model in mice, our studies show robust protection following alphavirus-driven expression of ZIKV-117 mRNA when given by IM administration as pre-exposure prophylaxis or post-exposure therapy.","['1 Pre-Clinical Vaccine Development, Infectious Disease Research Institute, Seattle, WA, USA.', '2 HDT Biocorp, Seattle, WA, USA.', '3 Department of Microbiology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', '4 The Vanderbilt Vaccine Center, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 27232, USA.', '5 Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.', '6 Department of Molecular Microbiology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.', '7 Department of Pathology & Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.', '8 Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 27232, USA.', '9 Department of Pathology Microbiology & Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 27232, USA.']","Jesse H Erasmus, Jacob Archer, Jasmine Fuerte-Stone, Amit P Khandhar, Emily Voigt, Brian Granger, Robin G Bombardi, Jennifer Govero, Qing Tan, Lorellin A Durnell, Rhea N Coler, Michael S Diamond, James E Crowe Jr, Steven G Reed, Larissa B Thackray, Robert H Carnahan, Neal Van Hoeven, ",Molecular therapy.

151,Association between antipsychotic drug dose and length of clinical notes: a proxy of disease severity?,"Background:
      
    

    
      Most structured clinical data, such as diagnosis codes, are not sufficient to obtain precise phenotypes and assess disease burden. Text mining of clinical notes could provide a basis for detailed profiles of phenotypic traits. The objective of the current study was to determine whether drug dose, regardless of polypharmacy, is associated with the length of clinical notes, and to determine the frequency of adverse events per word in clinical notes. Methods:
      
    

    
      In this observational study, we utilized restricted-access data from an electronic patient record system. Using three methods (defined daily dose, olanzapine equivalents, and chlorpromazine equivalents) we calculated antipsychotic dose equivalents and compared these with the number of words recorded per treatment day. For each normalization method, the frequencies of adverse events per word in manually curated samples were compared to dose intervals. Results:
      
    

    
      The length of clinical notes per treatment day was positively associated with the prescribed dose for all normalization methods. The number of adverse events per word was stable over the analyzed dose spectrum. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Assuming that drug dose increases with the severity of disease, the length of clinical notes can serve as a proxy for disease severity. Due to the near-linear relationship, correction of daily word count is unnecessary when text mining for potential adverse drug reactions.","['1 Disease Systems Biology program, Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research, University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 3B, DK-2200, Copenhagen N, Denmark.', '2 Disease Systems Biology program, Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research, University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 3B, DK-2200, Copenhagen N, Denmark. robert.eriksson@cpr.ku.dk.']","Freja Karuna Hemmingsen Sørup, Søren Brunak, Robert Eriksson, ",BMC medical research methodology,2020,Adverse event; Antipsychotic drugs; Natural language processing; Text mining.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32381026
152,Automatically identifying social isolation from clinical narratives for patients with prostate Cancer,"Background:
      
    

    
      Social isolation is an important social determinant that impacts health outcomes and mortality among patients. The National Academy of Medicine recently recommended that social isolation be documented in electronic health records (EHR). However, social isolation usually is not recorded or obtained as coded data but rather collected from patient self-report or documented in clinical narratives. This study explores the feasibility and effectiveness of natural language processing (NLP) strategy for identifying patients who are socially isolated from clinical narratives. Method:
      
    

    
      We used data from the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) Research Data Warehouse. Patients 18 years-of-age or older who were diagnosed with prostate cancer between January 1, 2014 and May 31, 2017 were eligible for this study. NLP pipelines identifying social isolation were developed via extraction of notes on progress, history and physical, consult, emergency department provider, telephone encounter, discharge summary, plan of care, and radiation oncology. Of 4195 eligible prostate cancer patients, we randomly sampled 3138 patients (75%) as a training dataset. The remaining 1057 patients (25%) were used as a test dataset to evaluate NLP algorithm performance. Standard performance measures for the NLP algorithm, including precision, recall, and F-measure, were assessed by expert manual review using the test dataset. Results:
      
    

    
      A total of 55,516 clinical notes from 3138 patients were included to develop the lexicon and NLP pipelines for social isolation. Of those, 35 unique patients (1.2%) had social isolation mention(s) in 217 notes. Among 24 terms relevant to social isolation, the most prevalent were ""lack of social support,"" ""lonely,"" ""social isolation,"" ""no friends,"" and ""loneliness"". Among 1057 patients in the test dataset, 17 patients (1.6%) were identified as having social isolation mention(s) in 40 clinical notes. Manual review identified four false positive mentions of social isolation and one false negatives in 154 notes from randomly selected 52 controls. The NLP pipeline demonstrated 90% precision, 97% recall, and 93% F-measure. The major reasons for a false positive included the ambiguities of the experiencer of social isolation, negation, and alternate meaning of words. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our NLP algorithms demonstrate a highly accurate approach to identify social isolation.","['1 Biomedical Informatics Center at Medical University of South Carolina, Chalrleston, South Carolina, USA. zhuv@musc.edu.', '2 Biomedical Informatics Center at Medical University of South Carolina, Chalrleston, South Carolina, USA.', '3 Holling Cancer Center and Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, USA.']","Vivienne J Zhu, Leslie A Lenert, Brian E Bunnell, Jihad S Obeid, Melanie Jefferson, Chanita Hughes Halbert, ",BMC medical informatics and decision making,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30871518
153,Does BERT need domain adaptation for clinical negation detection?,"Introduction:
      
    

    
      Classifying whether concepts in an unstructured clinical text are negated is an important unsolved task. New domain adaptation and transfer learning methods can potentially address this issue. Objective:
      
    

    
      We examine neural unsupervised domain adaptation methods, introducing a novel combination of domain adaptation with transformer-based transfer learning methods to improve negation detection. We also want to better understand the interaction between the widely used bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) system and domain adaptation methods. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      We use 4 clinical text datasets that are annotated with negation status. We evaluate a neural unsupervised domain adaptation algorithm and BERT, a transformer-based model that is pretrained on massive general text datasets. We develop an extension to BERT that uses domain adversarial training, a neural domain adaptation method that adds an objective to the negation task, that the classifier should not be able to distinguish between instances from 2 different domains. Results:
      
    

    
      The domain adaptation methods we describe show positive results, but, on average, the best performance is obtained by plain BERT (without the extension). We provide evidence that the gains from BERT are likely not additive with the gains from domain adaptation. Discussion:
      
    

    
      Our results suggest that, at least for the task of clinical negation detection, BERT subsumes domain adaptation, implying that BERT is already learning very general representations of negation phenomena such that fine-tuning even on a specific corpus does not lead to much overfitting. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Despite being trained on nonclinical text, the large training sets of models like BERT lead to large gains in performance for the clinical negation detection task.","[""1 Computational Health Informatics Program, Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."", '2 School of Information, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA.', '3 Department of Computer Science, Loyola University Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', '4 Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']","Chen Lin, Steven Bethard, Dmitriy Dligach, Farig Sadeque, Guergana Savova, Timothy A Miller, ",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2020,deep learning; domain adaptation; machine learning; natural language processing; negation.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32044989
154,Ionizable lipid nanoparticles encapsulating barcoded mRNA for accelerated in vivo delivery screening,"Messenger RNA (mRNA) has recently emerged as a promising class of nucleic acid therapy, with the potential to induce protein production to treat and prevent a range of diseases. However, the widespread use of mRNA as a therapeutic requires safe and effective in vivo delivery technologies. Libraries of ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been designed to encapsulate mRNA, prevent its degradation, and mediate intracellular delivery. However, these LNPs are typically characterized and screened in an in vitro setting, which may not fully replicate the biological barriers that they encounter in vivo. Here, we designed and evaluated a library of engineered LNPs containing barcoded mRNA (b-mRNA) to accelerate the screening of mRNA delivery platforms in vivo. These b-mRNA are similar in structure and function to regular mRNA, and contain barcodes that enable their delivery to be quantified via deep sequencing. Using a mini-library of b-mRNA LNPs formulated via microfluidic mixing, we show that these different formulations can be pooled together, administered intravenously into mice as a single pool, and their delivery to multiple organs (liver, spleen, brain, lung, heart, kidney, pancreas, and muscle) can be quantified simultaneously using deep sequencing. In the context of liver and spleen delivery, LNPs that exhibited high b-mRNA delivery also yielded high luciferase expression, indicating that this platform can identify lead LNP candidates as well as optimal formulation parameters for in vivo mRNA delivery. Interestingly, LNPs with identical formulation parameters that encapsulated different types of nucleic acid barcodes (b-mRNA versus a DNA barcode) altered in vivo delivery, suggesting that the structure of the barcoded nucleic acid affects LNP in vivo delivery. This platform, which enables direct barcoding and subsequent quantification of a functional mRNA, can accelerate the in vivo screening and design of LNPs for mRNA therapeutic applications such as CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, mRNA vaccination, and other mRNA-based regenerative medicine and protein replacement therapies.","['1 Department of Bioengineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States; Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Institute of Biological Sciences, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.', '2 Department of Bioengineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.', '3 Graduate Field of Genetics, Genomics and Development, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, United States.', '4 Gene Therapy Program, Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.', '5 Department of Bioengineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States; Abramson Cancer Center, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States; Institute for Immunology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States; Cardiovascular Institute, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States; Institute for Regenerative Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.

155,Burden of Human Papillomavirus (HPV)-Related Cancers Attributable to HPVs 6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52 and 58,"Background:
      
    

    
      Many countries, mainly high- and upper-middle income, have implemented human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination programs, with 47 million women receiving the full course of vaccine (three doses) in 2014. To evaluate the potential impact of HPV vaccines in the reduction of HPV-related disease, we aimed to estimate the HPV type distribution and burden of anogenital and head and neck cancers attributable to HPV types (HPVs 16/18/31/33/45/52/58/6/11) included in currently licensed HPV vaccines. Methods:
      
    

    
      In all, 18 247 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens were retrieved from 50 countries. HPV DNA detection and typing were performed with the SPF-10 PCR/DEIA/LiPA25 system. With the exception of cervical cancer, HPV DNA-positive samples were additionally subjected to HPV E6*I mRNA detection and/or p16INK4a immunohistochemistry. For cervical cancer, estimates were based on HPV DNA, whereas for other sites, estimates were based on HPV DNA, E6*I mRNA, and p16INK4a biomarkers. Results:
      
    

    
      The addition of HPVs 31/33/45/52/58 to HPVs 16/18/6/11 in the nonavalent HPV vaccine could prevent almost 90% of cervical cancer cases worldwide. For other sites, the nonavalent HPV vaccine could prevent 22.8% of vulvar, 24.5% of penile, 60.7% of vaginal, 79.0% of anal cancers, 21.3% of oropharyngeal, 4.0% of oral cavity, and 2.7% of laryngeal cancer cases. Conclusions:

156,Non-viral nano-immunotherapeutics targeting tumor microenvironmental immune cells,"The tumor microenvironmental immune cells (TMICs) consists of myeloid cells (tumor-associated macrophages, dendritic cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, etc.) and lymphocytes (T cells and B cells), all of which could be immunologically suppressed through their interactions with cancer cells. Immunological understanding of the tumor microenvironment (TME) has led to great success in the development of clinical cancer immunotherapeutic. The most advanced cancer immunotherapies are chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells (CAR-T cells) and checkpoint inhibiting antibodies blocking CTLA4, PD-1 and PD-L1. However, many hurdles remain that should be addressed for improved therapeutic efficacy and reduced side effects such as cytokine release syndrome and patient-death. In recent decades, nanoparticles have been demonstrated as an efficient drug delivery tool due to their ease of modification, biocompatibility and intrinsic tumor targeting effect, and also been applied for cancer immunotherapy. In this review, we briefly introduce the immunosuppressive functions of TMICs and review recent advances in the development of TMIC-targeted nanotherapeutics for cancer immunotherapy. Tumor-associated macrophage (TAM)-targeted systems have shown to deplete or repolarize macrophages to M1 state for anti-tumoral immune responses. Tumor-infiltrating T cell (TIT)-targeted strategies have provided the activation of effector T cells and suppression of regulatory T cells in tumor, overcoming the current hurdles of single regimen checkpoint inhibitors. Lastly, recent studies on dendritic cell-targeted mRNA vaccination are discussed and the future perspectives of nano-immunotherapeutic for next-generation of cancer immunotherapy is emphasized.","['1 Department of Bioengineering, Institute for Bioengineering and Biopharmaceutical Research, BK 21 Plus Future Biopharmaceutical Human Resources Training and Research Team, Hanyang University, 133-791, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', '2 Department of Bioengineering, Institute for Bioengineering and Biopharmaceutical Research, BK 21 Plus Future Biopharmaceutical Human Resources Training and Research Team, Hanyang University, 133-791, Seoul, Republic of Korea.

      Although evidence-based psychotherapies (EBPs) for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were implemented starting in 2005 in the veterans health administration (VHA), the largest national healthcare system in the U.S., the rate of initiation (uptake) and prevalence of these treatments in each calendar year have not been determined. We aimed to elucidate two metrics of EBP utilization, uptake and prevalence, following implementation. Methods:
      
    

    
      Cohort study of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans in VHA (N = 181,620) with a PTSD diagnosis and ≥1 psychotherapy-coded outpatient visit from 2001 to 2014. Using natural language processing techniques, annual and cumulative uptake and prevalence rates from 2001 to 2014 were calculated for each of the two EBPs for PTSD, cognitive processing therapy (CPT) and prolonged exposure (PE) therapy. Results:
      
    

    
      Annual uptake of CPT increased during most years, reaching a maximum of 11.1%. Annual uptake of PE showed little change until 2008 and then increased, reaching a maximum of 4.4%. The annual prevalence of CPT increased throughout the study, reaching a maximum of 14.6%. The annual prevalence of PE increased to a maximum of 5.0% in 2010, but then flattened and declined. Annual uptake of minimally adequate CPT increased a to maximum of 5% in 2014. Annual uptake of minimally adequate PE increased to a maximum of 1.2% in 2010. The cumulative prevalence of CPT was 19.9% and cumulative prevalence for PE was 7.5%. Conclusions:

Using both codified data and NLP applied to unstructured clinical notes, we first screened pregnant women in Partners HealthCare for suicidal behavior. Psychiatrists manually reviewed clinical charts to identify relevant features for suicidal behavior and to obtain gold-standard labels. Using the adaptive elastic net, we developed algorithms to classify suicidal behavior. We then validated algorithms in an independent validation dataset. From 275,843 women with codes related to pregnancy or delivery, 9331 women screened positive for suicidal behavior by either codified data (N = 196) or NLP (N = 9,145). Using expert-curated features, our algorithm achieved an area under the curve of 0.83. By setting a positive predictive value comparable to that of diagnostic codes related to suicidal behavior (0.71), we obtained a sensitivity of 0.34, specificity of 0.96, and negative predictive value of 0.83. The algorithm identified 1423 pregnant women with suicidal behavior among 9331 women screened positive. Mining unstructured clinical notes using NLP resulted in a 11-fold increase in the number of pregnant women identified with suicidal behavior, as compared to solely reliance on diagnostic codes.","['1 Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.H.

159,Using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing to Review and Classify the Medical Literature on Cancer Susceptibility Genes,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      The medical literature relevant to germline genetics is growing exponentially. Clinicians need tools that help to monitor and prioritize the literature to understand the clinical implications of pathogenic genetic variants. We developed and evaluated two machine learning models to classify abstracts as relevant to the penetrance-risk of cancer for germline mutation carriers-or prevalence of germline genetic mutations. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      We conducted literature searches in PubMed and retrieved paper titles and abstracts to create an annotated data set for training and evaluating the two machine learning classification models. Our first model is a support vector machine (SVM) which learns a linear decision rule on the basis of the bag-of-ngrams representation of each title and abstract. Our second model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) which learns a complex nonlinear decision rule on the basis of the raw title and abstract. We evaluated the performance of the two models on the classification of papers as relevant to penetrance or prevalence. Results:
      
    

    
      For penetrance classification, we annotated 3,740 paper titles and abstracts and evaluated the two models using 10-fold cross-validation. The SVM model achieved 88.93% accuracy-percentage of papers that were correctly classified-whereas the CNN model achieved 88.53% accuracy. For prevalence classification, we annotated 3,753 paper titles and abstracts. The SVM model achieved 88.92% accuracy and the CNN model achieved 88.52% accuracy. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Our models achieve high accuracy in classifying abstracts as relevant to penetrance or prevalence. By facilitating literature review, this tool could help clinicians and researchers keep abreast of the burgeoning knowledge of gene-cancer associations and keep the knowledge bases for clinical decision support tools up to date.","['1 Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston, MA.', '2 Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA.', '3 Harvard T.H.

In addition, we attempted to clarify whether the immune system is involved in this activity. Initially, the LD50 of the venoms from these scorpions were determined and their 0.1 and 0.2 LD50 were calculated. The toxicity of 0.1 and 0.2 LD50 was tested on healthy mice by daily SC administration of these venoms for 12 consecutive days. CT26 cells were inoculated by SC route in BALB/c mice to establish a sold tumor, and ten days later, the mice were treated with 0.1 and 0.2 LD50 doses of the venoms on daily basis for 12 consecutive days. The tumor volume was measured every 4 days. At day 13, the tumors from untreated-control and venom-treated groups were removed, weighed, and assessed by histopathological and immunohistochemical techniques. In addition, the levels of mRNA expression of IL-12, IFN-γ and IL-1β were measured by real-time PCR. All the venoms induced anticancer effects as evidenced by significant inhibition in tumor growth; significant increases in inflammatory and CD+-T cells and expression of mRNA IL-12 and IFN-γ in tumor microenvironment of venom-treated as compared to untreated-control. These findings demonstrated, for the first time, that sub-lethal doses of the venoms from these scorpions induce their in vivo anticancer effects by stimulating the immune system.

164,Natural language processing and machine learning to identify alcohol misuse from the electronic health record in trauma patients: development and internal validation,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Alcohol misuse is present in over a quarter of trauma patients. Information in the clinical notes of the electronic health record of trauma patients may be used for phenotyping tasks with natural language processing (NLP) and supervised machine learning. The objective of this study is to train and validate an NLP classifier for identifying patients with alcohol misuse. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      An observational cohort of 1422 adult patients admitted to a trauma center between April 2013 and November 2016. Linguistic processing of clinical notes was performed using the clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System. The primary analysis was the binary classification of alcohol misuse. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test served as the reference standard. Results:
      
    

    
      The data corpus comprised 91 045 electronic health record notes and 16 091 features. In the final machine learning classifier, 16 features were selected from the first 24 hours of notes for identifying alcohol misuse. The classifier's performance in the validation cohort had an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.78 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72 to 0.85). Sensitivity and specificity were at 56.0% (95% CI, 44.1% to 68.0%) and 88.9% (95% CI, 84.4% to 92.8%). The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test demonstrates the classifier fits the data well (P = .17). A simpler rule-based keyword approach had a decrease in sensitivity when compared with the NLP classifier from 56.0% to 18.2%. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The NLP classifier has adequate predictive validity for identifying alcohol misuse in trauma centers. External validation is needed before its application to augment screening.","['1 Health Sciences Division, Burn and Shock Trauma Research Institute, Stritch School of Medicine, Loyola University, Maywood, Illinois, USA.', '2 Health Sciences Division, Center for Health Outcomes and Informatics Research, Loyola University, Maywood, Illinois, USA.', '3 Department of Public Health Sciences, Stritch School of Medicine, Loyola University, Maywood, Illinois, USA.', '4 Department\xa0of Computer Science, Loyola University, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', '5 Department of Psychiatry, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', '6 Department of Surgery, Loyola University Medical Center, Maywood, Illinois, USA.']","Majid Afshar, Andrew Phillips, Niranjan Karnik, Jeanne Mueller, Daniel To, Richard Gonzalez, Ron Price, Richard Cooper, Cara Joyce, Dmitriy Dligach, ",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30602031
165,A case-based reasoning framework for early detection and diagnosis of novel coronavirus,"Coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). At the time of conducting this study, it had recorded over 11,301,850 confirmed cases while more than 531,806 have died due to it, with these figures rising daily across the globe. The burden of this highly contagious respiratory disease is that it presents itself in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patterns in those already infected, thereby leading to an exponential rise in the number of contractions of the disease and fatalities. It is, therefore, crucial to expedite the process of early detection and diagnosis of the disease across the world. The case-based reasoning (CBR) model is a compelling paradigm that allows for the utilization of case-specific knowledge previously experienced, concrete problem situations or specific patient cases for solving new cases. This study, therefore, aims to leverage the very rich database of cases of COVID-19 to solve new cases. The approach adopted in this study employs the use of an improved CBR model for state-of-the-art reasoning task in the classification of suspected cases of COVID-19. The CBR model leverages on a novel feature selection and the semantic-based mathematical model proposed in this study for case similarity computation. An initial population of the archive was achieved from 71 (67 adults and 4 pediatrics) cases obtained from the Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology (SIRM) repository. Results obtained revealed that the proposed approach in this study successfully classified suspected cases into their categories with an accuracy of 94.54%. The study found that the proposed model can support physicians to easily diagnose suspected cases of COVID-19 based on their medical records without subjecting the specimen to laboratory tests. As a result, there will be a global minimization of contagion rate occasioned by slow testing and in addition, reduced false-positive rates of diagnosed cases as observed in some parts of the globe.","['1 Department of Computer Science, Ahmadu Bello University Zaria, Nigeria.', '2 School of Computer Science, University of KwaZulu-Natal, King Edward Avenue, Pietermaritzburg Campus, Pietermaritzburg, 3201, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.']","Olaide N Oyelade, Absalom E Ezugwu, ",Informatics in medicine unlocked,2020,COVID-19; Case-based reasoning; Coronavirus; Natural language processing; Ontology.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32835080
166,Mining social networks to improve suicide prevention: A scoping review,"Attention about the risks of online social networks (SNs) has been called upon reports describing their use to express emotional distress and suicidal ideation or plans. On the Internet, cyberbullying, suicide pacts, Internet addiction, and ""extreme"" communities seem to increase suicidal behavior (SB). In this study, the scientific literature about SBs and SNs was narratively reviewed. Some authors focus on detecting at-risk populations through data mining, identification of risks factors, and web activity patterns. Others describe prevention practices on the Internet, such as websites, screening, and applications. Targeted interventions through SNs are also contemplated when suicidal ideation is present. Multiple predictive models should be defined, implemented, tested, and combined in order to deal with the risk of SB through an effective decision support system. This endeavor might require a reorganization of care for SNs users presenting suicidal ideation.","['1 INSERM U888, La Colombière Hospital, Montpellier, France.', '2 Department of Adult Psychiatry, CHRU Nimes, Nimes, France.', '3 Departments of Psychiatry, Media and Internet, and Telecommunication and Networks, University of Montpellier UM, Montpellier, France.', '4 LIRMM UMR 5506, Montpellier, France.', '5 Department of Applied Mathematics and Informatics, Paul-Valery University, Montpellier, France.', '6 Department of Emergency Psychiatry and Post-Acute Care, Montpellier University Hospital, Montpellier, France.', '7 Department of Psychiatry, Fundacion Jimenez Diaz University Hospital, Madrid, Spain.', '8 Department of Psychiatry, University Hospital Rey Juan Carlos, Mostoles, Spain.', '9 Department of Psychiatry, General Hospital of Villalba, Madrid, Spain.', '10 Department of Psychiatry, University Hospital Infanta Elena, Valdemoro, Spain.', '11 Department of Psychiatry, Madrid Autonomous University, Madrid, Spain.', '12 CIBERSAM (Centro de Investigacion en Salud Mental), Carlos III Institute of Health, Madrid, Spain.', '13 Universidad Catolica del Maule, Talca, Chile.']","Jorge Lopez-Castroman, Bilel Moulahi, Jérôme Azé, Sandra Bringay, Julie Deninotti, Sebastien Guillaume, Enrique Baca-Garcia, ",Journal of neuroscience research,2020 Apr,mood disorders; natural language processing; social networks; suicidal behavior.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30809836
167,Mixed deep learning and natural language processing method for fake-food image recognition and standardization to help automated dietary assessment,"Objective:
      
    

    
      The present study tested the combination of an established and a validated food-choice research method (the 'fake food buffet') with a new food-matching technology to automate the data collection and analysis. Design:
      
    

    
      The methodology combines fake-food image recognition using deep learning and food matching and standardization based on natural language processing. The former is specific because it uses a single deep learning network to perform both the segmentation and the classification at the pixel level of the image. To assess its performance, measures based on the standard pixel accuracy and Intersection over Union were applied. Food matching firstly describes each of the recognized food items in the image and then matches the food items with their compositional data, considering both their food names and their descriptors. Results:
      
    

    
      The final accuracy of the deep learning model trained on fake-food images acquired by 124 study participants and providing fifty-five food classes was 92·18 %, while the food matching was performed with a classification accuracy of 93 %. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The present findings are a step towards automating dietary assessment and food-choice research. The methodology outperforms other approaches in pixel accuracy, and since it is the first automatic solution for recognizing the images of fake foods, the results could be used as a baseline for possible future studies. As the approach enables a semi-automatic description of recognized food items (e.g. with respect to FoodEx2), these can be linked to any food composition database that applies the same classification and description system.","['1 1Jožef Stefan International Postgraduate School,Ljubljana,Slovenia.', '2 3Institute of Food,Nutrition and Health (IFNH),ETH Zürich,Zürich,Switzerland.', '3 2Computer Systems Department,Jožef Stefan Institute,Jamova cesta 39,Ljubljana 1000,Slovenia.']","Simon Mezgec, Tome Eftimov, Tamara Bucher, Barbara Koroušić Seljak, ",Public health nutrition,2019 May,Fake food buffet; Food image recognition; Food matching; Food replica; Food standardization.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29623869
168,Use of Natural Language Processing Algorithms to Identify Common Data Elements in Operative Notes for Total Hip Arthroplasty,"Background:
      
    

    
      Manual chart review is labor-intensive and requires specialized knowledge possessed by highly trained medical professionals. Natural language processing (NLP) tools are distinctive in their ability to extract critical information from raw text in electronic health records (EHRs). As a proof of concept for the potential application of this technology, we examined the ability of NLP to correctly identify common elements described by surgeons in operative notes for total hip arthroplasty (THA). Methods:
      
    

    
      We evaluated primary THAs that had been performed at a single academic institution from 2000 to 2015. A training sample of operative reports was randomly selected to develop prototype NLP algorithms, and additional operative reports were randomly selected as the test sample. Three separate algorithms were created with rules aimed at capturing (1) the operative approach, (2) the fixation method, and (3) the bearing surface category. The algorithms were applied to operative notes to evaluate the language used by 29 different surgeons at our center and were applied to EHR data from outside facilities to determine external validity. Accuracy statistics were calculated with use of manual chart review as the gold standard. Results:
      
    

    
      The operative approach algorithm demonstrated an accuracy of 99.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 97.1% to 99.9%). The fixation technique algorithm demonstrated an accuracy of 90.7% (95% CI, 86.8% to 93.8%). The bearing surface algorithm demonstrated an accuracy of 95.8% (95% CI, 92.7% to 97.8%). Additionally, the NLP algorithms applied to operative reports from other institutions yielded comparable performance, demonstrating external validity. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      NLP-enabled algorithms are a promising alternative to the current gold standard of manual chart review for identifying common data elements from orthopaedic operative notes. The present study provides a proof of concept for use of NLP techniques in clinical research studies and registry-development endeavors to reliably extract data of interest in an expeditious and cost-effective manner.","['1 Departments of Orthopedic Surgery (C.C.W., M.E.T., D.J.B., D.G.L., and H.M.-K.) and Health Sciences Research (S.F., Y.W., S.S., W.K.K., and H.M.-K.), Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.']","Cody C Wyles, Meagan E Tibbo, Sunyang Fu, Yanshan Wang, Sunghwan Sohn, Walter K Kremers, Daniel J Berry, David G Lewallen, Hilal Maradit-Kremers, ",The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

169,Applying Natural Language Processing to Evaluate News Media Coverage of Bullying and Cyberbullying,"Bullying events have frequently been the focus of coverage by news media, including news stories about teens whose death from suicide was attributed to cyberbullying. Previous work has shown that news media coverage is influential to readers in areas such as suicide, infectious disease outbreaks, and tobacco use. News media may be an untapped resource to promote bullying prevention messages, though current news media approaches to describing bullying and cyberbullying remain unexplored. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the current state of news media coverage of bullying and cyberbullying. A sample of newspaper articles covering bullying or cyberbullying across regional and national US newspapers from 6 recent years was identified. A content analysis using natural language processing was conducted with the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software program for key variables including affective, social, and cognitive processes. Evaluation included the percentage of words that represented Fear-based reporting such as alarmist words (e.g., epidemic, tragic), as well as words that represent Public Health-oriented messages such as prevention. A total of 463 newspaper articles met inclusion criteria, including 140 cyberbullying articles and 323 bullying articles. Findings indicated that cyberbullying articles scored higher on affective processes such as measures of anxiety (Mdn = 0.34) compared to bullying articles (Mdn = 0.22). A greater number of cyberbullying articles were Fear-based (41.4%) than were bullying articles (19.5%). An equivalent number of cyberbullying articles (50.0%) and bullying articles (49.8%) were Public Health-oriented. Findings may be used to collaborate with journalists toward optimizing prevention-oriented reporting.","['1 Department of Pediatrics, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 2870 University Ave, Suite 200, Mailcode 9010, Madison, WI, 53705, USA. mamoreno@pediatrics.wisc.edu.', '2 Department of Pediatrics, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 2870 University Ave, Suite 200, Mailcode 9010, Madison, WI, 53705, USA.', '3 Faculty of Education, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada.']","Megan A Moreno, Aubrey D Gower, Heather Brittain, Tracy Vaillancourt, ",Prevention science : the official journal of the Society for Prevention Research,2019 Nov,Bullying; Cyberbullying; Journalists; Natural language processing; News media.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31414277

In the context of a deep learning experiment to detect altered mental status in emergency department provider notes, we tested several classifiers on clinical notes in their original form and on their automatically de-identified counterpart. We tested both traditional bag-of-words based machine learning models as well as word-embedding based deep learning models. We evaluated the models on 1,113 history of present illness notes. A total of 1,795 protected health information tokens were replaced in the de-identification process across all notes. The deep learning models had the best performance with accuracies of 95% on both original and de-identified notes. However, there was no significant difference in the performance of any of the models on the original vs. the de-identified notes.","['1 Biomedical Informatics Center, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA.', '2 Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Outcome Sciences, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA.', '3 Department of Emergency Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA.', '4 Department of Computer Science, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, USA.']","Jihad S Obeid, Paul M Heider, Erin R Weeda, Andrew J Matuskowitz, Christine M Carr, Kevin Gagnon, Tami Crawford, Stephane M Meystre, ",Studies in health technology and informatics,2019,Data Anonymization; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31437930

Vaccines have been emerged as an attractive approach for their capacity of eliciting long-term immune response targeting cancer cells. Attenuated avirulent Toxoplasma gondii stimulate immunity and activate antitumor cells thereby eliciting rejection of some established cancer. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antitumor-protective capacity of vaccination with gamma radiation-attenuated T. gondii against ovarian penetration in Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC)-bearing mice.Materials and methods: Forty-five mice were randomly divided into three groups as follows: nontumor-bearing (normal control); EAC-bearing group (EAC); and mice vaccinated orally with gamma radiation-attenuated T. gondii then inoculated 2 weeks later with EAC (TG + EAC). Survival rate, serum interleukin-12 (IL-12), and levels of IFN-γ mRNA, CD4, and CD8 in ovarian tissues homogenate were assessed. Also, ovarian histopathology and immunohistochemical expressions of metalloproteinase-2, CD34, and vimentin were determined.Results: The group vaccinated with attenuated T. gondii showed significantly increased survival rates, serum IL-12, and levels of IFN-γ, CD4, and CD8 in ovarian tissue homogenates as well as an enhancement of histopathological and immunohistochemical changes compared to EAC-bearing group.Conclusion: Vaccination with gamma radiation-attenuated T. gondii has the capacity to supply immunoprotective impact against ovarian invasion in EAC-bearing mice.","['1 Health Radiation Research Department, National Center for Radiation Research and Technology (NCRRT), Egyptian Atomic Energy Authority, Cairo, Egypt.']","Eman N Hafez, Hanan M G Youssef, Hanan A El-Kabany, ",International journal of radiation biology,2020 Jun,Ehrlich ascites carcinoma; Toxoplasma gondii; gamma radiation; immunohistochemistry; ovary.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32149560
172,Active deep learning to detect demographic traits in free-form clinical notes,"The free-form portions of clinical notes are a significant source of information for research, but before they can be used, they must be de-identified to protect patients' privacy. De-identification efforts have focused on known identifier types (names, ages, dates, addresses, ID's, etc.). However, a note can contain residual ""Demographic Traits"" (DTs), unique enough to re-identify the patient when combined with other such facts. Here we examine whether any residual risks remain after removing these identifiers. After manually annotating over 140,000 words worth of medical notes, we found no remaining directly identifying information, and a low prevalence of demographic traits, such as marital status or housing type. We developed an annotation guide to the discovered Demographic Traits (DTs) and used it to label MIMIC-III and i2b2-2006 clinical notes as test sets. We then designed a ""bootstrapped"" active learning iterative process for identifying DTs: we tentatively labeled as positive all sentences in the DT-rich note sections, used these to train a binary classifier, manually corrected acute errors, and retrained the classifier. This train-and-correct process may be iterated. Our active learning process significantly improved the classifier's accuracy. Moreover, our BERT-based model outperformed non-neural models when trained on both tentatively labeled data and manually relabeled examples. To facilitate future research and benchmarking, we also produced and made publicly available our human annotated DT-tagged datasets. We conclude that directly identifying information is virtually non-existent in the multiple medical note types we investigated. Demographic traits are present in medical notes, but can be detected with high accuracy using a cost-effective human-in-the-loop active learning process, and redacted if desired.2.","['1 Google and Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, Tel Aviv, Israel.

      Recent reports of some studies have described that the cognitive function of cancer patients often declines by a phenomenon designated as cancer related cognitive impairment (CRCI). For patients' decision-making, detecting CRCI is important. To do so, this study uses language-based CRCI screening to examine participants' language ability. Objective:
      
    

    
      This study was conducted to ascertain whether a Natural Language Processing (NLP) based system can detect CRCI, or not. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      We obtained materials of two types from cancer patients (n = 116): (1) speech samples on three topics, and (2) cognitive function level test scores from Hasegawa's Dementia Scale - Revised (HDS-R), a test used in Japan for dementia patients. The test is similar to the Mini-Mental State Examination. Results and discussion:

176,Natural language processing for populating lung cancer clinical research data,"Background:
      
    

    
      Lung cancer is the second most common cancer for men and women; the wide adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) offers a potential to accelerate cohort-related epidemiological studies using informatics approaches.

177,Partial absence of PD-1 expression by tumor-infiltrating EBV-specific CD8 + T cells in EBV-driven lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma,"Objectives:
      
    

    
      Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (LELC) is an uncommon lung cancer, typically observed in young, non-smoking Asian populations. LELC is associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection of lung tumor cells of epithelial origin, suggesting a carcinogenic role of EBV as observed in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Here, we studied the antigen specificity and phenotype of EBV-specific CD8+ T cells in blood and tumor of one LELC patient positive for EBV infection in lung tumor cells. Methods:
      
    

    
      Using multiplex MHC class I tetramers, mass cytometry and mRNA sequencing, we studied EBV-specific CD8+ T cells at the transcriptomic and phenotypic levels in blood and tumor tissues of the LELC patient. Results:
      
    

    
      Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma lung tumor cells were positive for EBV infection. In both blood and tumor tissues, we detected two populations of EBV-specific CD8+ T cells targeting the EBV lytic cycle proteins: BRLF1 and BMLF1. Transcriptomic analyses of these two populations in the tumor, which can be considered as tumor-specific, revealed their distinct exhausted profile and polyclonal TCR repertoire. High-dimensional phenotypical analysis revealed the distinct phenotype of these cells between blood and tumor tissues. In tumor tissue, EBV-specific CD8+ TILs were phenotypically heterogeneous, but consistently expressed CD39. Unexpectedly, although the LELC tumor cells expressed abundant PD-L1, these tumor-specific CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) mostly did not express PD-1. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Epstein-Barr virus-specific CD8+ TILs in EBV-driven tumor are heterogeneous and partially lack PD-1 expression, suggesting that anti-PD1/PD-L1 immunotherapy may not be an appropriate strategy for disinhibiting EBV-specific cells in the treatment of LELC patients.","['1 Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center Seattle WA USA.', '2 Agency for Science, Technology and Research Singapore (ASTAR) Singapore Immunology Network (SIgN) Singapore.', '3 ImmunoScape Pte Ltd Singapore.', '4 Department of Anatomical Pathology Singapore General Hospital Singapore General Hospital Singapore.', '5 Division of Medical Oncology National Cancer Centre Singapore (NCCS) Singapore.', '6 Agency for Science, Technology and Research (ASTAR) Genome Institute of Singapore (GIS) Singapore.', '7 Senior Corresponding Author.']","Yannick Simoni, Etienne Becht, Shamin Li, Chiew Yee Loh, Joe Poh Sheng Yeong, Tony Kiat Hon Lim, Angela Takano, Daniel Shao Weng Tan, Evan W Newell, ",Clinical & translational immunology,2020,CD39; CD8; EBV; LELC; PD‐1; cancer; lymphoepithelioma‐like carcinoma; tetramer; tumor.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32995000
178,Natural language processing and machine learning algorithm to identify brain MRI reports with acute ischemic stroke,"Background and purpose:
      
    

    
      This project assessed performance of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) algorithms for classification of brain MRI radiology reports into acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and non-AIS phenotypes. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      All brain MRI reports from a single academic institution over a two year period were randomly divided into 2 groups for ML: training (70%) and testing (30%). Using ""quanteda"" NLP package, all text data were parsed into tokens to create the data frequency matrix. Ten-fold cross-validation was applied for bias correction of the training set. Labeling for AIS was performed manually, identifying clinical notes. We applied binary logistic regression, naïve Bayesian classification, single decision tree, and support vector machine for the binary classifiers, and we assessed performance of the algorithms by F1-measure. We also assessed how n-grams or term frequency-inverse document frequency weighting affected the performance of the algorithms. Results:
      
    

    
      Of all 3,204 brain MRI documents, 432 (14.3%) were labeled as AIS. AIS documents were longer in character length than those of non-AIS (median [interquartile range]; 551 [377-681] vs. 309 [164-396]). Of all ML algorithms, single decision tree had the highest F1-measure (93.2) and accuracy (98.0%). Adding bigrams to the ML model improved F1-mesaure of naïve Bayesian classification, but not in others, and term frequency-inverse document frequency weighting to data frequency matrix did not show any additional performance improvements. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Supervised ML based NLP algorithms are useful for automatic classification of brain MRI reports for identification of AIS patients. Single decision tree was the best classifier to identify brain MRI reports with AIS.","['1 Department of Neurology, Hallym University College of Medicine, Chuncheon, Korea.', '2 Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, United States of America.', '3 Biomedical Informatics Center, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, United States of America.', '4 Department of Internal Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, United States of America.']","Chulho Kim, Vivienne Zhu, Jihad Obeid, Leslie Lenert, ",PloS one,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30818342
179,Toward a Model for Personal Health Record Interoperability,"Health information technology, applied to electronic health record (EHR), has evolved with the adoption of standards for defining patient health records. However, there are many standards for defining such data, hindering communication between different healthcare providers. Even with adopted standards, patients often need to repeatedly provide their health information when they are taken care of at different locations. This problem hinders the adoption of personal health record (PHR), with the patients' health records under their own control. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to propose an interoperability model for PHR use. The methodology consisted prototyping an application model named OmniPHR, to evaluate the structuring of semantic interoperability and integration of different health standards, using a real database from anonymized patients. We evaluated health data from a hospital database with 38 645 adult patients' medical records processed using different standards, represented by openEHR, HL7 FHIR, and MIMIC-III reference models. OmniPHR demonstrated the feasibility to provide interoperability through a standard ontology and artificial intelligence with natural language processing (NLP). Although the first executions reached a 76.39% F1-score and required retraining of the machine-learning process, the final score was 87.9%, presenting a way to obtain the original data from different standards on a single format. Unlike other models, OmniPHR presents a unified, structural semantic and up-to-date vision of PHR for patients and healthcare providers. The results were promising and demonstrated the possibility of subsidizing the creation of inferences rules about possible patient health problems or preventing future problems.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Alex Roehrs, Cristiano Andre da Costa, Rodrigo da Rosa Righi, Sandro Jose Rigo, Matheus Henrique Wichman, ",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,2019 Mar,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29993759
180,Machine Learning in Relation to Emergency Medicine Clinical and Operational Scenarios: An Overview,"Health informatics is a vital technology that holds great promise in the healthcare setting. We describe two prominent health informatics tools relevant to emergency care, as well as the historical background and the current state of informatics. We also identify recent research findings and practice changes. The recent advances in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) are a prominent development in health informatics overall and relevant in emergency medicine (EM). A basic comprehension of machine-learning algorithms is the key to understand the recent usage of artificial intelligence in healthcare. We are using NLP more in clinical use for documentation. NLP has started to be used in research to identify clinically important diseases and conditions. Health informatics has the potential to benefit both healthcare providers and patients. We cover two powerful tools from health informatics for EM clinicians and researchers by describing the previous successes and challenges and conclude with their implications to emergency care.","['1 University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Department of Emergency Medicine, Iowa City, Iowa.', '2 University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Department of Emergency Medicine, Anesthesia and Critical Care, Iowa City, Iowa.', '3 University of Iowa Tippie College of Business, Department of Management Sciences, Iowa City, Iowa.', '4 University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Iowa City, Iowa.']","Sangil Lee, Nicholas M Mohr, W Nicholas Street, Prakash Nadkarni, ",The western journal of emergency medicine,2019 Mar,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30881539
181,Clinical Annotation Research Kit (CLARK): Computable Phenotyping Using Machine Learning,"Computable phenotypes are algorithms that translate clinical features into code that can be run against electronic health record (EHR) data to define patient cohorts. However, computable phenotypes that only make use of structured EHR data do not capture the full richness of a patient's medical record. While natural language processing (NLP) methods have shown success in extracting clinical features from text, the use of such tools has generally been limited to research groups with substantial NLP expertise. Our goal was to develop an open-source phenotyping software, Clinical Annotation Research Kit (CLARK), that would enable clinical and translational researchers to use machine learning-based NLP for computable phenotyping without requiring deep informatics expertise. CLARK enables nonexpert users to mine text using machine learning classifiers by specifying features for the software to match in clinical notes. Once the features are defined, the user-friendly CLARK interface allows the user to choose from a variety of standard machine learning algorithms (linear support vector machine, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, decision tree, and random forest), cross-validation methods, and the number of folds (cross-validation splits) to be used in evaluation of the classifier. Example phenotypes where CLARK has been applied include pediatric diabetes (sensitivity=0.91; specificity=0.98), symptomatic uterine fibroids (positive predictive value=0.81; negative predictive value=0.54), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (sensitivity=0.90; specificity=0.94), and primary ciliary dyskinesia (sensitivity=0.88; specificity=1.0). In each of these use cases, CLARK allowed investigators to incorporate variables into their phenotype algorithm that would not be available as structured data. Moreover, the fact that nonexpert users can get started with machine learning-based NLP with limited informatics involvement is a significant improvement over the status quo. We hope to disseminate CLARK to other organizations that may not have NLP or machine learning specialists available, enabling wider use of these methods.","['1 North Carolina Translational and Clinical Sciences Institute, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, United States.', '2 CoVar Applied Technologies, Durham, NC, United States.', '3 Renaissance Computing Institute, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, United States.']","Emily R Pfaff, Miles Crosskey, Kenneth Morton, Ashok Krishnamurthy, ",JMIR medical informatics,2020,electronic health records; machine learning; natural language processing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32012059
182,Identification of SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Epitopes Predicted to Induce Long-Term Population-Scale Immunity,"Here we propose a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine design concept based on identification of highly conserved regions of the viral genome and newly acquired adaptations, both predicted to generate epitopes presented on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II across the vast majority of the population. We further prioritize genomic regions that generate highly dissimilar peptides from the human proteome and are also predicted to produce B cell epitopes. We propose sixty-five 33-mer peptide sequences, a subset of which can be tested using DNA or mRNA delivery strategies. These include peptides that are contained within evolutionarily divergent regions of the spike protein reported to increase infectivity through increased binding to the ACE2 receptor and within a newly evolved furin cleavage site thought to increase membrane fusion. Validation and implementation of this vaccine concept could specifically target specific vulnerabilities of SARS-CoV-2 and should engage a robust adaptive immune response in the vast majority of the population.","[""1 Division of Oncology and Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."", ""2 Department of Biomedical and Health Informatics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."", '3 Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']","Mark Yarmarkovich, John M Warrington, Alvin Farrel, John M Maris, ",Cell reports.

184,CD133 mRNA-Loaded Dendritic Cell Vaccination Abrogates Glioma Stem Cell Propagation in Humanized Glioblastoma Mouse Model,"Cancer stem cells are initiating cells of cancer and propagate its growth through self-renewal and differentiation of its daughter cells. CD133 is a cell surface antigen that is present on glioma stem cells and has been used to prospectively isolate glioma stem cells. We hypothesized that a major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-independent and long-lasting immune response against CD133 could be generated by transfecting CD133 mRNA into dendritic cells and vaccinating animals with experimental gliomas. To test this hypothesis, we developed a novel humanized mouse model using CD34-positive hematopoietic stem cells. We confirmed the robust simultaneous activation of CD8- and CD4-positive T cells by dendritic cell vaccination with modified CD133 mRNA leading to a potent and long-lived immune response, with subsequent abrogation of CD133-positive glioma stem cell propagation and tumor growth. This study for the first time demonstrates in both a humanized mouse model and in a syngeneic mouse model of glioblastoma that targeting a glioma stem cell-associated antigen is an effective strategy to target and kill glioma stem cells. This novel and simple humanized mouse model for immunotherapy is a significant advance in our ability to test human-specific immunotherapies for glioblastoma.","['1 Department of Neurosurgery, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', '2 Department of Immunopathology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA.']","Angelique Sao-Mai Sy Do, Takayuki Amano, Lincoln A Edwards, Lei Zhang, Mariza De Peralta-Venturina, John S Yu, ",Molecular therapy oncolytics,2020,CD133; GBM; dendritic cell vaccine; humanized mouse model.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32728617
185,Open Agile text mining for bioinformatics: the PubAnnotation ecosystem,"Motivation:
      
    

    
      Most currently available text mining tools share two characteristics that make them less than optimal for use by biomedical researchers: they require extensive specialist skills in natural language processing and they were built on the assumption that they should optimize global performance metrics on representative datasets. This is a problem because most end-users are not natural language processing specialists and because biomedical researchers often care less about global metrics like F-measure or representative datasets than they do about more granular metrics such as precision and recall on their own specialized datasets. Thus, there are fundamental mismatches between the assumptions of much text mining work and the preferences of potential end-users. Results:
      
    

    
      This article introduces the concept of Agile text mining, and presents the PubAnnotation ecosystem as an example implementation. The system approaches the problems from two perspectives: it allows the reformulation of text mining by biomedical researchers from the task of assembling a complete system to the task of retrieving warehoused annotations, and it makes it possible to do very targeted customization of the pre-existing system to address specific end-user requirements. Two use cases are presented: assisted curation of the GlycoEpitope database, and assessing coverage in the literature of pre-eclampsia-associated genes. Availability and implementation:
      
    

    
      The three tools that make up the ecosystem, PubAnnotation, PubDictionaries and TextAE are publicly available as web services, and also as open source projects. The dictionaries and the annotation datasets associated with the use cases are all publicly available through PubDictionaries and PubAnnotation, respectively.","['1 Database Center for Life Science, Research Organization of Information and Systems, Kashiwa, Chiba, Japan.', '2 Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Niigata University, Niigata, Japan.', '3 Computational Bioscience Program, University of Colorado Denver, Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA.', '4 Université Paris-Saclay, LIMSI-ILES, France.']","Jin-Dong Kim, Yue Wang, Toyofumi Fujiwara, Shujiro Okuda, Tiffany J Callahan, K Bretonnel Cohen, ","Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30937439
186,A Framework for Applying Natural Language Processing in Digital Health Interventions,"Background:
      
    

    
      Digital health interventions (DHIs) are poised to reduce target symptoms in a scalable, affordable, and empirically supported way. DHIs that involve coaching or clinical support often collect text data from 2 sources: (1) open correspondence between users and the trained practitioners supporting them through a messaging system and (2) text data recorded during the intervention by users, such as diary entries. Natural language processing (NLP) offers methods for analyzing text, augmenting the understanding of intervention effects, and informing therapeutic decision making. Objective:
      
    

    
      This study aimed to present a technical framework that supports the automated analysis of both types of text data often present in DHIs. This framework generates text features and helps to build statistical models to predict target variables, including user engagement, symptom change, and therapeutic outcomes. Methods:
      
    

    
      We first discussed various NLP techniques and demonstrated how they are implemented in the presented framework. We then applied the framework in a case study of the Healthy Body Image Program, a Web-based intervention trial for eating disorders (EDs). A total of 372 participants who screened positive for an ED received a DHI aimed at reducing ED psychopathology (including binge eating and purging behaviors) and improving body image. These users generated 37,228 intervention text snippets and exchanged 4285 user-coach messages, which were analyzed using the proposed model. Results:
      
    

    
      We applied the framework to predict binge eating behavior, resulting in an area under the curve between 0.57 (when applied to new users) and 0.72 (when applied to new symptom reports of known users). In addition, initial evidence indicated that specific text features predicted the therapeutic outcome of reducing ED symptoms. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The case study demonstrates the usefulness of a structured approach to text data analytics. NLP techniques improve the prediction of symptom changes in DHIs. We present a technical framework that can be easily applied in other clinical trials and clinical presentations and encourage other groups to apply the framework in similar contexts.","['1 Leuphana University, Institute of Information Systems, Lueneburg, Germany.', '2 Palo Alto University, Center for m2Health, Palo Alto, CA, United States.', '3 Stanford University, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford, CA, United States.', '4 Washington University in St Louis, Department of Psychiatry, St Louis, MO, United States.', '5 University at Buffalo, Department of Exercise and Nutrition Sciences, Buffalo, NY, United States.', '6 University of California San Diego, Department of Pediatrics, San Diego, CA, United States.', '7 University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Department of Psychology and Neurosciences, Chapel Hill, NC, United States.', '8 Technische Universität, Institute of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy, Dresden, Germany.', '9 Northwestern University, Department of Medical Social Sciences, Chicago, IL, United States.', '10 Vrije Universiteit, Department of Computer Science, Amsterdam, Netherlands.']","Burkhardt Funk, Shiri Sadeh-Sharvit, Ellen E Fitzsimmons-Craft, Mickey Todd Trockel, Grace E Monterubio, Neha J Goel, Katherine N Balantekin, Dawn M Eichen, Rachael E Flatt, Marie-Laure Firebaugh, Corinna Jacobi, Andrea K Graham, Mark Hoogendoorn, Denise E Wilfley, C Barr Taylor, ",Journal of medical Internet research,2020,Digital Health Interventions Text Analytics (DHITA); digital health interventions; eating disorders; guided self-help; natural language processing; text mining.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32130118
187,Text Mining in Electronic Medical Records Enables Quick and Efficient Identification of Pregnancy Cases Occurring After Breast Cancer,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      To apply text mining (TM) technology on electronic medical records (EMRs) of patients with breast cancer (BC) to retrieve the occurrence of a pregnancy after BC diagnosis and compare its performance to manual curation. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      The training cohort (Cohort A) comprised 344 patients with BC age ≤ 40 years old treated at Institut Curie between 2005 and 2007. Manual curation consisted in manually reviewing each EMR to retrieve pregnancies. TM consisted of first applying a keyword filter (""accouch*"" or ""enceinte,"" French terms for ""deliver*"" and ""pregnant,"" respectively) to select a subset of EMRs, and, second, checking manually EMRs to confirm the pregnancy. Then, we applied our TM algorithm on an independent cohort of patients with BC treated between 2008 and 2012 (Cohort B). Results:
      
    

    
      In Cohort A, 36 pregnancies were identified among 344 patients (10.5%; 2,829 person-years of EMR). Thirty were identified by manual review versus 35 by TM. TM resulted in a lower percentage of manual checking (26.7% v 100%, respectively) and substantial time gains (time to identify a pregnancy: 13 minutes for TM v 244 minutes for manual curation, respectively). Presence of any of the two TM filters showed excellent sensitivity (97%) and negative predictive value (100%). In Cohort B, 67 pregnancies were identified among 1,226 patients (5.5%; 7,349 person-years of EMR). Similarly, for Cohort B, TM spared 904 (73.7%) EMRs from manual review and quickly generated a cohort of 67 pregnancies after BC. Incidence rate of pregnancy after BC was 0.01 pregnancy per person-year of EMR in both cohorts. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      TM is highly efficient to quickly identify rare events and is a promising tool to improve rapidity, efficiency, and costs of medical research.","['1 Institut Curie, Paris, France.', '2 Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland.', '3 Port-Royal Maternity Unit, Paris, France.', '4 Cancerology Institute, Montpellier, France.', '5 Institut Curie, U900, Hôpital René Huguenin, Saint-Cloud, France.', '6 Paris 5 Research University, INSERM U932, Institut Curie, Paris, France.']","Julie Labrosse, Thanh Lam, Clara Sebbag, Milena Benque, Ines Abdennebi, Hilde Merckelbagh, Marie Osdoit, Maël Priour, Julien Guerin, Thomas Balezeau, Beatriz Grandal, Florence Coussy, Angélique Bobrie, Loïc Ferrer, Enora Laas, Jean-Guillaume Feron, Fabien Reyal, Anne-Sophie Hamy, ",JCO clinical cancer informatics,2019 Oct,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31626565
188,"Translating cancer genomics into precision medicine with artificial intelligence: applications, challenges and future perspectives","In the field of cancer genomics, the broad availability of genetic information offered by next-generation sequencing technologies and rapid growth in biomedical publication has led to the advent of the big-data era. Integration of artificial intelligence (AI) approaches such as machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP) to tackle the challenges of scalability and high dimensionality of data and to transform big data into clinically actionable knowledge is expanding and becoming the foundation of precision medicine. In this paper, we review the current status and future directions of AI application in cancer genomics within the context of workflows to integrate genomic analysis for precision cancer care. The existing solutions of AI and their limitations in cancer genetic testing and diagnostics such as variant calling and interpretation are critically analyzed. Publicly available tools or algorithms for key NLP technologies in the literature mining for evidence-based clinical recommendations are reviewed and compared. In addition, the present paper highlights the challenges to AI adoption in digital healthcare with regard to data requirements, algorithmic transparency, reproducibility, and real-world assessment, and discusses the importance of preparing patients and physicians for modern digitized healthcare. We believe that AI will remain the main driver to healthcare transformation toward precision medicine, yet the unprecedented challenges posed should be addressed to ensure safety and beneficial impact to healthcare.","['1 IBM Watson Health, Cambridge, MA, USA. xujia@us.ibm.com.', '2 IBM Watson Health, Cambridge, MA, USA.']","Jia Xu, Pengwei Yang, Shang Xue, Bhuvan Sharma, Marta Sanchez-Martin, Fang Wang, Kirk A Beaty, Elinor Dehan, Baiju Parikh, ",Human genetics,2019 Feb,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30671672

In a phase I/IIa dose-escalation trial, 46 patients with locally advanced (n = 7) or metastatic (n = 39) NSCLC and at least stable disease after first-line treatment received five intradermal CV9201 injections (400-1600 µg of mRNA). The primary objective of the trial was to assess safety. Secondary objectives included assessment of antibody and ex vivo T cell responses against the five antigens, and changes in immune cell populations. All CV9201 dose levels were well-tolerated and the recommended dose for phase IIa was 1600 µg. Most AEs were mild-to-moderate injection site reactions and flu-like symptoms. Three (7%) patients had grade 3 related AEs. No related grade 4/5 or related serious AEs occurred. In phase IIa, antigen-specific immune responses against ≥ 1 antigen were detected in 63% of evaluable patients after treatment.

190,Blood Eosinophilia is an on-Treatment Biomarker in Patients with Solid Tumors Undergoing Dendritic Cell Vaccination with Autologous Tumor-RNA,"Background:
      
    

    
      The approvals of immune checkpoint inhibitors for several cancer types and the rapidly growing recognition that T cell-based immunotherapy significantly improves outcomes for cancer patients led to a re-emergence of cancer vaccines, including dendritic cell (DC)-based immunotherapy. Blood and tissue biomarkers to identify responders and long-term survivors and to optimize cost and cost-effectiveness of treatment are greatly needed. We wanted to investigate whether blood eosinophilia is a predictive biomarker for patients with solid tumors receiving vaccinations with DCs loaded with autologous tumor-RNA. Methods:
      
    

    
      In total, 67 patients with metastatic solid tumors, who we treated with autologous monocyte-derived DCs transfected with total tumor mRNA, were serially analyzed for eosinophil counts and survival over the course of up to 14 years. Eosinophilic counts were performed on peripheral blood smears. Results:
      
    

    
      Up to 87% of the patients treated with DC-based immunotherapy experienced at least once an eosinophilia of ≥ 5% after initiation of therapy; 61 % reached levels of ≥ 10% eosinophils, and 13% of patients showed eosinophil counts of 20% or above. While prevaccination eosinophil levels were not associated with survival, patients with blood eosinophilia at any point after initiation of DC-based immunotherapy showed a trend towards longer survival. There was a statistically significant difference for the patients with eosinophil counts of 20% or more (p = 0.03). In those patients, survival was prolonged to a median of 58 months (range 2-111 months), compared to a median of 20 months (range 0-119 months) in patients with lower eosinophil counts. In 12% of the patients, an immediate increase in eosinophil count of at least 10 percentage points could be detected after the first vaccine, which also appeared to correlate with survival (65 vs. 24 months; p = 0.06). Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Blood eosinophilia appears to be an early, on-therapy biomarker in patients with solid tumors undergoing vaccination with RNA-transfected DC, specifically autologous tumor mRNA-transfected DC vaccines, and it correlates with long-term patient outcome. Eosinophilia should be systematically investigated in future trials.","['1 Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU), Erlangen 91054, Germany.']","Alvaro Moreira, Michael Erdmann, Ugur Uslu, Verona Vass, Gerold Schuler, Beatrice Schuler-Thurner, ",Pharmaceutics,2020,biomarkers; dendritic cell vaccines; eosinophils.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32121531
191,Leveraging mRNA Sequences and Nanoparticles to Deliver SARS-CoV-2 Antigens In Vivo,"SARS-CoV-2 has become a pandemic worldwide; therefore, an effective vaccine is urgently needed. Recently, messenger RNAs (mRNAs) have emerged as a promising platform for vaccination. In this work, the untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs are systematically engineered in order to enhance protein production. Through a comprehensive analysis of endogenous gene expression and de novo design of UTRs, the optimal combination of 5' and 3' UTR are identified and termed NASAR, which are 5- to 10-fold more efficient than the tested endogenous UTRs. More importantly, NASAR mRNAs delivered by lipid-derived TT3 nanoparticles trigger a dramatic expression of potential SARS-CoV-2 antigens. The antigen-specific antibodies induced by TT3-nanoparticles and NASAR mRNAs are over two orders of magnitude more than that induced by the FDA-approved lipid nanoparticle material MC3 in vaccinated mice. These NASAR mRNAs merit further development as alternative SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.","['1 Division of Pharmaceutics & Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, 43210, USA.', '2 Department of Biomedical Engineering, Center for Clinical and Translational Science, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Dorothy M.

193,Primal world beliefs,"Beck's insight-that beliefs about one's self, future, and environment shape behavior-transformed depression treatment. Yet environment beliefs remain relatively understudied. We introduce a set of environment beliefs-primal world beliefs or primals-that concern the world's overall character (e.g., the world is interesting, the world is dangerous). To create a measure, we systematically identified candidate primals (e.g., analyzing tweets, historical texts, etc.); conducted exploratory factor analysis (N = 930) and two confirmatory factor analyses (N = 524; N = 529); examined sequence effects (N = 219) and concurrent validity (N = 122); and conducted test-retests over 2 weeks (n = 122), 9 months (n = 134), and 19 months (n = 398). The resulting 99-item Primals Inventory (PI-99) measures 26 primals with three overarching beliefs-Safe, Enticing, and Alive (mean α = .93)-that typically explain ∼55% of the common variance. These beliefs were normally distributed; stable (2 weeks, 9 months, and 19 month test-retest results averaged .88, .75, and .77, respectively); strongly correlated with many personality and wellbeing variables (e.g., Safe and optimism, r = .61; Enticing and depression, r = -.52; Alive and meaning, r = .54); and explained more variance in life satisfaction, transcendent experience, trust, and gratitude than the BIG 5 (3%, 3%, 6%, and 12% more variance, respectively). In sum, the PI-99 showed strong psychometric characteristics, primals plausibly shape many personality and wellbeing variables, and a broad research effort examining these relationships is warranted.

194,Opportunities and Challenges in the Delivery of mRNA-based Vaccines,"In the past few years, there has been increasing focus on the use of messenger RNA (mRNA) as a new therapeutic modality. Current clinical efforts encompassing mRNA-based drugs are directed toward infectious disease vaccines, cancer immunotherapies, therapeutic protein replacement therapies, and treatment of genetic diseases. However, challenges that impede the successful translation of these molecules into drugs are that (i) mRNA is a very large molecule, (ii) it is intrinsically unstable and prone to degradation by nucleases, and (iii) it activates the immune system. Although some of these challenges have been partially solved by means of chemical modification of the mRNA, intracellular delivery of mRNA still represents a major hurdle. The clinical translation of mRNA-based therapeutics requires delivery technologies that can ensure stabilization of mRNA under physiological conditions. Here, we (i) review opportunities and challenges in the delivery of mRNA-based therapeutics with a focus on non-viral delivery systems, (ii) present the clinical status of mRNA vaccines, and (iii) highlight perspectives on the future of this promising new type of medicine.","['1 Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Universitetsparken 2, DK-2100 Copenhagen Ø, Denmark.']","Abishek Wadhwa, Anas Aljabbari, Abhijeet Lokras, Camilla Foged, Aneesh Thakur, ",Pharmaceutics,2020,drug delivery systems; lipids; mRNA; nanomedicine; nanoparticles; polymers; prophylactic; therapeutic; vaccines.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32013049
195,Ensuring the spread of referral marketing campaigns: a quantitative treatment,"In marketing world, social media is playing a crucial role nowadays. One of the most recent strategies that exploit social contacts for the purpose of marketing, is referral marketing, where a person shares information related to a particular product among his/her social contacts. When this spreading of marketing information goes viral, the diffusion process looks like an epidemic spread. In this work, we perform a systematic study with a goal to device a methodology for using the huge amount of survey data available to understand customer behaviour from a more mathematical and quantitative perspective. We perform an unsupervised natural language processing and hierarchical clustering based analysis of the responses of a recent survey focused on referral marketing to correlate the customers' psychology with transitional dynamics, and investigate some major determinants that regulate the diffusion of a campaign. In addition to natural language processing for topic modeling, detailed differential equation based analysis and graph theoretical treatment have been carried out to explore the conditions of success for the campaign in terms of realistic parameters both for homogeneous and heterogeneous population structure. Finally, experiments have been performed for generation of a recommendation network to understand the diffusion dynamics in realistic scenario. A complete mathematical treatment with analysis over real social networks helped us to determine key customer motivations and their impacts on a marketing strategy, which are important to ensure an effective spread of a designed marketing campaign. Because of its systematic generalized formulation, the prescribed quantitative framework may be useful in all areas of social dynamics, beyond the field of marketing.","['1 National Institute of Technology Durgapur, Durgapur, India. sayantari.ghosh@phy.nitdgp.ac.in.', '2 Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, Kanpur, India.', '3 Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, Kharagpur, India.']","Sayantari Ghosh, Kumar Gaurav, Saumik Bhattacharya, Yatindra Nath Singh, ",Scientific reports,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32632242

Yet, to make the most of this opportunity, decision-makers must understand AI concepts. In this article, we describe approaches and fields within AI and illustrate through examples how they can contribute to informed decisions, with a focus on population health applications. We first introduce core concepts needed to understand modern uses of AI and then describe its sub-fields. Finally, we examine four sub-fields of AI most relevant to population health along with examples of available tools and frameworks. Artificial intelligence is a broad and complex field, but the tools that enable the use of AI techniques are becoming more accessible, less expensive, and easier to use than ever before. Applications of AI have the potential to assist clinicians, health system managers, policy-makers, and public health practitioners in making more precise, and potentially more effective, decisions.","['1 1 Surveillance Lab, McGill Clinical and Health Informatics, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', '2 2 Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Occupational Health, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', '3 3 CIHR Institute of Population and Public Health, Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', '4 4 Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', '5 5 Global Strategy Lab, York University, Toronto, Canada.', '6 6 Dahdaleh Institute for Global Health Research, Faculty of Health and Osgoode Hall Law School, York University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']","Maxime Lavigne, Fatima Mussa, Maria I Creatore, Steven J Hoffman, David L Buckeridge, ",Healthcare management forum,2019 Jul,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31106580
197,"Semantic measures: Using natural language processing to measure, differentiate, and describe psychological constructs","Psychological constructs, such as emotions, thoughts, and attitudes are often measured by asking individuals to reply to questions using closed-ended numerical rating scales. However, when asking people about their state of mind in a natural context (""How are you?""), we receive open-ended answers using words (""Fine and happy!"") and not closed-ended answers using numbers (""7"") or categories (""A lot""). Nevertheless, to date it has been difficult to objectively quantify responses to open-ended questions. We develop an approach using open-ended questions in which the responses are analyzed using natural language processing (Latent Semantic Analyses). This approach of using open-ended, semantic questions is compared with traditional rating scales in nine studies (N = 92-854), including two different study paradigms. The first paradigm requires participants to describe psychological aspects of external stimuli (facial expressions) and the second paradigm involves asking participants to report their subjective well-being and mental health problems. The results demonstrate that the approach using semantic questions yields good statistical properties with competitive, or higher, validity and reliability compared with corresponding numerical rating scales. As these semantic measures are based on natural language and measure, differentiate, and describe psychological constructs, they have the potential of complementing and extending traditional rating scales.

      To demonstrate the utility of a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm for mining kidney stone composition in a large-scale electronic health records (EHR) repository. Methods:
      
    

    
      We developed StoneX, a pattern-matching method for extracting kidney stone composition information from clinical notes. We trained the extraction algorithm on manually annotated text mentions of calcium oxalate monohydrate, calcium oxalate dihydrate, hydroxyapatite, brushite, uric acid, and struvite stones. We employed StoneX to identify patients with kidney stone composition data and mine >125 million notes from our institutional EHR. Analyses performed on the extracted patients included stone type conversions over time, survival analysis from a second stone surgery, and disease associations by stone composition to validate the phenotyping method against known associations. Results:
      
    

    
      The NLP algorithm identified 45,235 text mentions corresponding to 11,585 patients. Overall, the system achieved positive predictive value >90% for calcium oxalate monohydrate, calcium oxalate dihydrate, hydroxyapatite, brushite, and struvite; except for uric acid (positive predictive value = 87.5%). Survival analysis from a second stone surgery showed statistically significant differences among stone types (P = .03). Several phenotype associations were found: uric acid-type 2 diabetes (odds ratio, OR = 2.69, 95% confidence intervals, CI = 1.91-3.79), struvite-neurogenic bladder (OR = 12.27, 95% CI = 4.33-34.79), struvite-urinary tract infection (OR = 7.36, 95% CI = 3.01-17.99), hydroxyapatite-pulmonary collapse (OR = 3.67, 95% CI = 2.10-6.42), hydroxyapatite-neurogenic bladder (OR = 5.23, 95% CI = 2.05-13.36), brushite-calcium metabolism disorder (OR = 4.59, 95% CI = 2.14-9.81), and brushite-hypercalcemia (OR = 4.09, 95% CI = 1.90-8.80). Conclusion:

199,Comparative characterization of flavivirus production in two cell lines: Human hepatoma-derived Huh7.5.1-8 and African green monkey kidney-derived Vero,"The Flaviviridae is a family of enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome. It contains many viruses that threaten human health, such as Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and yellow fever virus (YFV) of the genus Flavivirus as well as hepatitis C virus of the genus Hepacivirus. Cell culture systems highly permissive for the Flaviviridae viruses are very useful for their isolation, propagation, and diagnosis, an understanding of their biology, and the development of vaccines and antiviral agents. Previously, we isolated a human hepatoma HuH-7-derived cell clone, Huh7.5.1-8, which is highly permissive to hepatitis C virus infection. Here, we have characterized flavivirus infection in the Huh7.5.1-8 cell line by comparing with that in the African green monkey kidney-derived Vero cell line, which is permissive for a wide spectrum of viruses. Upon infection with JEV, Huh7.5.1-8 cells produced a higher amount of virus particles early in infection and were more susceptible to virus-induced cell death than Vero cells. Similar outcomes were obtained when the cells were infected with another flavivirus, YFV (17D-204 strain). Quantification of cellular and extracellular viral RNA revealed that high JEV production in Huh7.5.1-8 cells can be attributed to rapid viral replication kinetics and efficient virus release early in infection. In a plaque assay, Huh7.5.1-8 cells developed JEV plaques more rapidly than Vero cells. Although this was not the case with YFV plaques, Huh7.5.1-8 cells developed higher numbers of YFV plaques than Vero cells. Sequence analysis of cDNA encoding an antiviral RNA helicase, RIG-I, showed that Huh7.5.1-8 cells expressed not only a full-length RIG-I mRNA with a known dominant-negative missense mutation but also variants without the mutation. However, the latter mRNAs lacked exon 5/6-12, indicating functional loss of RIG-I in the cells. These characteristics of the Huh7.5.1-8 cell line are helpful for flavivirus detection, titration, and propagation.","['1 Department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', '2 Department of Virology II, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Musashi-murayama-shi, Tokyo, Japan.', '3 Faculty of Information Science and Technology, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.', '4 Global Station for Big Data and Cybersecurity, GI-CoRE, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.', '5 Department of Virology II, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', '6 Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan.']","Kyoko Saito, Masayoshi Fukasawa, Yoshitaka Shirasago, Ryosuke Suzuki, Naoki Osada, Toshiyuki Yamaji, Takaji Wakita, Eiji Konishi, Kentaro Hanada, ",PloS one,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32330205

201,An artificial intelligent diagnostic system on mobile Android terminals for cholelithiasis by lightweight convolutional neural network,"Artificial intelligence (AI) tools have been applied to diagnose or predict disease risk from medical images with recent data disclosure actions, but few of them are designed for mobile terminals due to the limited computational power and storage capacity of mobile devices. In this work, a novel AI diagnostic system is proposed for cholelithiasis recognition on mobile devices with Android platform. To this aim, a data set of CT images of cholelithiasis is firstly collected from The Third Hospital of Shandong Province, China, and then we technically use histogram equalization to preprocess these CT images. As results, a lightweight convolutional neural network is obtained in a constructive way to extract cholelith features and recognize gallstones. In terms of implementation, we compile Java and C++ to adapt to the application of deep learning algorithm on mobile devices with Android platform. Noted that, the training task is completed offline on PC, but cholelithiasis recognition tasks are performed on mobile terminals. We evaluate and compare the performance of our MobileNetV2 with MobileNetV1, Single Shot Detector (SSD), YOLOv2 and original SSD (with VGG-16) as feature extractors for object detection. It is achieved that our MobileNetV2 achieve similar accuracy rate, about 91% with the other four methods, but the number of parameters used is reduced from 36.1M (SSD 300, SSD512), 50.7M (Yolov2) and 5.1M (MobileNetV1) to 4.3M (MobileNetV2).

It is vital to stratify patients early based on their severity, since undertriage can lead to increased morbidity, mortality and costs. Our aim was to present a new approach to assist healthcare professionals at triage in the stratification of patients and in identifying those with higher risk of ICU admission. Adult patients assigned Manchester Triage System (MTS) or Emergency Severity Index (ESI) 1 to 3 from a Portuguese and a United States Emergency Departments were analyzed. Variables routinely collected at triage were used and natural language processing was applied to the patient chief complaint. Stratified random sampling was applied to split the data in train (70%) and test (30%) sets and 10-fold cross validation was performed for model training. Logistic regression, random forests, and a random undersampling boosting algorithm were used. We compared the performance obtained with the reference model-using only triage priorities-with the models using additional variables. For both hospitals, a logistic regression model achieved higher overall performance, yielding areas under the receiver operating characteristic and precision-recall curves of 0.91 (95% CI 0.90-0.92) and 0.30 (95% CI 0.27-0.33) for the United States hospital and of 0.85 (95% CI 0.83-0.86) and 0.06 (95% CI 0.05-0.07) for the Portuguese hospital. Heart rate, pulse oximetry, respiratory rate and systolic blood pressure were the most important predictors of ICU admission.

205,Evaluating information-theoretic measures of word prediction in naturalistic sentence reading,"We review information-theoretic measures of cognitive load during sentence processing that have been used to quantify word prediction effort. Two such measures, surprisal and next-word entropy, suffer from shortcomings when employed for a predictive processing view. We propose a novel metric, lookahead information gain, that can overcome these short-comings. We estimate the different measures using probabilistic language models. Subsequently, we put them to the test by analysing how well the estimated measures predict human processing effort in three data sets of naturalistic sentence reading. Our results replicate the well known effect of surprisal on word reading effort, but do not indicate a role of next-word entropy or lookahead information gain. Our computational results suggest that, in a predictive processing system, the costs of predicting may outweigh the gains. This idea poses a potential limit to the value of a predictive mechanism for the processing of language. The result illustrates the unresolved problem of finding estimations of word-by-word prediction that, first, are truly independent of perceptual processing of the to-be-predicted words, second, are statistically reliable predictors of experimental data, and third, can be derived from more general assumptions about the cognitive processes involved.","['1 Department of Language Science and Technology, Saarland University, Saarbrücken, Germany.

206,Automating the process of identifying the preferred representational system in Neuro Linguistic Programming using Natural Language Processing,"Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP) is a methodology used for recognition of human behavioral patterns and modification of the behavior. A significant part of this process is influenced by the theory of representational systems which equates to the five main senses. The preferred representational system of an individual can explain a large part of exhibited behaviors and characteristics. There are different methods to recognize the representational systems, one of which is to investigate the sensory-based words in the used language during the conversation. However, there are difficulties during this process since there is not a single reference method used for identification of representational systems and existing ones are subject to human interpretations. Some human errors like lack of experience, personal judgment, different levels of skill and personal mistakes may also affect the accuracy and reliability of the existing methods. This research aims to apply a new approach that is to automate the identification process in order to remove human errors, thereby increasing the accuracy and precision. Natural Language Processing has been used for automating this process, and an intelligent software has been developed to identify the preferred representational system with increased accuracy and reliability. This software has been tested and compared to human identification of representational systems. The results of the software are similar to a NLP practitioner, and the software responds more accurately than a human practitioner in various parts of the process. This novel methodology will assist the NLP practitioners to obtain an improved understanding of their clients' behavioral patterns and the associated cognitive and emotional processes.","['1 School of Computing and Digital Media, London Metropolitan University, Tower Building, 166-220 Holloway Road, London, N7 8DB, UK. m.amirhosseini@londonmet.ac.uk.', '2 School of Computing and Digital Media, London Metropolitan University, Tower Building, 166-220 Holloway Road, London, N7 8DB, UK.']","Mohammad Hossein Amirhosseini, Hassan Kazemian, ",Cognitive processing,2019 May,Behavioral patterns; Communication improvement; Natural Language Processing; Neuro Linguistic Programming; Representational systems; Text processing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30835015

      The highly structured nature of medical reports makes them feasible for automated large-scale patient identification. This study aimed to develop a natural language processing (NLP) model to retrospectively retrieve patients with presence and history of carotid stenosis (CS) using their ultrasound reports. Methods:
      
    

    
      Ultrasound reports from our institution between January 2016 and December 2017 were selected. To process the texts, we developed a parser to divide the raw text into fields. For baseline method, we used bag-of-n-grams and term frequency inverse document frequency as the features and used linear classifiers. Logistic regression was performed as the baseline model. Convolution and recurrent neural networks (CNN; RNN) with attention mechanism were applied to the dataset to improve the classification accuracy. Results:
      
    

    
      We had 1220 ultrasound reports for training and 307 for testing, totaling to 1527 reports. For predicting history of CS, both CNN and RNN-attention models had a significantly higher specificity than logistic regression. In addition, RNN-attention also had a significantly higher F1 score and accuracy. For predicting presence of carotid stenosis, all models achieved above 93% accuracy. RNN-attention achieved a 95.4% accuracy, although the difference with logistic regression was not statistically significant. RNN-attention had a statistically significant higher specificity than logistic regression. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We developed linear, CNN, and RNN models to predict history and presence of CS from ultrasound reports.

208,Intranasal delivery of cationic liposome-protamine complex mRNA vaccine elicits effective anti-tumor immunity,"Immunization with synthetic mRNA encoding tumor-associated antigens is an emerging vaccine strategy for the treatment of cancer. In order to prevent mRNA degradation, promote antigen-presenting cells antigen presentation, and induce an anti-tumor immune response, we investigated the nasal administration of mRNA vaccines with positively charged protamine to concentrate mRNA, form a stable polycation-mRNA complex, and encapsulate the complex with DOTAP/Chol/DSPE-PEG cationic liposomes. Cationic liposome/protamine complex (LPC) showed significantly greater efficiency in uptake of vaccine particles in vitro and stronger capacities to stimulate dendritic cell maturation, which further induced a potent anti-tumor immune response. Intranasal immunization of mice with cationic LPC containing mRNA encoding cytokeratin 19 provoked a strong cellular immune response and slowed tumor growth in an aggressive Lewis lung cancer model. The results of this study provide evidence that cationic LPC can be used as a safe and effective adjuvant and this mRNA formulation provides a basis for anti-cancer vaccination of humans.","['1 Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy, Ningxia Medical University, No.1160 Shengli South Street, Yinchuan 750004, PR China.', '2 Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy, Ningxia Medical University, No.1160 Shengli South Street, Yinchuan 750004, PR China.

209,Prediction of emergency department patient disposition based on natural language processing of triage notes,"Background:
      
    

    
      Nursing triage documentation is the first free-form text data created at the start of an emergency department (ED) visit. These 1-3 unstructured sentences reflect the clinical impression of an experienced nurse and are key in gauging a patient's illness. We aimed to predict final ED disposition using three commonly-employed natural language processing (NLP) techniques of nursing triage notes in isolation from other data. Methods:
      
    

    
      We constructed a retrospective cohort of all 260,842 consecutive ED encounters in 2015-16, from three clinically heterogeneous academically-affiliated EDs. After exclusion of 3964 encounters based on completeness of triage, and disposition data, we included 256,878 encounters. We defined the outcome as: 1) admission, transfer, or in-ED death [68,092 encounters] vs. 2) discharge, ""left without being seen,"" and ""left against medical advice"" [188,786 encounters]. The dataset was divided into training and testing subsets. Neural network regression models were trained using bag-of-words, paragraph vectors, and topic distributions to predict disposition and were evaluated using the testing dataset. Results:
      
    

    
      Area under the curve for disposition using triage notes as bag-of-words, paragraph vectors, and topic distributions were 0.737 (95% CI: 0.734 - 0.740), 0.785 (95% CI: 0.782 - 0.788), and 0.687 (95% CI: 0.684 - 0.690), respectively. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Nursing triage notes can be used to predict final ED patient disposition, even when used separately from other clinical information. These findings have substantial implications for future studies, suggesting that free text from medical records may be considered as a critical predictor in research of patient outcomes.","['1 Department of Emergency Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.', '2 Department of Surgery, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA; Health Services Research Center, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.', '3 Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.', '4 Department of Emergency Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.

210,Chemical Strategies to Boost Cancer Vaccines,"Personalized cancer vaccines (PCVs) are reinvigorating vaccine strategies in cancer immunotherapy. In contrast to adoptive T-cell therapy and checkpoint blockade, the PCV strategy modulates the innate and adaptive immune systems with broader activation to redeploy antitumor immunity with individualized tumor-specific antigens (neoantigens). Following a sequential scheme of tumor biopsy, mutation analysis, and epitope prediction, the administration of neoantigens with synthetic long peptide (SLP) or mRNA formulations dramatically improves the population and activity of antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Despite the promising prospect of PCVs, there is still great potential for optimizing prevaccination procedures and vaccine potency. In particular, the arduous development of tumor-associated antigen (TAA)-based vaccines provides valuable experience and rational principles for augmenting vaccine potency which is expected to advance PCV through the design of adjuvants, delivery systems, and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) reversion since current personalized vaccination simply admixes antigens with adjuvants. Considering the broader application of TAA-based vaccine design, these two strategies complement each other and can lead to both personalized and universal therapeutic methods. Chemical strategies provide vast opportunities for (1) exploring novel adjuvants, including synthetic molecules and materials with optimizable activity, (2) constructing efficient and precise delivery systems to avoid systemic diffusion, improve biosafety, target secondary lymphoid organs, and enhance antigen presentation, and (3) combining bioengineering methods to innovate improvements in conventional vaccination, ""smartly"" re-educate the TME, and modulate antitumor immunity. As chemical strategies have proven versatility, reliability, and universality in the design of T cell- and B cell-based antitumor vaccines, the union of such numerous chemical methods in vaccine construction is expected to provide new vigor and vitality in cancer treatment.","['1 Key Laboratory of Bioorganic Phosphorus Chemistry and Chemical Biology (Ministry of Education), Department of Chemistry, Tsinghua University, 100084 Beijing, China.', '2 Beijing Institute for Brain Disorders, 100069 Beijing, China.', '3 Center for Synthetic and Systems Biology, Tsinghua University, 100084 Beijing, China.']","Wen-Hao Li, Yan-Mei Li, ",Chemical reviews,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32914967

212,Natural Language Processing of Radiology Reports in Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma to Predict Radiology Resource Utilization,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Radiology is a finite health care resource in high demand at most health centers. However, anticipating fluctuations in demand is a challenge because of the inherent uncertainty in disease prognosis. The aim of this study was to explore the potential of natural language processing (NLP) to predict downstream radiology resource utilization in patients undergoing surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      All HCC surveillance CT examinations performed at our institution from January 1, 2010, to October 31, 2017 were selected from our departmental radiology information system. We used open source NLP and machine learning software to parse radiology report text into bag-of-words and term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) representations. Three machine learning models-logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), and random forest-were used to predict future utilization of radiology department resources. A test data set was used to calculate accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in addition to the area under the curve (AUC). Results:
      
    

    
      As a group, the bag-of-word models were slightly inferior to the TF-IDF feature extraction approach. The TF-IDF + SVM model outperformed all other models with an accuracy of 92%, a sensitivity of 83%, and a specificity of 96%, with an AUC of 0.971. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      NLP-based models can accurately predict downstream radiology resource utilization from narrative HCC surveillance reports and has potential for translation to health care management where it may improve decision making, reduce costs, and broaden access to care.","['1 Division of Vascular and Interventional Radiology, Department of Medical Imaging, Toronto General Hospital-University Health Network/University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.

214,Modified mRNA as a Therapeutic Tool for the Heart,"Despite various clinical modalities available for patients, heart disease remains among the leading causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Genetic medicine, particularly mRNA, has broad potential as a therapeutic. More specifically, mRNA-based protein delivery has been used in the fields of cancer and vaccination, but recent changes to the structural composition of mRNA have led the scientific community to swiftly embrace it as a new drug to deliver missing genes to injured myocardium and many other organs. Modified mRNA (modRNA)-based gene delivery features transient but potent protein translation and low immunogenicity, with minimal risk of insertional mutagenesis. In this review, we compared and listed the advantages of modRNA over traditional vectors for cardiac therapy, with particular focus on using modRNA therapy in cardiac repair. We present a comprehensive overview of modRNA's role in cardiomyocyte (CM) proliferation, cardiac vascularization, and prevention of cardiac apoptosis. We also emphasize recent advances in modRNA delivery strategies and discuss the challenges for its clinical translation.","['1 Cardiovascular Research Center, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', '2 Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', '3 Black Family Stem Cell Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', '4 Cardiovascular Research Center, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA. lior.zangi@mssm.edu.', '5 Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA. lior.zangi@mssm.edu.', '6 Black Family Stem Cell Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA. lior.zangi@mssm.edu.']","Keerat Kaur, Lior Zangi, ",Cardiovascular drugs and therapy,2020,Cardiac protection; Cardiomyocyte proliferation; Cardiovascular regeneration; Gene therapy; Modified mRNA; Myocardial infarction.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32822006
215,Automatic trial eligibility surveillance based on unstructured clinical data,"Introduction:
      
    

    
      Insufficient patient enrollment in clinical trials remains a serious and costly problem and is often considered the most critical issue to solve for the clinical trials community. In this project, we assessed the feasibility of automatically detecting a patient's eligibility for a sample of breast cancer clinical trials by mapping coded clinical trial eligibility criteria to the corresponding clinical information automatically extracted from text in the EHR. Methods:
      
    

    
      Three open breast cancer clinical trials were selected by oncologists. Their eligibility criteria were manually abstracted from trial descriptions using the OHDSI ATLAS web application. Patients enrolled or screened for these trials were selected as 'positive' or 'possible' cases. Other patients diagnosed with breast cancer were selected as 'negative' cases. A selection of the clinical data and all clinical notes of these 229 selected patients was extracted from the MUSC clinical data warehouse and stored in a database implementing the OMOP common data model. Eligibility criteria were extracted from clinical notes using either manually crafted pattern matching (regular expressions) or a new natural language processing (NLP) application. These extracted criteria were then compared with reference criteria from trial descriptions. This comparison was realized with three different versions of a new application: rule-based, cosine similarity-based, and machine learning-based. Results:
      
    

    
      For eligibility criteria extraction from clinical notes, the machine learning-based NLP application allowed for the highest accuracy with a micro-averaged recall of 90.9% and precision of 89.7%. For trial eligibility determination, the highest accuracy was reached by the machine learning-based approach with a per-trial AUC between 75.5% and 89.8%. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      NLP can be used to extract eligibility criteria from EHR clinical notes and automatically discover patients possibly eligible for a clinical trial with good accuracy, which could be leveraged to reduce the workload of humans screening patients for trials.","['1 Biomedical Informatics Center, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, United States; Division of Hematology/Oncology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, United States.

216,Using natural language processing and VetCompass to understand antimicrobial usage patterns in Australia,"Background:
      
    

    
      Currently there is an incomplete understanding of antimicrobial usage patterns in veterinary clinics in Australia, but such knowledge is critical for the successful implementation and monitoring of antimicrobial stewardship programs. Methods:
      
    

    
      VetCompass Australia collects medical records from 181 clinics in Australia (as of May 2018). These records contain detailed information from individual consultations regarding the medications dispensed. One unique aspect of VetCompass Australia is its focus on applying natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to analyse the records, similar to efforts conducted in other medical studies.

      Free-text imposes a challenge in health data analysis since the lack of structure makes the extraction and integration of information difficult, particularly in the case of massive data. An appropriate machine-interpretation of electronic health records in Chile can unleash knowledge contained in large volumes of clinical texts, expanding clinical management and national research capabilities. Aim:
      
    

    
      To illustrate the use of a weighted frequency algorithm to find keywords. This finding was carried out in the diagnostic suspicion field of the Chilean specialty consultation waiting list, for diseases not covered by the Chilean Explicit Health Guarantees plan. Material and methods:
      
    

    
      The waiting lists for a first specialty consultation for the period 2008-2018 were obtained from 17 out of 29 Chilean health services, and total of 2,592,925 diagnostic suspicions were identified. A natural language processing technique called Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency was used for the retrieval of diagnostic suspicion keywords. Results:
      
    

    
      For each specialty, four key words with the highest weighted frequency were determined. Word clouds showing words weighted by their importance were created to obtain a visual representation. These are available at cimt.uchile.cl/lechile/. Conclusions:

218,Progress in the Use of Antisense Oligonucleotides for Vaccine Improvement,": Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are synthetically prepared short single-stranded deoxynucleotide sequences that have been validated as therapeutic agents and as a valuable tool in molecular driving biology. ASOs can block the expression of specific target genes via complementary hybridization to mRNA. Due to their high specificity and well-known mechanism of action, there has been a growing interest in using them for improving vaccine efficacy. Several studies have shown that ASOs can improve the efficacy of vaccines either by inducing antigen modification such as enhanced expression of immunogenic molecules or by targeting certain components of the host immune system to achieve the desired immune response. However, despite their extended use, some problems such as insufficient stability and low cellular delivery have not been sufficiently resolved to achieve effective and safe ASO-based vaccines. In this review, we analyze the molecular bases and the research that has been conducted to demonstrate the potential use of ASOs in vaccines.","['1 School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Department of Clinical Analysis, São Paulo State University (UNESP), Rod.

220,Deep Learning Natural Language Processing Successfully Predicts the Cerebrovascular Cause of Transient Ischemic Attack-Like Presentations,"Background and Purpose- Triaging of referrals to transient ischemic attack (TIA) clinics is aided by risk stratification. Deep learning-based natural language processing, a type of machine learning, may be able to assist with the prediction of cerebrovascular cause of TIA-like presentations from free-text information. Methods- Consecutive TIA clinic notes were retrieved from existing databases. Texts associated with cerebrovascular and noncerebrovascular diagnoses were preprocessed before classification experiments, using a variety of classifier models, based on only the free-text description of the history of presenting complaint. The primary outcome was area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operator curve. The model with the greatest AUC was then used in classification experiments in which it was provided with additional clinical information. Results- Of the classifier models trialed on the history of presenting complaint, the convolutional neural network achieved the greatest predictive capability (AUC±SD; 81.9±2.0). The effects of additional clinical information on AUC were variable. The greatest AUC was achieved when the convolutional neural network was provided with the history of presenting complaint and magnetic resonance imaging report (88.3±3.6). Conclusions- Deep learning-based natural language processing, in particular convolutional neural networks, based on medical free-text, may prove effective in prediction of the cause of TIA-like presentations. Future research investigating the role of the application of deep learning-based natural language processing to the automated triaging of clinic referrals in TIA, and potentially other specialty areas, is indicated.","['1 From the Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide, Australia (S.B., L.O.-R., T.K., S.P., J.J.).', '2 Australian Institute for Machine Learning, University of Adelaide, Australia (L.O.-R.).', '3 Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Adelaide, Australia (T.Z., T.K., J.J.).']","Stephen Bacchi, Luke Oakden-Rayner, Toby Zerner, Timothy Kleinig, Sandy Patel, Jim Jannes, ",Stroke,2019 Mar,"deep learning; ischemic attack, transient; machine learning; magnetic resonance imaging; natural language processing.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30653397

222,Automated detection of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy risk factors in electronic medical records using natural language processing,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is an important cause of mortality in epilepsy. However, there is a gap in how often providers counsel patients about SUDEP. One potential solution is to electronically prompt clinicians to provide counseling via automated detection of risk factors in electronic medical records (EMRs). We evaluated (1) the feasibility and generalizability of using regular expressions to identify risk factors in EMRs and (2) barriers to generalizability. Methods:
      
    

    
      Data included physician notes for 3000 patients from one medical center (home) and 1000 from five additional centers (away). Through chart review, we identified three SUDEP risk factors: (1) generalized tonic-clonic seizures, (2) refractory epilepsy, and (3) epilepsy surgery candidacy. Regular expressions of risk factors were manually created with home training data, and performance was evaluated with home test and away test data. Performance was evaluated by sensitivity, positive predictive value, and F-measure. Generalizability was defined as an absolute decrease in performance by <0.10 for away versus home test data. To evaluate underlying barriers to generalizability, we identified causes of errors seen more often in away data than home data. To demonstrate how small revisions can improve generalizability, we removed three ""boilerplate"" standard text phrases from away notes and repeated performance. Results:
      
    

    
      We observed high performance in home test data (F-measure range = 0.86-0.90), and low to high performance in away test data (F-measure range = 0.53-0.81). After removing three boilerplate phrases, away performance improved (F-measure range = 0.79-0.89) and generalizability was achieved for nearly all measures. The only significant barrier to generalizability was use of boilerplate phrases, causing 104 of 171 errors (61%) in away data. Significance:
      
    

    
      Regular expressions are a feasible and probably a generalizable method to identify variables related to SUDEP risk. Our methods may be implemented to create large patient cohorts for research and to generate electronic prompts for SUDEP counseling.","['1 Division of Child Neurology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York.', '2 Department of Epidemiology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York.', '3 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.', '4 Saul R.

Early detection of pathological cognitive decline facilitates the greatest impact of restorative or preventative treatments. Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare is the use of computational algorithms that mimic human cognitive functions to analyze complex medical data. AI technologies like machine learning (ML) support the integration of biological, psychological, and social factors when approaching diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of disease. This paper serves to acquaint clinicians and other stakeholders with the use, benefits, and limitations of AI for predicting, diagnosing, and classifying mild and major neurocognitive impairments, by providing a conceptual overview of this topic with emphasis on the features explored and AI techniques employed. We present studies that fell into six categories of features used for these purposes: (1) sociodemographics; (2) clinical and psychometric assessments; (3) neuroimaging and neurophysiology; (4) electronic health records and claims; (5) novel assessments (e.g., sensors for digital data); and (6) genomics/other omics. For each category we provide examples of AI approaches, including supervised and unsupervised ML, deep learning, and natural language processing.

      Structured reports are not widely used and thus most reports exist in the form of free text. The process of data extraction by experts is time-consuming and error-prone, whereas data extraction by natural language processing (NLP) is a potential solution that could improve diagnosis efficiency and accuracy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate an NLP program that determines American College of Radiology Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) descriptors and final assessment categories from breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reports. Methods:
      
    

    
      This cross-sectional study involved 2330 breast MRI reports in the electronic medical record from 2009 to 2017. We used 1635 reports for the creation of a revised BI-RADS MRI lexicon and synonyms lists as well as the iterative development of an NLP system. The remaining 695 reports that were not used for developing the system were used as an independent test set for the final evaluation of the NLP system. The recall and precision of an NLP algorithm to detect the revised BI-RADS MRI descriptors and BI-RADS categories from the free-text reports were evaluated against a standard reference of manual human review. Results:
      
    

    
      There was a high level of agreement between two manual reviewers, with a κ value of 0.95. For all breast imaging reports, the NLP algorithm demonstrated a recall of 78.5% and a precision of 86.1% for correct identification of the revised BI-RADS MRI descriptors and the BI-RADS categories. NLP generated the total results in <1 s, whereas the manual reviewers averaged 3.38 and 3.23 min per report, respectively. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The NLP algorithm demonstrates high recall and precision for information extraction from free-text reports. This approach will help to narrow the gap between unstructured report text and structured data, which is needed in decision support and other applications.","['1 Department of Radiology, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing 100034, China.']","Yi Liu, Li-Na Zhu, Qing Liu, Chao Han, Xiao-Dong Zhang, Xiao-Ying Wang, ",Chinese medical journal,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31268905
225,Nucleic Acid-Based Approaches for Tumor Therapy,"Within the last decade, the introduction of checkpoint inhibitors proposed to boost the patients' anti-tumor immune response has proven the efficacy of immunotherapeutic approaches for tumor therapy. Furthermore, especially in the context of the development of biocompatible, cell type targeting nano-carriers, nucleic acid-based drugs aimed to initiate and to enhance anti-tumor responses have come of age. This review intends to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of the therapeutic use of nucleic acids for cancer treatment on various levels, comprising (i) mRNA and DNA-based vaccines to be expressed by antigen presenting cells evoking sustained anti-tumor T cell responses, (ii) molecular adjuvants, (iii) strategies to inhibit/reprogram tumor-induced regulatory immune cells e.g., by RNA interference (RNAi), (iv) genetically tailored T cells and natural killer cells to directly recognize tumor antigens, and (v) killing of tumor cells, and reprograming of constituents of the tumor microenvironment by gene transfer and RNAi. Aside from further improvements of individual nucleic acid-based drugs, the major perspective for successful cancer therapy will be combination treatments employing conventional regimens as well as immunotherapeutics like checkpoint inhibitors and nucleic acid-based drugs, each acting on several levels to adequately counter-act tumor immune evasion.","['1 Department of Chemistry and Pharmacy, Ludwig-Maximilians-University (LMU), 81377 Munich, Germany.', '2 Department of Dermatology, University Medical Center, 55131 Mainz, Germany.']","Simone Hager, Frederic Julien Fittler, Ernst Wagner, Matthias Bros, ",Cells,2020,adjuvant; antigen; dendritic cell; immunotherapy; nanoparticle; nucleic acids; transgene; tumor.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32917034
226,Developing a portable natural language processing based phenotyping system,"Background:
      
    

    
      This paper presents a portable phenotyping system that is capable of integrating both rule-based and statistical machine learning based approaches. Methods:
      
    

    
      Our system utilizes UMLS to extract clinically relevant features from the unstructured text and then facilitates portability across different institutions and data systems by incorporating OHDSI's OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) to standardize necessary data elements. Our system can also store the key components of rule-based systems (e.g., regular expression matches) in the format of OMOP CDM, thus enabling the reuse, adaptation and extension of many existing rule-based clinical NLP systems. We experimented with our system on the corpus from i2b2's Obesity Challenge as a pilot study. Results:
      
    

    
      Our system facilitates portable phenotyping of obesity and its 15 comorbidities based on the unstructured patient discharge summaries, while achieving a performance that often ranked among the top 10 of the challenge participants. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Our system of standardization enables a consistent application of numerous rule-based and machine learning based classification techniques downstream across disparate datasets which may originate across different institutions and data systems.","['1 Cyberinfrastructure, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, 60612, USA.', '2 Department of Preventive Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, 60611, USA.', '3 Biomedical Informatics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', '4 Health Informatics, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.', '5 Department of Preventive Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, 60611, USA. yuan.luo@northwestern.edu.']","Himanshu Sharma, Chengsheng Mao, Yizhen Zhang, Haleh Vatani, Liang Yao, Yizhen Zhong, Luke Rasmussen, Guoqian Jiang, Jyotishman Pathak, Yuan Luo, ",BMC medical informatics and decision making,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30943974
227,Sam68 Promotes Hepatitis C Virus Replication by Interaction with Stem-Loop 2 of Viral 5' Untranslated Region,"The Src-associated in mitosis 68-kDa (Sam68) protein is a highly conserved nuclear protein and is involved in a series of cellular processes, including transcription and signal transduction. Sam68 is comprised of 443 amino acids and contains an RGG box domain, a KH domain, and a tyrosine-rich domain. Its role in hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication is unknown. Here, we find that Sam68 promotes HCV replication without affecting viral translation. The RNA immunoprecipitation experiments show that the positive strand of HCV RNA interacts with Sam68. HCV infection triggers the translocation of the Sam68 protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it interacts with the HCV genome. Further study shows that the region of Sam68 spanning amino acids 1 to 157 is the pivotal domain to interact with the stem-loop 2 of the HCV 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) and is responsible for the enhancement of HCV replication. These data suggested that Sam68 may serve as a proviral factor of HCV to facilitate viral replication through interaction with the viral genome.IMPORTANCE Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a member of the Flaviviridae family, and its infection causes chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and even hepatocellular carcinoma. No vaccine is available. Many host factors may be implicated in the pathogenesis of HCV-related diseases. This study discloses a new host factor that binds to the HCV 5' UTR and promotes HCV replication. Sam68 may play an important role in HCV-related diseases, and further investigation is highly encouraged to explore its specific actions in HCV pathogenesis.","['1 Institute of Pathogen Biology and Immunology of College of Biology, State Key Laboratory of Chemo/Biosensing and Chemometrics, Hunan University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', '2 Institute of Pathogen Biology and Immunology of College of Biology, State Key Laboratory of Chemo/Biosensing and Chemometrics, Hunan University, Changsha, Hunan, China zhuhaizhen69@yahoo.com.', '3 Research Center of Cancer Prevention and Treatment, Translational Medicine Research Center of Liver Cancer, Hunan Cancer Hospital., Changsha, Hunan, China.']","Yuwen Qin, Zhen Xun, Yanxia Guo, Shengwen Chen, Haizhen Zhu, ",Journal of virology,2019,5′ untranslated region; HCV; Sam68; replication; viral genome.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31068419
228,RNA Sequencing of the In Vivo Human Herpesvirus 6B Transcriptome To Identify Targets for Clinical Assays Distinguishing between Latent and Active Infections,"Human herpesvirus 6B (HHV-6B) DNA is frequently detected in human samples. Diagnostic assays distinguishing HHV-6B reactivation from latency are limited. This has impaired strategies to diagnose and treat HHV-6B-associated diseases. We used RNA sequencing to characterize and compare the HHV-6B transcriptome in multiple sample types, including (i) whole blood from hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients with and without HHV-6B plasma viremia, (ii) tumor tissue samples from subjects with large B cell lymphoma infected with HHV-6B, (iii) lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from subjects with inherited chromosomally integrated HHV-6B or latent infection with HHV-6B, and (iv) HHV-6B Z29 infected SupT1 CD4+ T cells. We demonstrated substantial overlap in the HHV-6B transcriptome observed in in vivo and in vitro samples, although there was variability in the breadth and quantity of gene expression across samples. The HHV-6B viral polymerase gene U38 was the only HHV-6B transcript detected in all next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data sets and was one of the most highly expressed genes. We developed a novel reverse transcription-PCR assay targeting HHV-6B U38, which identified U38 mRNA in all tested whole-blood samples from patients with concurrent HHV-6B viremia. No HHV-6B U38 transcripts were detected by RNA-seq or reverse transcription-real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) in whole-blood samples from subjects without HHV-6B plasma detection or from latently infected LCLs. A RT-qPCR assay for HHV-6B U38 may be useful to identify lytic HHV-6B infection in nonplasma samples and samples from individuals with inherited chromosomally integrated HHV-6B. This study also demonstrates the feasibility of transcriptomic analyses for HCT recipients.IMPORTANCE Human herpesvirus 6B (HHV-6B) is a DNA virus that infects most children within the first few years of life. After primary infection, HHV-6B persists as a chronic, latent infection in many cell types. Additionally, HHV-6B can integrate into germ line chromosomes, resulting in individuals with viral DNA in every nucleated cell. Given that PCR to detect viral DNA is the mainstay for diagnosing HHV-6B infection, the characteristics of HHV-6B infection complicate efforts to distinguish between latent and active viral infection, particularly in immunocompromised patients who have frequent HHV-6B reactivation. In this study, we used RNA sequencing to characterize the HHV-6B gene expression profile in multiple sample types, and our findings identified evidence-based targets for diagnostic tests that distinguish between latent and active viral infection.","['1 Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA jahill3@fredhutch.org.', '2 Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA.', ""3 Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle, Washington, USA."", '4 Genomics and Bioinformatics Shared Resource, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA.', '5 Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.', '6 Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.']","Joshua A Hill, Minako Ikoma, Danielle M Zerr, Ryan S Basom, Vikas Peddu, Meei-Li Huang, Ruth Hall Sedlak, Keith R Jerome, Michael Boeckh, Serge Barcy, ",Journal of virology,2019,HHV-6; RNA sequencing; RNA-seq; bone marrow transplantation; diagnose; diagnostics; gene sequencing; herpes; human herpesviruses; transcription; transcriptome; transplant; transplant infectious diseases.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30429336
229,Psychiatric stressor recognition from clinical notes to reveal association with suicide,"Suicide takes the lives of nearly a million people each year and it is a tremendous economic burden globally. One important type of suicide risk factor is psychiatric stress. Prior studies mainly use survey data to investigate the association between suicide and stressors. Very few studies have investigated stressor data in electronic health records, mostly due to the data being recorded in narrative text. This study takes the initiative to automatically extract and classify psychiatric stressors from clinical text using natural language processing-based methods. Suicidal behaviors were also identified by keywords. Then, a statistical association analysis between suicide ideations/attempts and stressors extracted from a clinical corpus is conducted. Experimental results show that our natural language processing method could recognize stressor entities with an F-measure of 89.01 percent. Mentions of suicidal behaviors were identified with an F-measure of 97.3 percent. The top three significant stressors associated with suicide are health, pressure, and death, which are similar to previous studies. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using natural language processing approaches to unlock information from psychiatric notes in electronic health record, to facilitate large-scale studies about associations between suicide and psychiatric stressors.","['1 The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, USA.', ""2 St. John's School, Houston, USA."", '3 Bowling Green State University, USA.']","Yaoyun Zhang, Olivia R Zhang, Rui Li, Aaron Flores, Salih Selek, Xiang Y Zhang, Hua Xu, ",Health informatics journal,2019 Dec,electronic health records; natural language processing; psychiatric stressor extraction; statistical association; suicide behavior.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30328378
230,Artificial Intelligence-Based Multimodal Risk Assessment Model for Surgical Site Infection (AMRAMS): Development and Validation Study,"Background:
      
    

    
      Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most common types of health care-associated infections. It increases mortality, prolongs hospital length of stay, and raises health care costs. Many institutions developed risk assessment models for SSI to help surgeons preoperatively identify high-risk patients and guide clinical intervention. However, most of these models had low accuracies. Objective:
      
    

    
      We aimed to provide a solution in the form of an Artificial intelligence-based Multimodal Risk Assessment Model for Surgical site infection (AMRAMS) for inpatients undergoing operations, using routinely collected clinical data. We internally and externally validated the discriminations of the models, which combined various machine learning and natural language processing techniques, and compared them with the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (NNIS) risk index. Methods:
      
    

    
      We retrieved inpatient records between January 1, 2014, and June 30, 2019, from the electronic medical record (EMR) system of Rui Jin Hospital, Luwan Branch, Shanghai, China. We used data from before July 1, 2018, as the development set for internal validation and the remaining data as the test set for external validation. We included patient demographics, preoperative lab results, and free-text preoperative notes as our features. We used word-embedding techniques to encode text information, and we trained the LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) model, random forest model, gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) model, convolutional neural network (CNN) model, and self-attention network model using the combined data. Surgeons manually scored the NNIS risk index values. Results:
      
    

    
      For internal bootstrapping validation, CNN yielded the highest mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.889 (95% CI 0.886-0.892), and the paired-sample t test revealed statistically significant advantages as compared with other models (P<.001). The self-attention network yielded the second-highest mean AUROC of 0.882 (95% CI 0.878-0.886), but the AUROC was only numerically higher than the AUROC of the third-best model, GBDT with text embeddings (mean AUROC 0.881, 95% CI 0.878-0.884, P=.47). The AUROCs of LASSO, random forest, and GBDT models using text embeddings were statistically higher than the AUROCs of models not using text embeddings (P<.001). For external validation, the self-attention network yielded the highest AUROC of 0.879. CNN was the second-best model (AUROC 0.878), and GBDT with text embeddings was the third-best model (AUROC 0.872). The NNIS risk index scored by surgeons had an AUROC of 0.651. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our AMRAMS based on EMR data and deep learning methods-CNN and self-attention network-had significant advantages in terms of accuracy compared with other conventional machine learning methods and the NNIS risk index. Moreover, the semantic embeddings of preoperative notes improved the model performance further. Our models could replace the NNIS risk index to provide personalized guidance for the preoperative intervention of SSIs. Through this case, we offered an easy-to-implement solution for building multimodal RAMs for other similar scenarios.","['1 Department of Anesthesiology, Rui Jin Hospital, Luwan Branch, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', '2 Department of Informatics, Rui Jin Hospital, Luwan Branch, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', '3 Department of Infection Prevention and Control, Rui Jin Hospital, Luwan Branch, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', '4 VitalStrategic Research Institute, Shanghai, China.', '5 Synyi Research, Shanghai, China.', '6 Precision Diagnosis and Image Guided Therapy, Philips Research China, Shanghai, China.']","Weijia Chen, Zhijun Lu, Lijue You, Lingling Zhou, Jie Xu, Ken Chen, ",JMIR medical informatics,2020,artificial intelligence; deep learning; electronic medical record; machine learning; natural language processing; neural network; risk assessment model; routinely collected data; surgical site infection; word embedding.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32538798
231,Natural language processing of prehospital emergency medical services trauma records allows for automated characterization of treatment appropriateness,"Background:
      
    

    
      Incomplete prehospital trauma care is a significant contributor to preventable deaths. Current databases lack timelines easily constructible of clinical events. Temporal associations and procedural indications are critical to characterize treatment appropriateness. Natural language processing (NLP) methods present a novel approach to bridge this gap. We sought to evaluate the efficacy of a novel and automated NLP pipeline to determine treatment appropriateness from a sample of prehospital EMS motor vehicle crash records. Methods:
      
    

    
      A total of 142 records were used to extract airway procedures, intraosseous/intravenous access, packed red blood cell transfusion, crystalloid bolus, chest compression system, tranexamic acid bolus, and needle decompression. Reports were processed using four clinical NLP systems and augmented via a word2phrase method leveraging a large integrated health system clinical note repository to identify terms semantically similar with treatment indications. Indications were matched with treatments and categorized as indicated, missed (indicated but not performed), or nonindicated. Automated results were then compared with manual review, and precision and recall were calculated for each treatment determination. Results:
      
    

    
      Natural language processing identified 184 treatments. Automated timeline summarization was completed for all patients. Treatments were characterized as indicated in a subset of cases including the following: 69% (18 of 26 patients) for airway, 54.5% (6 of 11 patients) for intraosseous access, 11.1% (1 of 9 patients) for needle decompression, 55.6% (10 of 18 patients) for tranexamic acid, 60% (9 of 15 patients) for packed red blood cell, 12.9% (4 of 31 patients) for crystalloid bolus, and 60% (3 of 5 patients) for chest compression system. The most commonly nonindicated treatment was crystalloid bolus (22 of 142 patients). Overall, the automated NLP system performed with high precision and recall with over 70% of comparisons achieving precision and recall of greater than 80%. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Natural language processing methodologies show promise for enabling automated extraction of procedural indication data and timeline summarization. Future directions should focus on optimizing and expanding these techniques to scale and facilitate broader trauma care performance monitoring. Level of evidence:

232,How mRNA therapeutics are entering the monoclonal antibody field,"In 1975, Milstein and Köhler revolutionized the medical world with the development of the hybridoma technique to produce monoclonal antibodies. Since then, monoclonal antibodies have entered almost every branch of biomedical research. Antibodies are now used as frontline therapeutics in highly divergent indications, ranging from autoimmune disease over allergic asthma to cancer. Wider accessibility and implementation of antibody-based therapeutics is however hindered by manufacturing challenges and high development costs inherent to protein-based drugs. For these reasons, alternative ways are being pursued to produce and deliver antibodies more cost-effectively without hampering safety. Over the past decade, messenger RNA (mRNA) based drugs have emerged as a highly appealing new class of biologics that can be used to encode any protein of interest directly in vivo. Whereas current clinical efforts to use mRNA as a drug are mainly situated at the level of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccination, three recent preclinical studies have addressed the feasibility of using mRNA to encode therapeutic antibodies directly in vivo. Here, we highlight the potential of mRNA-based approaches to solve several of the issues associated with antibodies produced and delivered in protein format. Nonetheless, we also identify key hurdles that mRNA-based approaches still need to take to fulfill this potential and ultimately replace the current protein antibody format.","['1 VIB Center for Medical Biotechnology, VIB, Ghent, Belgium.

233,Similarity corpus on microbial transcriptional regulation,"Background:
      
    

    
      The ability to express the same meaning in different ways is a well-known property of natural language. This amazing property is the source of major difficulties in natural language processing. Given the constant increase in published literature, its curation and information extraction would strongly benefit from efficient automatic processes, for which corpora of sentences evaluated by experts are a valuable resource. Results:
      
    

    
      Given our interest in applying such approaches to the benefit of curation of the biomedical literature, specifically that about gene regulation in microbial organisms, we decided to build a corpus with graded textual similarity evaluated by curators and that was designed specifically oriented to our purposes. Based on the predefined statistical power of future analyses, we defined features of the design, including sampling, selection criteria, balance, and size, among others. A non-fully crossed study design was applied. Each pair of sentences was evaluated by 3 annotators from a total of 7; the scale used in the semantic similarity assessment task within the Semantic Evaluation workshop (SEMEVAL) was adapted to our goals in four successive iterative sessions with clear improvements in the agreed guidelines and interrater reliability results. Alternatives for such a corpus evaluation have been widely discussed. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      To the best of our knowledge, this is the first similarity corpus-a dataset of pairs of sentences for which human experts rate the semantic similarity of each pair-in this domain of knowledge. We have initiated its incorporation in our research towards high-throughput curation strategies based on natural language processing.","['1 Computational Genomics, Centro de Ciencias Genómicas, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM).

235,Systematic Evaluation of Research Progress on Natural Language Processing in Medicine Over the Past 20 Years: Bibliometric Study on PubMed,"Background:
      
    

    
      Natural language processing (NLP) is an important traditional field in computer science, but its application in medical research has faced many challenges. With the extensive digitalization of medical information globally and increasing importance of understanding and mining big data in the medical field, NLP is becoming more crucial. Objective:
      
    

    
      The goal of the research was to perform a systematic review on the use of NLP in medical research with the aim of understanding the global progress on NLP research outcomes, content, methods, and study groups involved. Methods:
      
    

    
      A systematic review was conducted using the PubMed database as a search platform. All published studies on the application of NLP in medicine (except biomedicine) during the 20 years between 1999 and 2018 were retrieved. The data obtained from these published studies were cleaned and structured. Excel (Microsoft Corp) and VOSviewer (Nees Jan van Eck and Ludo Waltman) were used to perform bibliometric analysis of publication trends, author orders, countries, institutions, collaboration relationships, research hot spots, diseases studied, and research methods. Results:
      
    

    
      A total of 3498 articles were obtained during initial screening, and 2336 articles were found to meet the study criteria after manual screening. The number of publications increased every year, with a significant growth after 2012 (number of publications ranged from 148 to a maximum of 302 annually). The United States has occupied the leading position since the inception of the field, with the largest number of articles published. The United States contributed to 63.01% (1472/2336) of all publications, followed by France (5.44%, 127/2336) and the United Kingdom (3.51%, 82/2336). The author with the largest number of articles published was Hongfang Liu (70), while Stéphane Meystre (17) and Hua Xu (33) published the largest number of articles as the first and corresponding authors. Among the first author's affiliation institution, Columbia University published the largest number of articles, accounting for 4.54% (106/2336) of the total. Specifically, approximately one-fifth (17.68%, 413/2336) of the articles involved research on specific diseases, and the subject areas primarily focused on mental illness (16.46%, 68/413), breast cancer (5.81%, 24/413), and pneumonia (4.12%, 17/413). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      NLP is in a period of robust development in the medical field, with an average of approximately 100 publications annually. Electronic medical records were the most used research materials, but social media such as Twitter have become important research materials since 2015. Cancer (24.94%, 103/413) was the most common subject area in NLP-assisted medical research on diseases, with breast cancers (23.30%, 24/103) and lung cancers (14.56%, 15/103) accounting for the highest proportions of studies.

      We present the design and implementation of an interactive NLP tool for identifying incidental findings in radiology reports, along with a user study evaluating the performance and usability of the tool. Methods:
      
    

    
      Expert reviewers provided gold standard annotations for 130 patient encounters (694 reports) at sentence, section, and report levels. We performed a user study with 15 physicians to evaluate the accuracy and usability of our tool. Participants reviewed encounters split into intervention (with predictions) and control conditions (no predictions). We measured changes in model performance, the time spent, and the number of user actions needed. The System Usability Scale (SUS) and an open-ended questionnaire were used to assess usability. Results:
      
    

    
      Starting from bootstrapped models trained on 6 patient encounters, we observed an average increase in F1 score from 0.31 to 0.75 for reports, from 0.32 to 0.68 for sections, and from 0.22 to 0.60 for sentences on a held-out test data set, over an hour-long study session. We found that tool helped significantly reduce the time spent in reviewing encounters (134.30 vs. 148.44 seconds in intervention and control, respectively), while maintaining overall quality of labels as measured against the gold standard. The tool was well received by the study participants with a very good overall SUS score of 78.67. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The user study demonstrated successful use of the tool by physicians for identifying incidental findings. These results support the viability of adopting interactive NLP tools in clinical care settings for a wider range of clinical applications.","['1 Intelligent Systems Program, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States.', '2 Department of Surgery and Biomedical Informatics, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States.', '3 Department of Surgery, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States.', '4 Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, United States.', '5 Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States.']","Gaurav Trivedi, Esmaeel R Dadashzadeh, Robert M Handzel, Wendy W Chapman, Shyam Visweswaran, Harry Hochheiser, ",Applied clinical informatics,2019 Aug,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31486057
237,Immunization of mice by the co-administration of codon-optimized HPV16 E7 and lL12 genes against HPV16-associated cervical cancer,"Background:
      
    

    
      Various promising procedures have been used to improve the potency of DNA vaccines for the treatment of human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) infections. Interleukin-12 (IL12) is a powerful adjuvant that can contribute to T cell-mediated protection against many pathogens, specifically viruses. Considering the important role of T cell-mediated immunity in tumor clearance, the induction of these responses can help control the progression of tumors in animal models. We have demonstrated that the co-administration of codon-optimized E7 (uE7) gene of HPV16 with interleukin-12 is effective in the development of antitumor responses. Objectives:
      
    

    
      The present study examined the co-administration of codon-optimized HPV16 E7 gene with murine interleukin-12 gene (mIL-12) as a vaccine adjuvant in tumor mice model. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      C57BL/6 mice were studied for tumor progression after injection of recombinant DNA vaccines. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and IFN-γ were measured to evaluate the activity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Measurements of tumor volume and MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay were used for assessment of therapeutic antitumor effects of the vaccines. Results:
      
    

    
      Results showed that DNA vaccines, specifically codon-optimized E7/murine interleukin-12 (mIL-12), elicited significant differences in levels of IFN-γ and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTLs) responses compared to control groups. Furthermore, higher antitumor response and lower tumor size in the vaccine group was significantly evident compared to control group. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The co-administration of codon-optimized HPV16 E7 gene with IL12 significantly enhances the DNA vaccine potency against HPV16-associated cervical cancer.","['1 Hepatitis Research Center, Lorestan University of Medical Sciences, Khorramabad, Iran; School of Allied Medical Sciences, Lorestan University of Medical Sciences, Khorramabad, Iran.', '2 Department of Biology, Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran.', '3 Department of Virology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.', '4 Laboratory of Microbial Biotechnology and Vegetal Protection, Faculty of Sciences, University Ibn Zohr Agadir-Morocco, Morocco.', '5 Hepatitis Research Center, Lorestan University of Medical Sciences, Khorramabad, Iran; Department of Virology, School of Medicine, Lorestan University of Medical Sciences, Khorramabad, Iran.', '6 Infectious Disease Research Center, Golestan University of Medical Sciences, Gorgan, Iran; Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Golestan University of Medical Sciences, Gorgan, Iran.

238,COVID-19 vaccine development and a potential nanomaterial path forward,"The COVID-19 pandemic has infected millions of people with no clear signs of abatement owing to the high prevalence, long incubation period and lack of established treatments or vaccines. Vaccines are the most promising solution to mitigate new viral strains. The genome sequence and protein structure of the 2019-novel coronavirus (nCoV or SARS-CoV-2) were made available in record time, allowing the development of inactivated or attenuated viral vaccines along with subunit vaccines for prophylaxis and treatment. Nanotechnology benefits modern vaccine design since nanomaterials are ideal for antigen delivery, as adjuvants, and as mimics of viral structures. In fact, the first vaccine candidate launched into clinical trials is an mRNA vaccine delivered via lipid nanoparticles. To eradicate pandemics, present and future, a successful vaccine platform must enable rapid discovery, scalable manufacturing and global distribution. Here, we review current approaches to COVID-19 vaccine development and highlight the role of nanotechnology and advanced manufacturing.","['1 Department of NanoEngineering, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', '2 Department of Bioengineering, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', '3 Pro-SPR GmbH, Alsdorf, Germany.', '4 Center for Nano-ImmunoEngineering, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', '5 Institute for Materials Discovery and Design, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', '6 Department of NanoEngineering, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA. nsteinmetz@ucsd.edu.', '7 Department of Bioengineering, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA. nsteinmetz@ucsd.edu.', '8 Center for Nano-ImmunoEngineering, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA. nsteinmetz@ucsd.edu.', '9 Institute for Materials Discovery and Design, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA. nsteinmetz@ucsd.edu.', '10 Department of Radiology, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA. nsteinmetz@ucsd.edu.', '11 Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA. nsteinmetz@ucsd.edu.']","Matthew D Shin, Sourabh Shukla, Young Hun Chung, Veronique Beiss, Soo Khim Chan, Oscar A Ortega-Rivera, David M Wirth, Angela Chen, Markus Sack, Jonathan K Pokorski, Nicole F Steinmetz, ",Nature nanotechnology,2020 Aug,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32669664
239,Characterizing the Dynamics of Learning in Repeated Reference Games,"The language we use over the course of conversation changes as we establish common ground and learn what our partner finds meaningful. Here we draw upon recent advances in natural language processing to provide a finer-grained characterization of the dynamics of this learning process. We release an open corpus (>15,000 utterances) of extended dyadic interactions in a classic repeated reference game task where pairs of participants had to coordinate on how to refer to initially difficult-to-describe tangram stimuli. We find that different pairs discover a wide variety of idiosyncratic but efficient and stable solutions to the problem of reference. Furthermore, these conventions are shaped by the communicative context: words that are more discriminative in the initial context (i.e., that are used for one target more than others) are more likely to persist through the final repetition. Finally, we find systematic structure in how a speaker's referring expressions become more efficient over time: Syntactic units drop out in clusters following positive feedback from the listener, eventually leaving short labels containing open-class parts of speech. These findings provide a higher resolution look at the quantitative dynamics of ad hoc convention formation and support further development of computational models of learning in communication.","['1 Department of Psychology, Stanford University.', '2 Department of Computer Science, Stanford University.']","Robert D Hawkins, Michael C Frank, Noah D Goodman, ",Cognitive science,2020 Jun,Conventions; Interaction; Language use; Meaning; Natural language processing; Semantic embeddings; Syntax.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32496603
240,Development of a Natural Language Processing Tool to Extract Radiation Treatment Sites,"Currently, radiation oncology-specific electronic medical records (EMRs) allow providers to input the radiation treatment site using free text. The purpose of this study is to develop a natural language processing (NLP) tool to extract encoded data from radiation treatment sites in an EMR. Treatment sites were extracted from all patients who completed treatment in our department from April 1, 2011, to April 30, 2013. A system was designed to extract the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) concept codes using a sample of 11,018 unique site names from 31118 radiation therapy (RT) sites. Among those, 5500 unique site name strings that constitute approximately half of the sample were spared as a test set to evaluate the final system. A dictionary and calculated n-gram statistics using UMLS concepts from related semantic types were combined with manually encoded data. There was an average of 2.2 sites per patient. Prior to extraction, the 20 most common unique treatment sites were used 4215 times (38.3%). The most common treatment site was whole brain RT, which was entered using 27 distinct terms for a total of 1063 times. The customized NLP solution displayed great gains as compared to other systems, with a recall of 0.99 and a precision of 0.99. A customized NLP tool was extracting encoded data from radiation treatment sites in an EMR with great accuracy. This can be integrated into a repository of demographic, genomic, treatment, and outcome data to advance personalized oncologic care.","['1 Radiation Oncology, Banner MD Anderson Cancer Center, Gilbert, USA.', '2 School of Biomedical Informatics, The University of Texas Medical School at Houston, Houston, USA.']","Gary Walker, Ergin Soysal, Hua Xu, ",Cureus,2019,natural language processing; radiation therapy; treatment site.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31815074

242,Automatic screening using word embeddings achieved high sensitivity and workload reduction for updating living network meta-analyses,"Objectives:
      
    

    
      We aimed to develop and evaluate an algorithm for automatically screening citations when updating living network meta-analysis (NMA). Study design and setting:
      
    

    
      Our algorithm learns from the initial screening of citations conducted when creating an NMA to automatically identify eligible citations (i.e., needing full-text consideration) when updating the NMA. We evaluated our algorithm on four NMAs from different medical domains. For each NMA we constructed sets of initially screened citations and citations to screen during an update that took place 2 years after the conduct of the NMA. We encoded free text of citations (title and abstract) using word embeddings. On top of this vectorized representation, we fitted a logistic regression model to the set of initially screened citations to predict the eligibility of citations screened during an update. Results:
      
    

    
      Our algorithm achieved 100% sensitivity on two NMAs (100% [95% confidence interval 93-100] and 100% [40-100] sensitivity), and 94% (81-99) and 97% (86-100) on the remaining two others. For all NMAs, our algorithm would have spared to manually screen 1,345 of 2,530 citations, decreasing the workload by 53% (51-55), while missing 3 of 124 eligible citations (2% [1-7]), none of which were finally included in the NMAs after full-text consideration. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      For updating an NMA after 2 years, our algorithm considerably diminished the workload required for screening, and the number of missed eligible citations remained low.","[""1 Centre de Recherche Epidémiologie et Statistique Paris Sorbonne Cité, INSERM U1153, Paris, France; Université Paris Descartes - Sorbonne Paris cité, Paris, France; Hôpital Hôtel-Dieu, Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris, Centre d'Epidémiologie Clinique, Paris, France."", ""2 Centre de Recherche Epidémiologie et Statistique Paris Sorbonne Cité, INSERM U1153, Paris, France; Université Paris Descartes - Sorbonne Paris cité, Paris, France; Hôpital Hôtel-Dieu, Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris, Centre d'Epidémiologie Clinique, Paris, France; Cochrane France, Paris, France."", ""3 Centre de Recherche Epidémiologie et Statistique Paris Sorbonne Cité, INSERM U1153, Paris, France; Université Paris Descartes - Sorbonne Paris cité, Paris, France; Hôpital Hôtel-Dieu, Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris, Centre d'Epidémiologie Clinique, Paris, France; Cochrane France, Paris, France; Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University New York, USA."", ""4 Centre de Recherche Epidémiologie et Statistique Paris Sorbonne Cité, INSERM U1153, Paris, France; Université Paris Descartes - Sorbonne Paris cité, Paris, France; Hôpital Hôtel-Dieu, Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris, Centre d'Epidémiologie Clinique, Paris, France.

243,Deep Natural Language Processing Identifies Variation in Care Preference Documentation,"Context:
      
    

    
      Documentation of care preferences within 48 hours of admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) is a National Quality Forum-endorsed quality metric for older adults. Care preferences are poorly captured by administrative data. Objectives:
      
    

    
      Using deep natural language processing, our aim was to determine the rate of care preference documentation in free-text notes and to assess associated patient factors. Methods:
      
    

    
      Retrospective review of notes by clinicians using a deep natural language processing to identify care preference documentation, including goals-of-care and treatment limitations, within 48 hours of ICU admission within five ICUs (medical, cardiac, surgery, trauma surgery, and cardiac surgery) for adults 75 years and older. Covariates included demographics, ICU type, sequential organ failure assessment score, and need for mechanical ventilation. Results:
      
    

    
      Deep natural language processing reviewed 11,575 clinician notes for 1350 ICU admissions. Median patient age was 84.0 years (interquartile range 78.0-88.4). Overall, 64.7% had documentation of care preferences. Patients with documentation were older (85 vs. 83 years; P < 0.001) and more often female (53.8% vs. 43.4%; P < 0.001). In adjusted analysis, rates of care preference documentation were higher for older patients, females, nonelective admissions, and admissions to the medical vs. the cardiac or surgical ICUs (all P ≤ 0.01). Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Care preference documentation within 48 hours was absent in more than one-third of ICU admissions among patients aged 75 years and older and was more likely to occur in medical vs. cardiac or surgical ICUs.","['1 Department of Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, USA.

245,Domain transformation on biological event extraction by learning methods,"Event extraction and annotation has become a significant focus of recent efforts in biological text mining and information extraction (IE). However, event extraction, event annotation methods, and resources have so far focused almost exclusively on a single domain. State-of-the-art studies on biological event extraction and annotation are typically domain-dependent and domain-restricted. In this paper, we adopt an approach aimed at extracting events and relations for two different tasks by generating a common dataset using transfer learning and structural correspondence learning (SCL). A deep learning event extraction system was developed to evaluate our results. Our approach comprises two stages: (1) generating a dataset from two independent event extraction tasks or domains, and (2) using a classifier model to learn feature patterns from the generated dataset for event and relation extraction. The classifier in the proposed model can extract events and relations irrespective of the domain of the test input. Our study shows that this approach performs competitively compared to domain specific or dependent tasks.","['1 Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan Normal University, No. 88, Ting Zhou Road, Section 4, Taipei 116, Taiwan, ROC.

246,Semi-Supervised Text Classification Framework: An Overview of Dengue Landscape Factors and Satellite Earth Observation,"In recent years there has been an increasing use of satellite Earth observation (EO) data in dengue research, in particular the identification of landscape factors affecting dengue transmission. Summarizing landscape factors and satellite EO data sources, and making the information public are helpful for guiding future research and improving health decision-making. In this case, a review of the literature would appear to be an appropriate tool. However, this is not an easy-to-use tool. The review process mainly includes defining the topic, searching, screening at both title/abstract and full-text levels and data extraction that needs consistent knowledge from experts and is time-consuming and labor intensive. In this context, this study integrates the review process, text scoring, active learning (AL) mechanism, and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) networks, and proposes a semi-supervised text classification framework that enables the efficient and accurate selection of the relevant articles. Specifically, text scoring and BiLSTM-based active learning were used to replace the title/abstract screening and full-text screening, respectively, which greatly reduces the human workload. In this study, 101 relevant articles were selected from 4 bibliographic databases, and a catalogue of essential dengue landscape factors was identified and divided into four categories: land use (LU), land cover (LC), topography and continuous land surface features. Moreover, various satellite EO sensors and products used for identifying landscape factors were tabulated. Finally, possible future directions of applying satellite EO data in dengue research in terms of landscape patterns, satellite sensors and deep learning were proposed. The proposed semi-supervised text classification framework was successfully applied in research evidence synthesis that could be easily applied to other topics, particularly in an interdisciplinary context.","['1 Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Earth System Modeling, Department of Earth System, Science, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China.', '2 Department of Geography, University of Brasilia (UnB), Brasilia CEP 70910-900, Brazil.', '3 International Joint Laboratory Sentinela, FIOCRUZ, UnB, IRD, Rio de Janeiro RJ-21040-900, Brazil.', '4 IRD, UM, UR, UG, UA, UMR ESPACE-DEV, 34090 Montpellier, France.', '5 Qian Xuesen Laboratory of Space Technology, China Academy of Space Technology, Beijing 100094, China.', '6 Center for Healthy Cities, Institute for China Sustainable Urbanization, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China.']","Zhichao Li, Helen Gurgel, Nadine Dessay, Luojia Hu, Lei Xu, Peng Gong, ",International journal of environmental research and public health,2020,deep active learning; dengue; landscape; natural language processing; satellite Earth observation.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32585932

In this study, we add non-sensitive public datasets to EHR training data; (i) scientific medical text and (ii) Wikipedia word vectors. The data, all in Swedish, is used to train a deep learning model using recurrent neural networks. Tests on pseudonymized Swedish EHR clinical notes showed improved precision and recall from 55.62% and 80.02% with the base EHR embedding layer, to 85.01% and 87.15% when Wikipedia word vectors are added. These results suggest that non-sensitive text from the general domain can be used to train robust models for de-identifying Swedish clinical text; and this could be useful in cases where the data is both sensitive and in low-resource languages.","['1 Norwegian Centre for E-health Research, Tromsø, Norway.', '2 Faculty of Science & Technology, UiT - The Arctic University of Norway.', '3 Department of Computer and Systems Sciences, Stockholm University, Sweden.']","Taridzo Chomutare, Kassaye Yitbarek Yigzaw, Andrius Budrionis, Alexandra Makhlysheva, Fred Godtliebsen, Hercules Dalianis, ",Studies in health technology and informatics,2020,EHR; clinical text; de-identification; deep learning; wiki word vectors.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32570364

It is possible that machine learning, using natural language processing, may be able to assist with accurate LOS and discharge destination prediction for this patient group. Emergency department triage and doctor notes were retrospectively collected on consecutive general medical and acute medical unit admissions to a single tertiary hospital from a 2-month period in 2019. These data were used to assess the feasibility of predicting LOS and discharge destination using natural language processing and a variety of machine learning models. 313 patients were included in the study. The artificial neural network achieved the highest accuracy on the primary outcome of predicting whether a patient would remain in hospital for > 2 days (accuracy 0.82, area under the received operator curve 0.75, sensitivity 0.47 and specificity 0.97). When predicting LOS as an exact number of days, the artificial neural network achieved a mean absolute error of 2.9 and a mean squared error of 16.8 on the test set. For the prediction of home as a discharge destination (vs any non-home alternative), all models performed similarly with an accuracy of approximately 0.74. This study supports the feasibility of using natural language processing to predict general medical inpatient LOS and discharge destination. Further research is indicated with larger, more detailed, datasets from multiple centres to optimise and examine the accuracy that may be achieved with such predictions.","['1 Neurology Department, Royal Adelaide Hospital, Port Road, Adelaide, SA, 5000, Australia. stephen.bacchi@sa.gov.au.', '2 University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, 5005, Australia. stephen.bacchi@sa.gov.au.', '3 Neurology Department, Royal Adelaide Hospital, Port Road, Adelaide, SA, 5000, Australia.', '4 University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, 5005, Australia.', '5 Division of Anaesthesia, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 0QQ, UK.']","Stephen Bacchi, Samuel Gluck, Yiran Tan, Ivana Chim, Joy Cheng, Toby Gilbert, David K Menon, Jim Jannes, Timothy Kleinig, Simon Koblar, ",Internal and emergency medicine,2020 Sep,Artificial intelligence; Deep learning; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Neural network; Prognostication.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31898204
250,Unsupervised inference of implicit biomedical events using context triggers,"Background:
      
    

    
      Event extraction from the biomedical literature is one of the most actively researched areas in biomedical text mining and natural language processing. However, most approaches have focused on events within single sentence boundaries, and have thus paid much less attention to events spanning multiple sentences. The Bacteria-Biotope event (BB-event) subtask presented in BioNLP Shared Task 2016 is one such example; a significant amount of relations between bacteria and biotope span more than one sentence, but existing systems have treated them as false negatives because labeled data is not sufficiently large enough to model a complex reasoning process using supervised learning frameworks. Results:
      
    

    
      We present an unsupervised method for inferring cross-sentence events by propagating intra-sentence information to adjacent sentences using context trigger expressions that strongly signal the implicit presence of entities of interest. Such expressions can be collected from a large amount of unlabeled plain text based on simple syntactic constraints, helping to overcome the limitation of relying only on a small number of training examples available. The experimental results demonstrate that our unsupervised system extracts cross-sentence events quite well and outperforms all the state-of-the-art supervised systems when combined with existing methods for intra-sentence event extraction. Moreover, our system is also found effective at detecting long-distance intra-sentence events, compared favorably with existing high-dimensional models such as deep neural networks, without any supervised learning techniques. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our linguistically motivated inference model is shown to be effective at detecting implicit events that have not been covered by previous work, without relying on training data or curated knowledge bases. Moreover, it also helps to boost the performance of existing systems by allowing them to detect additional cross-sentence events. We believe that the proposed model offers an effective way to infer implicit information beyond sentence boundaries, especially when human-annotated data is not sufficient enough to train a robust supervised system.","['1 School of Computing, KAIST, 291 Daehak-ro, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, Republic of Korea.', '2 School of Computing, KAIST, 291 Daehak-ro, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, Republic of Korea. park@nlp.kaist.ac.kr.']","Jin-Woo Chung, Wonsuk Yang, Jong C Park, ",BMC bioinformatics,2020,Bacteria; Biomedical event extraction; Biotope; Cross-sentence relations; Natural language processing; Text mining; Unsupervised inference.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31992184
251,Inside out: optimization of lipid nanoparticle formulations for exterior complexation and in vivo delivery of saRNA,"Self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) is a promising biotherapeutic tool that has been used as a vaccine against both infectious diseases and cancer. saRNA has been shown to induce protein expression for up to 60 days and elicit immune responses with lower dosing than messenger RNA (mRNA). Because saRNA is a large (~9500 nt), negatively charged molecule, it requires a delivery vehicle for efficient cellular uptake and degradation protection. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been widely used for RNA formulations, where the prevailing paradigm is to encapsulate RNA within the particle, including the first FDA-approved small-interfering siRNA therapy. Here, we compared LNP formulations with cationic and ionizable lipids with saRNA either on the interior or exterior of the particle. We show that LNPs formulated with cationic lipids protect saRNA from RNAse degradation, even when it is adsorbed to the surface. Furthermore, cationic LNPs deliver saRNA equivalently to particles formulated with saRNA encapsulated in an ionizable lipid particle, both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we show that cationic and ionizable LNP formulations induce equivalent antibodies against HIV-1 Env gp140 as a model antigen. These studies establish formulating saRNA on the surface of cationic LNPs as an alternative to the paradigm of encapsulating RNA.","['1 Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK.', '2 Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK. r.shattock@imperial.ac.uk.']","Anna K Blakney, Paul F McKay, Bárbara Ibarzo Yus, Yoann Aldon, Robin J Shattock, ",Gene therapy,2019 Sep,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31300730
252,Clinical History Segment Extraction from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Assessments to Model Disease Trajectories,"Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a long-term illness with a wide range of symptoms and condition trajectories. To improve the understanding of these, automated analysis of large amounts of patient data holds promise. Routinely documented assessments are useful for large-scale analysis, however relevant information is mainly in free text. As a first step to extract symptom and condition trajectories, natural language processing (NLP) methods are useful to identify important textual content and relevant information. In this paper, we propose an agnostic NLP method of extracting segments of patients' clinical histories in CFS assessments. Moreover, we present initial results on the advantage of using these segments to quantify and analyse the presence of certain clinically relevant concepts.","[""1 IoPPN, King's College London; NIHR Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre."", '2 University of Glasgow, School of Medicine.', '3 Leicester Medical School.']","Sonia Priou, Natalia Viani, Veshalee Vernugopan, Chloe Tytherleigh, Faduma Abdalla Hassan, Rina Dutta, Trudie Chalder, Sumithra Velupillai, ",Studies in health technology and informatics,2020,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome; Clinical Informatics; Electronic Health Records; Natural Language Processing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32570354

      To profile the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy (MCHP), a population health data centre located at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada. Approach:
      
    

    
      We describe how MCHP was established and funded, and how it continues to operate based on a foundation of trust and respect between researchers at the University of Manitoba and stakeholders in the Manitoba Government's Department of Health. MCHP's research priorities are jointly determined by its scientists' own research interests and by questions put forward from Manitoba government ministries. Data governance, data privacy, data linkage processes and data access are discussed in detail. We also provide three illustrative examples of the MCHP Data Repository in action, demonstrating how studies using a variety of Repository datasets have had an impact on health and social policies and programs in Manitoba. Discussion:
      
    

    
      MCHP has experienced tremendous growth over the last three decades. We discuss emerging research directions as the capacity for innovation at MCHP continues to expand, including a focus on natural language processing and other applications of artificial intelligence techniques, a leadership role in the new SPOR Canadian Data Platform, and a foray into social policy evaluation and analysis. With these and other exciting opportunities on the horizon, the future at MCHP looks exceptionally bright.","['1 Manitoba Centre for Health Policy, Rady Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Manitoba, 408-727 McDermot Ave, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada R3E 3P5.']","A Katz, J Enns, M Smith, C Burchill, K Turner, D Towns, ",International journal of population data science,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32935035
254,Renal Biopsy Recommendation Based on Text Understanding,"Due to various etiologies and pathogenesis of kidney diseases, an invasive procedure called renal biopsy may be needed to determine the specific type of kidney disease, its severity, and the best treatment for it. This study aims to detmine if a text understanding technology based on admission records can recommend such an invasive procedure objectively. To understand clinical documents from nephrology, a semi-automatic learning-based lexicon construction method based on CRF and Word2vec was used. We constructed a dictionary of symptom terms for the nephrology department from clinical document, and then extracted patients' symptoms and detected their negation from admission notes. Combined with the preliminary diagnosis given by the doctor, an eigenvector was produced and fed to a machine learning classifier. When compared to the gold standard marked by physicians, the final recommendation achieved 83.5% accuracy, 80.6% precision, 76.6% recall, and 78.6% f1-measure respectively.","['1 College of Biomedical Engineering and Instrument Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', ""2 The Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.""]","Yang Lu, Zheng Jia, Xian Zeng, Chunyue Feng, Xudong Lu, Huilong Duan, Haomin Li, ",Studies in health technology and informatics,2019,Clinical; Decision Support Systems; Kidney Diseases; Natural Language Processing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31438012
255,Automatic extraction and assessment of lifestyle exposures for Alzheimer's disease using natural language processing,"Introduction:
      
    

    
      Previous biomedical studies identified many lifestyle exposures that could possibly represent risk factors for dementia in general or dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). These lifestyle exposures are mainly mentioned in free-text electronic health records (EHRs). However, automatic extraction and assessment of these exposures using EHRs remains understudied. Methods:
      
    

    
      A natural language processing (NLP) approach was adopted to extract lifestyle exposures and intervention strategies from the clinical notes of 260 patients with clinical diagnoses of AD dementia and 260 age-matched cognitively unimpaired persons. Statistics of lifestyle exposures were compared between these two groups. The mapping results of the NLP extraction were evaluated by comparing the results with data captured independently by clinicians. Results:
      
    

    
      Thirty out of fifty-five potentially relevant lifestyle exposures were mentioned in our clinical note dataset. Twenty-two dietary factors and three substance abuses that were potentially relevant were not found in clinical notes. Patients with AD dementia were significantly exposed to more of the potential risk factors compared to the cognitively unimpaired subjects (χ2 = 120.31, p-value < 0.001). The average accuracy of the automated extraction was 74.0% in comparison with the manual review of randomly selected 50 sample documents. Discussion and conclusion:
      
    

    
      We illustrated the feasibility of NLP techniques for the automated evaluation of a large number lifestyle habits using free-text EHR data. We found that AD dementia patients were exposed to more of the potential risk factors than the comparison group. Our results also demonstrated the feasibility and accuracy of investigating putative risk factors using NLP techniques.","['1 Department of Health Science Research, Mayo Clinic, MN, USA.', '2 Department of Health Science Research, Mayo Clinic, MN, USA.

257,Saffron inhibits the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma via inducing cell apoptosis,"Background:
      
    

    
      Liver cancer remains the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of saffron on liver cancer cell line QGY-7703 and the underlying molecular mechanism. Methods:
      
    

    
      Cell growth was detected by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay and cell cycle was assessed by ﬂow cytometry. Besides, cell apoptosis was analyzed by Annexin V/PI (Propidium Iodide) staining, and the senescent cells morphology staining of β-galactosidase was evaluated by microscopy. In addition, ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) Kit was used to assess the activity of telomerase. Moreover, reverse transcription-PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and Western blot analysis was applied to detect mRNA and protein expression levels, respectively. Results:
      
    

    
      Saffron treatment in QGY-7703 cells could significantly inhibit cell growth, arrest cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase, and induce cell apoptosis. Besides, the treatment of saffron could obviously decrease telomerase activity and hTERT level in QGY-7703 cells. In addition, enhanced Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and increased expression of P21 were found in saffron-treated cells. Moreover, we found that the number of senescent cells increased dramatically and the morphology of cells changed obviously after saffron treatment. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Saffron administration may provide some experimental evidence for the inhibitory effect of saffron on the proliferation of QGY-7703 cells, suggesting that saffron may have potential utility for the treatment of liver cancer.","[""1 Department of Pharmacy of Traditional Medicine, People's Hospital of Rizhao, Rizhao, China."", ""2 Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, People's Hospital of Rizhao, Rizhao, China."", '3 Department of Pharmacy, Wulian County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Rizhao, China.', ""4 Preventive Vaccination Clinics, the People's Hospital of Zhangqiu Area, Jinan, China."", ""5 Department of Surgery, the People's Hospital of Zhangqiu Area, Jinan, China."", ""6 Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, People's Hospital of Rizhao, Rizhao, China - zextd427@163.com.""]","Tao Liu, Li Tian, Xuefeng Fu, Lili Wei, Jing Li, Tingting Wang, ",Panminerva medica,2020 Mar,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30657284
258,Immunotherapy Based on Dendritic Cell-Targeted/-Derived Extracellular Vesicles-A Novel Strategy for Enhancement of the Anti-tumor Immune Response,"Dendritic cell (DC)-based anti-tumor vaccines have great potential for the treatment of cancer. To date, a large number of clinical trials involving DC-based vaccines have been conducted with a view to treating tumors of different histological origins. However, DC-based vaccines had several drawbacks, including problems with targeted delivery of tumor antigens to DCs and prolong storage of cellular vaccines. Therefore, the development of other immunotherapeutic approaches capable of enhancing the immunogenicity of existing DC-based vaccines or directly triggering anti-tumor immune responses is of great interest. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released by almost all types of eukaryotic cells for paracrine signaling. EVs can interact with target cells and change their functional activity by delivering different signaling molecules including mRNA, non-coding RNA, proteins, and lipids. EVs have potential benefits as natural vectors for the delivery of RNA and other therapeutic molecules targeted to DCs, T-lymphocytes, and tumor cells; therefore, EVs are a promising entity for the development of novel cell-free anti-tumor vaccines that may be a favourable alternative to DC-based vaccines. In the present review, we discuss the anti-tumor potential of EVs derived from DCs, tumors, and other cells. Methods of EV isolation are systematized, and key molecules carried by EVs that are necessary for the activation of a DC-mediated anti-tumor immune response are analyzed with a focus on the RNA component of EVs. Characteristics of anti-tumor immune responses induced by EVs in vitro and in vivo are reviewed. Finally, perspectives and challenges with the use of EVs for the development of anti-tumor cell-free vaccines are considered.","['1 Laboratory of Nucleic Acids Biochemistry, Institute of Chemical Biology and Fundamental Medicine SB RAS, Novosibirsk, Russia.']","Oleg Markov, Anastasiya Oshchepkova, Nadezhda Mironova, ",Frontiers in pharmacology,2019,anti-tumor vaccines; dendritic cells; exosomes; extracellular vesicles; tumor.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31680949
259,The Predictive Validity of Machine Learning Models in the Classification and Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder: State of the Art and Future Directions,"Major depressive disorder imposes a substantial disease burden worldwide, ranking as the third leading contributor to global disability. In spite of its ubiquity, classifying and treating depression has proven troublesome. One argument put forward to explain this predicament is the heterogeneity of patients diagnosed with the disorder. Recently, many areas of daily life have witnessed the surge of machine learning techniques, computational approaches to elucidate complex patterns in large datasets, which can be employed to make predictions and detect relevant clusters. Due to the multidimensionality at play in the pathogenesis of depression, it is suggested that machine learning could contribute to improving classification and treatment. In this paper, we investigated literature focusing on the use of machine learning models on datasets with clinical variables of patients diagnosed with depression to predict treatment outcomes or find more homogeneous subgroups. Identified studies based on best practices in the field are evaluated. We found 16 studies predicting outcomes (such as remission) and identifying clusters in patients with depression. The identified studies are mostly still in proof-of-concept phase, with small datasets, lack of external validation, and providing single performance metrics. Larger datasets, and models with similar variables present across these datasets, are needed to develop accurate and generalizable models. We hypothesize that harnessing natural language processing to obtain data 'hidden' in clinical texts might prove useful in improving prediction models. Besides, researchers will need to focus on the conditions to feasibly implement these models to support psychiatrists and patients in their decision-making in practice. Only then we can enter the realm of precision psychiatry.","['1 Department of Psychiatry, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands.']","Nick J Ermers, Karin Hagoort, Floortje E Scheepers, ",Frontiers in psychiatry,2020,electronic health records; machine learning; major depressive disorder; natural language processing; precision psychiatry; predictive modeling.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32523557
260,Identifying and classifying opioid-related overdoses: A validation study,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      The study aims to develop and validate algorithms to identify and classify opioid overdoses using claims and other coded data, and clinical text extracted from electronic health records using natural language processing (NLP). Methods:
      
    

    
      Primary data were derived from Kaiser Permanente Northwest (2008-2014), an integrated health care system (~n > 475 000 unique individuals per year). Data included International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes for nonfatal diagnoses, International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes for fatal events, clinical notes, and prescription medication records. We assessed sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for algorithms relative to medical chart review and conducted assessments of algorithm portability in Kaiser Permanente Washington, Tennessee State Medicaid, and Optum. Results:
      
    

    
      Code-based algorithm performance was excellent for opioid-related overdoses (sensitivity = 97.2%, specificity = 84.6%) and classification of heroin-involved overdoses (sensitivity = 91.8%, specificity = 99.0%). Performance was acceptable for code-based suicide/suicide attempt classifications (sensitivity = 70.7%, specificity = 90.5%); sensitivity improved with NLP (sensitivity = 78.7%, specificity = 91.0%). Performance was acceptable for the code-based substance abuse-involved classification (sensitivity = 75.3%, specificity = 79.5%); sensitivity improved with the NLP-enhanced algorithm (sensitivity = 80.5%, specificity = 76.3%). The opioid-related overdose algorithm performed well across portability assessment sites, with sensitivity greater than 96% and specificity greater than 84%. Cross-site sensitivity for heroin-involved overdose was greater than 87%, specificity greater than or equal to 99%. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Code-based algorithms developed to detect opioid-related overdoses and classify them according to heroin involvement perform well. Algorithms for classifying suicides/attempts and abuse-related opioid overdoses perform adequately for use for research, particularly given the complexity of classifying such overdoses. The NLP-enhanced algorithms for suicides/suicide attempts and abuse-related overdoses perform significantly better than code-based algorithms and are appropriate for use in settings that have data and capacity to use NLP.","['1 Center for Health Research, Kaiser Permanente Northwest, Portland, Oregon.', '2 Johns Hopkins School of Nursing, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland.', '3 Indivior, Inc.

261,In Vivo Delivery of Nucleic Acid-Encoded Monoclonal Antibodies,"Antibody immunotherapy is revolutionizing modern medicine. The field has advanced dramatically over the past 40 years, driven in part by major advances in isolation and manufacturing technologies that have brought these important biologics to the forefront of modern medicine. However, the global uptake of monoclonal antibody (mAb) biologics is impeded by biophysical and biochemical liabilities, production limitations, the need for cold-chain storage and transport, as well as high costs of manufacturing and distribution. Some of these hurdles may be overcome through transient in vivo gene delivery platforms, such as non-viral synthetic plasmid DNA and messenger RNA vectors that are engineered to encode optimized mAb genes. These approaches turn the body into a biological factory for antibody production, eliminating many of the steps involved in bioprocesses and providing several other significant advantages, and differ from traditional gene therapy (permanent delivery) approaches. In this review, we focus on nucleic acid delivery of antibody employing synthetic plasmid DNA vector platforms, and RNA delivery, these being important approaches that are advancing simple, rapid, in vivo expression and having an impact in animal models of infectious diseases and cancer, among others.","['1 Vaccine and Immunotherapy Center, The Wistar Institute, 3601 Spruce Street, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA.', '2 Vaccine and Immunotherapy Center, The Wistar Institute, 3601 Spruce Street, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA. dweiner@wistar.org.']","Ami Patel, Mamadou A Bah, David B Weiner, ","BioDrugs : clinical immunotherapeutics, biopharmaceuticals and gene therapy",2020 Jun,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32157600

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we apply advanced natural language processing (NLP) technology to conduct data mining and feature extraction on the microblog data from the Wuhan area and the imported case province (Henan Province) during the high and median operating periods of the epidemic. Our experiment indicates that the semantic and sentiment vocabulary of words, the sentiment curve, and the portrait of patients seeking help were all heterogeneous in the context of COVID-19. We extract and acquire the outlier knowledge of COVID-19 and incorporate it into the outlier knowledge base of extreme public health events for knowledge sharing and transformation.

      We investigated the impact of clinical guidelines for the management of minor head injury on utilization and diagnostic yield of head CT over two decades. Methods:
      
    

    
      Retrospective before-after study using multiple electronic health record data sources. Natural language processing algorithms were developed to rapidly extract indication, Glasgow Coma Scale, and CT outcome from clinical records, creating two datasets: one based on all head injury CTs from 1997 to 2009 (n = 9109), for which diagnostic yield of intracranial traumatic findings was calculated. The second dataset (2009-2014) used both CT reports and clinical notes from the emergency department, enabling selection of minor head injury patients (n = 4554) and calculation of both CT utilization and diagnostic yield. Additionally, we tested for significant changes in utilization and yield after guideline implementation in 2011, using chi-square statistics and logistic regression. Results:
      
    

    
      The yield was initially nearly 60%, but in a decreasing trend dropped below 20% when CT became routinely used for head trauma. Between 2009 and 2014, of 4554 minor head injury patients overall, 85.4% underwent head CT. After guideline implementation in 2011, CT utilization significantly increased from 81.6 to 87.6% (p = 7 × 10-7), while yield significantly decreased from 12.2 to 9.6% (p = 0.029). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The number of CTs performed for head trauma gradually increased over two decades, while the yield decreased. In 2011, despite implementation of a guideline aiming to improve selective use of CT in minor head injury, utilization significantly increased. Key points:
      
    

    
      • Over two decades, the number of head CTs performed for minor, moderate, and severe head injury gradually increased, while the diagnostic yield for intracranial findings showed a decreasing trend. • Despite the implementation of a guideline in 2011, aiming to improve selective use of CT in minor head injury, utilization significantly increased, while diagnostic yield significantly decreased. • Natural language processing is a valuable tool to monitor the utilization and diagnostic yield of imaging as a potential quality-of-care indicator.","['1 Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', '2 Department of Medical Informatics, Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', '3 Department of Public Health, Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam, PO Box 2040, 3000 CA, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. k.foks@erasmusmc.nl.', '4 Department of Neurology, Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. k.foks@erasmusmc.nl.', '5 Department of Neurology, Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', '6 Department of Epidemiology, Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', '7 Center for Health Decision Sciences, Harvard T.H.

Here, we show that unmodified exogenous circRNA is able to bypass cellular RNA sensors and thereby avoid provoking an immune response in RIG-I and Toll-like receptor (TLR) competent cells and in mice. The immunogenicity and protein expression stability of circRNA preparations are found to be dependent on purity, with small amounts of contaminating linear RNA leading to robust cellular immune responses. Unmodified circRNA is less immunogenic than unmodified linear mRNA in vitro, in part due to the evasion of TLR sensing. Finally, we provide the first demonstration to our knowledge of exogenous circRNA delivery and translation in vivo, and we show that circRNA translation is extended in adipose tissue in comparison to unmodified and uridine-modified linear mRNAs.","['1 David H.

      The objective of this study was to assess the classification capability of Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) ultrasound feature descriptors targeting established commercial transcriptomic gene signatures that guide management of breast cancer. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      This retrospective, single-institution analysis of 219 patients involved two cohorts using one of two FDA approved transcriptome-based tests that were performed as part of the clinical care of breast cancer patients at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center between April 2008 and January 2013. BI-RADS descriptive terminology was collected from the corresponding ultrasound reports for each patient in conjunction with transcriptomic test results. Recursive partitioning and regression trees were used to test and validate classification of the two cohorts. Results:
      
    

    
      The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operator curves (ROC) for the regression classifier between the two FDA approved tests and ultrasound features were 0.77 and 0.65, respectively; they employed the 'margins', 'retrotumoral', and 'internal echoes' feature descriptors. Notably, the 'retrotumoral' and mass 'margins' features were used in both classification trees. The identification of sonographic correlates of gene tests provides added value to the ultrasound exam without incurring additional procedures or testing. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The predictive capability using structured language from diagnostic ultrasound reports (BI-RADS) was moderate for the two tests, and provides added value from ultrasound imaging without incurring any additional costs. Incorporation of additional measures, such as ultrasound contrast enhancement, with validation in larger, prospective studies may further substantiate these results and potentially demonstrate even greater predictive utility.","['1 UCLA Department of Radiological Sciences, Los Angeles, CA, United States of America.', '2 UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, United States of America.', '3 Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Department of Surgery, Los Angeles, CA, United States of America.', '4 Department of Radiology, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.']","Neema Jamshidii, Jason Chang, Kyle Mock, Brian Nguyen, Christine Dauphine, Michael D Kuo, ",PloS one,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31923222

Methods: Sexual trauma concepts were extracted from from 362,559 clinical notes using a natural language processing pipeline. Results: We observed variations in the presence of sexual trauma in notes across five United States regions: Pacific, Continental, Midwest, North Atlantic, Southeast. We also observed variations in the types of notes used to document sexual trauma (e.g., mental health, primary care) and sources of sexual trauma (e.g., adult, childhood, military) mentioned in the EHR. Our findings illustrate potential differences in cultural norms related to patient disclosure of sensitive information, and provider documentation. Standardized protocol for eliciting and documenting sexual trauma histories are needed to ensure Veteran access to high quality, trauma-informed care.","['1 Informatics, Decision-Enhancement and Analytic Sciences (IDEAS) Center of Innovation VA Salt Lake City Health Care System, Salt Lake City, UT.', '2 University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT.', '3 Utah State University, Logan, UT.']","Audrey L Jones, Warren B P Pettey, Marjorie E Carter, Emily Brignone, Andrew Redd, Ying Suo, Guy Divita, Rebecca K Blais, Jamison D Fargo, Adi V Gundlapalli, ",AMIA ...

269,Body Maps of Moral Concerns,"It has been proposed that somatosensory reaction to varied social circumstances results in feelings (i.e., conscious emotional experiences). Here, we present two preregistered studies in which we examined the topographical maps of somatosensory reactions associated with violations of different moral concerns. Specifically, participants in Study 1 (N = 596) were randomly assigned to respond to scenarios involving various moral violations and were asked to draw key aspects of their subjective somatosensory experience on two 48,954-pixel silhouettes. Our results show that body patterns corresponding to different moral violations are felt in different regions of the body depending on whether individuals are classified as liberals or conservatives. We also investigated how individual differences in moral concerns relate to body maps of moral violations. Finally, we used natural-language processing to predict activation in body parts on the basis of the semantic representation of textual stimuli. We replicated these findings in a nationally representative sample in Study 2 (N = 300). Overall, our findings shed light on the complex relationships between moral processes and somatosensory experiences.","['1 Department of Psychology, University of Southern California.', '2 Brain and Creativity Institute, University of Southern California.', '3 Department of Computer Science, University of Southern California.']","Mohammad Atari, Aida Mostafazadeh Davani, Morteza Dehghani, ",Psychological science,2020 Feb,emotion; feeling; moral-foundations theory; morality; natural-language processing; open data; open materials; preregistered.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31913779
270,Nanomedicines to Deliver mRNA: State of the Art and Future Perspectives,"The use of messenger RNA (mRNA) in gene therapy is increasing in recent years, due to its unique features compared to plasmid DNA: Transient expression, no need to enter into the nucleus and no risk of insertional mutagenesis. Nevertheless, the clinical application of mRNA as a therapeutic tool is limited by its instability and ability to activate immune responses; hence, mRNA chemical modifications together with the design of suitable vehicles result essential. This manuscript includes a revision of the strategies employed to enhance in vitro transcribed (IVT) mRNA functionality and efficacy, including the optimization of its stability and translational efficiency, as well as the regulation of its immunostimulatory properties. An overview of the nanosystems designed to protect the mRNA and to overcome the intra and extracellular barriers for successful delivery is also included. Finally, the present and future applications of mRNA nanomedicines for immunization against infectious diseases and cancer, protein replacement, gene editing, and regenerative medicine are highlighted.","['1 Pharmacokinetics, Nanotechnology & Gene Therapy Group (PharmaNanoGene), Faculty of Pharmacy, Centro de investigación Lascaray ikergunea, University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU, Paseo de la Universidad 7, 01015 Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain.']","Itziar Gómez-Aguado, Julen Rodríguez-Castejón, Mónica Vicente-Pascual, Alicia Rodríguez-Gascón, María Ángeles Solinís, Ana Del Pozo-Rodríguez, ","Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2020,Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cells; cancer immunotherapy; dendritic cells; gene editing; gene therapy; immunotherapy; in vitro transcribed messenger RNA (IVT mRNA); infectious disease vaccines; nanomedicine; protein replacement.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32093140
271,Automated extraction of sudden cardiac death risk factors in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients by natural language processing,"Background:
      
    

    
      The management of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients requires the knowledge of risk factors associated with sudden cardiac death (SCD). SCD risk factors such as syncope and family history of SCD (FH-SCD) as well as family history of HCM (FH-HCM) are documented in electronic health records (EHRs) as clinical narratives. Automated extraction of risk factors from clinical narratives by natural language processing (NLP) may expedite management workflow of HCM patients. The aim of this study was to develop and deploy NLP algorithms for automated extraction of syncope, FH-SCD, and FH-HCM from clinical narratives. Methods and results:
      
    

    
      We randomly selected 200 patients from the Mayo HCM registry for development (n = 100) and testing (n = 100) of NLP algorithms for extraction of syncope, FH-SCD as well as FH-HCM from clinical narratives of EHRs. The clinical reference standard was manually abstracted by 2 independent annotators. Performance of NLP algorithms was compared to aggregation and summarization of data entries in the HCM registry for syncope, FH-SCD, and FH-HCM. We also compared the NLP algorithms with billing codes for syncope as well as responses to patient survey questions for FH-SCD and FH-HCM. These analyses demonstrated NLP had superior sensitivity (0.96 vs 0.39, p < 0.001) and comparable specificity (0.90 vs 0.92, p = 0.74) and PPV (0.90 vs 0.83, p = 0.37) compared to billing codes for syncope. For FH-SCD, NLP outperformed survey responses for all parameters (sensitivity: 0.91 vs 0.59, p = 0.002; specificity: 0.98 vs 0.50, p < 0.001; PPV: 0.97 vs 0.38, p < 0.001). NLP also achieved superior sensitivity (0.95 vs 0.24, p < 0.001) with comparable specificity (0.95 vs 1.0, p-value not calculable) and positive predictive value (PPV) (0.92 vs 1.0, p = 0.09) compared to survey responses for FH-HCM. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Automated extraction of syncope, FH-SCD and FH-HCM using NLP is feasible and has promise to increase efficiency of workflow for providers managing HCM patients.","['1 Division of Digital Health Sciences, Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', '2 Division of Biomedical Statistics and Informatics, Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', '3 Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', '4 Robert and Patricia Kern Center for Science of Health Care Delivery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', '5 Robert and Patricia Kern Center for Science of Health Care Delivery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA; Division of Community Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', '6 Division of Digital Health Sciences, Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.

273,Narrative video scene description task discriminates between levels of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease,"The process of interpreting and acting upon the visual environment requires both intact cognitive and visual systems. The narrative description (ND) task, initially developed to detect changes in ecologically relevant visual function in people with impaired vision, is an objective measure of the ability to perceive, understand, and describe a visual scene in a movie clip. Objective:
      
    

    
      Because the ND task draws heavily on semantic and working memory ability in addition to basic visual perception, we aimed to assess the discriminative performance of this task across levels of cognitive impairment. Method:
      
    

    
      We recruited 56 participants with cognitive status ranging from normal cognition to mild dementia (median age 82, range 66 to 99 years) to watch 20 30-s video clips and describe the visual content without time constraints. These verbal responses were transcribed and processed to generate ND shared word scores using a ""wisdom of the crowd,"" natural-language processing approach. We compared ND scores across diagnostic groups, and used linear mixed models to examine decrements in task performance. Results:
      
    

    
      There was a stepwise decline of ND scores with increasing levels of cognitive impairment. Additional analyses showed that ND performance was highly related to performance on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and domain-specific neuropsychological tests for semantic fluency and set shifting. Other models demonstrated differences in ND performance related video content between cognitively normal and impaired participants. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The ND test was able to detect decrements in task performance between levels of cognitive impairment and was related to other global neuropsychological measures.

      Cationic liposomes (CLs) based messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine has been a promising approach for cancer treatment. However, rapid lung accumulation after intraveous injection and significently decreased transfection efficacy (TE) in serum substantially hamper its application. Objective:
      
    

    
      In this study, we attempt to investigate fate of Mannose-PEG1000-lipoplex (MP1000-LPX) in vivo, a previous reported mRNA vaccine, and potential mechanism in it. Methods:
      
    

    
      MP1000-CLs and different type of MP1000-LPX were produced by previous method and characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS). Organ distribution and Luc-mRNA expression of DiD loaded luciferase (Luc-mRNA)- MP1000-LPX were evaluated by IVIS Spectrum imaging system. Cellular transfection and uptake under serum-free and serum-containing conditions were analysed by flow cytometry and counted by FlowJo software. Results:
      
    

    
      MP1000-CLs had an average size of 45.3 ± 0.9 nm, a positive charge of 39.9 ± 0.9 mV. When MP1000-LPX formed, the particle size increased to about 130 nm, and zeta potential decreased to about 30 mV. All formulations were in narrow size distribution with PDI < 0.3. 6 h after intraveous injection, Luc-MP1000-LPX mostly distributed to liver, lung and spleen, while only successfully expressed Luc in lung. DC2.4 cellular transfection assay indicated serum substantially lowered TE of MP1000-LPX. However, the cellular uptake on DC2.4 cells was enhanced in the presence of serum. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      MP1000-LPX distributed to spleen but failed to transfect. Because serum dramatically decreased TE of MP1000-LPX on DC2.4 cells, but not by impeding its interaction to cell membrane. Serum resistance and avoidance of lung accumulation might be prerequisites for CLs based intravenous mRNA vaccines.","['1 West China School of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmacy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu.

276,Improving Electronic Health Record Note Comprehension With NoteAid: Randomized Trial of Electronic Health Record Note Comprehension Interventions With Crowdsourced Workers,"Background:
      
    

    
      Patient portals are becoming more common, and with them, the ability of patients to access their personal electronic health records (EHRs). EHRs, in particular the free-text EHR notes, often contain medical jargon and terms that are difficult for laypersons to understand. There are many Web-based resources for learning more about particular diseases or conditions, including systems that directly link to lay definitions or educational materials for medical concepts. Objective:
      
    

    
      Our goal is to determine whether use of one such tool, NoteAid, leads to higher EHR note comprehension ability. We use a new EHR note comprehension assessment tool instead of patient self-reported scores. Methods:
      
    

    
      In this work, we compare a passive, self-service educational resource (MedlinePlus) with an active resource (NoteAid) where definitions are provided to the user for medical concepts that the system identifies. We use Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to recruit individuals to complete ComprehENotes, a new test of EHR note comprehension. Results:
      
    

    
      Mean scores for individuals with access to NoteAid are significantly higher than the mean baseline scores, both for raw scores (P=.008) and estimated ability (P=.02). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      In our experiments, we show that the active intervention leads to significantly higher scores on the comprehension test as compared with a baseline group with no resources provided. In contrast, there is no significant difference between the group that was provided with the passive intervention and the baseline group. Finally, we analyze the demographics of the individuals who participated in our AMT task and show differences between groups that align with the current understanding of health literacy between populations. This is the first work to show improvements in comprehension using tools such as NoteAid as measured by an EHR note comprehension assessment tool as opposed to patient self-reported scores.","['1 College of Information and Computer Sciences, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, United States.', '2 Department of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts Lowell, Lowell, MA, United States.', '3 Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, United States.', '4 Bedford Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Center for Healthcare Organization and Implementation Research, Bedford, MA, United States.']","John P Lalor, Beverly Woolf, Hong Yu, ",Journal of medical Internet research,2019,MedlinePlus; crowdsourcing; health literacy; information storage and retrieval; natural language processing; psychometrics.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30664453

These methods require minimal or no human intervention and can recursively learn new relational facts-instances in a fully automated and scalable manner. This paper explores the performance of tolerance rough set-based learner with respect to two important issues: scalability and its effect on concept drift, by (1) designing a new version of the semi-supervised tolerance rough set-based pattern learner (TPL 2.0), (2) adapting a tolerance form of rough set methodology to categorize linguistic patterns, and (3) extracting categorical information from a large noisy dataset of crawled web pages. This work demonstrates that the TPL 2.0 learner is promising in terms of precision@30 metric when compared with three benchmark algorithms: Tolerant Pattern Learner 1.0, Fuzzy-Rough Set Pattern Learner, and Coupled Bayesian Sets-based learner.","['1 Sightline Innovation Inc., 136 Market Avenue, Unit 300, Winnipeg, MB, R3B 0P4, Canada.', '2 Department of Applied Computer Science, University of Winnipeg, Winnipeg, Manitoba R3B 2E9, Canada.']","Hoora Rezaei Moghaddam, Sheela Ramanna, ","Patterns (New York, N.Y.)",2020,granular computing; machine learning; named entity recognition; natural language processing; semi-supervised learning; tolerance rough sets.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32835308
278,mRNA Encoding a Bispecific Single Domain Antibody Construct Protects against Influenza A Virus Infection in Mice,"To date, mRNA-based biologics have mainly been developed for prophylactic and therapeutic vaccination to combat infectious diseases or cancer. In the past years, optimization of the characteristics of in vitro transcribed mRNA has led to significant reduction of the inflammatory responses. Thanks to this, mRNA therapeutics have entered the field of passive immunization. Here, we established an mRNA treatment that is based on mRNA that codes for a bispecific single-domain antibody construct that can selectively recruit innate immune cells to cells infected with influenza A virus. The constructs consist of a single-domain antibody that binds to the ectodomain of the conserved influenza A matrix protein 2, while the other single-domain antibody binds to the activating mouse Fcγ receptor IV. Formulating the mRNA into DOTAP (1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane)/cholesterol nanoparticles and delivering these intratracheally to mice allowed the production of the bispecific single-domain antibody in the lungs, and administration of these mRNA-particles prior to influenza A virus infection was associated with a significant reduction in viral titers and a reduced morbidity in mice. Overall, our data provide evidence that the local delivery of mRNA encoding a bispecific single-domain antibody format in the lungs could be a promising pulmonary antiviral prophylactic treatment.","['1 VIB-UGent Center for Medical Biotechnology, VIB, 9000 Ghent, Belgium; Department of Biomedical Molecular Biology, Ghent University, 9000 Ghent, Belgium.', '2 Laboratory of General Biochemistry & Physical Pharmacy, Ghent University, 9000 Ghent, Belgium; Cancer Research Institute Ghent, 9000 Ghent, Belgium.', '3 VIB-UGent Center for Medical Biotechnology, VIB, 9000 Ghent, Belgium; Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology, Ghent University, 9000 Ghent, Belgium.', '4 Laboratory of General Biochemistry & Physical Pharmacy, Ghent University, 9000 Ghent, Belgium; Cancer Research Institute Ghent, 9000 Ghent, Belgium; Laboratory for Molecular and Cellular Therapy, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, 1090 Jette, Belgium.', '5 Upper Airways Research Laboratory, Department of Head and Skin, Ghent University, 9000 Ghent, Belgium.', '6 VIB-UGent Center for Medical Biotechnology, VIB, 9000 Ghent, Belgium; Department of Biomedical Molecular Biology, Ghent University, 9000 Ghent, Belgium; Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology, Ghent University, 9000 Ghent, Belgium.', '7 VIB-UGent Center for Medical Biotechnology, VIB, 9000 Ghent, Belgium; Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology, Ghent University, 9000 Ghent, Belgium.

279,Viromers as carriers for mRNA-mediated expression of therapeutic molecules under inflammatory conditions,"Therapeutic mRNA delivery has been described for several treatment options, such as vaccination and cancer immunotherapy. However, mRNA delivery has to be accompanied by the development and testing of suitable carrier materials due to the instability of mRNAs in human body fluids. In the present study, we investigated the ability of recently developed Viromers to deliver mRNAs in a classical inflammatory setting. We tested mRNAs coding for active components of preclinical (7ND) and approved (sTNF-RII) biologics, in vitro and in vivo. 7ND is an established blocker of the CCR2 axis, whereas sTNF-RII is the active component of the approved drug Etanercept. Viromer/mRNA complexes were transfected into murine macrophages in vitro. Protein expression was analysed using Luciferase reporter expression and mainly identified in spleen, blood and bone marrow in vivo. 7ND-mRNA delivery led to efficient blockage of monocytes infiltration in thioglycolate-induced peritonitis in mice, underlining the ability of Viromers to deliver a therapeutic mRNA cargo without overt toxicity. Therefore, we propose Viromer-based mRNA delivery as a suitable option for the treatment of inflammatory disorders beyond infusion of biological molecules.","['1 Department of Drug Design and Target Validation, Fraunhofer Institute for Cell Therapy and Immunology, Weinbergweg 22, 06120, Halle, Germany.', '2 BioNTech Delivery Technologies GmbH, Weinbergweg 23, 06120, Halle, Germany.', '3 Department of Drug Design and Target Validation, Fraunhofer Institute for Cell Therapy and Immunology, Weinbergweg 22, 06120, Halle, Germany. holger.cynis@izi.fraunhofer.de.']","Edith Jansig, Stefanie Geissler, Vera Rieckmann, Anja Kuenemund, Benjamin Hietel, Mathias Schenk, Sebastian Wussow, Patrick Kreideweiss, Steffen Panzner, Christian Reinsch, Holger Cynis, ",Scientific reports,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32934311
280,Deep Natural Language Processing to Identify Symptom Documentation in Clinical Notes for Patients With Heart Failure Undergoing Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy,"Context:
      
    

    
      Clinicians lack reliable methods to predict which patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) will benefit from cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). Symptom burden may help to predict response, but this information is buried in free-text clinical notes. Natural language processing (NLP) may identify symptoms recorded in the electronic health record and thereby enable this information to inform clinical decisions about the appropriateness of CRT. Objectives:
      
    

    
      To develop, train, and test a deep NLP model that identifies documented symptoms in patients with CHF receiving CRT. Methods:
      
    

    
      We identified a random sample of clinical notes from a cohort of patients with CHF who later received CRT. Investigators labeled documented symptoms as present, absent, and context dependent (pathologic depending on the clinical situation). The algorithm was trained on 80% and fine-tuned parameters on 10% of the notes. We tested the model on the remaining 10%. We compared the model's performance to investigators' annotations using accuracy, precision (positive predictive value), recall (sensitivity), and F1 score (a combined measure of precision and recall). Results:
      
    

    
      Investigators annotated 154 notes (352,157 words) and identified 1340 present, 1300 absent, and 221 context-dependent symptoms. In the test set of 15 notes (35,467 words), the model's accuracy was 99.4% and recall was 66.8%. Precision was 77.6%, and overall F1 score was 71.8. F1 scores for present (70.8) and absent (74.7) symptoms were higher than that for context-dependent symptoms (48.3). Conclusion:

      Nurse concerns documented in nursing notes are important predictors of patient risk of deterioration. Using a standard nursing terminology and inputs from subject-matter experts (SMEs), we aimed to identify and define nurse concern concepts and terms about patient deterioration, which can be used to support subsequent automated tasks, such as natural language processing and risk predication. Methods:
      
    

    
      Group consensus meetings with nurse SMEs were held to identify nursing concerns by grading Clinical Care Classification (CCC) system concepts based on clinical knowledge. Next, a fundamental lexicon was built placing selected CCC concepts into a framework of entities and seed terms to extend CCC granularity. Results:
      
    

    
      A total of 29 CCC concepts were selected as reflecting nurse concerns. From these, 111 entities and 586 seed terms were generated into a fundamental lexicon. Nursing concern concepts differed across settings (intensive care units versus non-intensive care units) and unit types (medicine versus surgery units). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The CCC concepts were useful for representing nursing concern as they encompass a nursing-centric conceptual framework and are practical in lexicon construction. It enabled the codification of nursing concerns for deteriorating patients at a standardized conceptual level. The boundary of selected CCC concepts and lexicons were determined by the SMEs. The fundamental lexicon offers more granular terms that can be identified and processed in an automated fashion.","[""1 Division of General Internal Medicine and Primary Care, Brigham & Women's Hospital, Boston, USA; Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA.

284,Escape from nonsense-mediated decay associates with anti-tumor immunogenicity,"Frameshift insertion/deletions (fs-indels) are an infrequent but highly immunogenic mutation subtype. Although fs-indels are degraded through the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway, we hypothesise that some fs-indels escape degradation and elicit anti-tumor immune responses. Using allele-specific expression analysis, expressed fs-indels are enriched in genomic positions predicted to escape NMD, and associated with higher protein expression, consistent with degradation escape (NMD-escape). Across four independent melanoma cohorts, NMD-escape mutations are significantly associated with clinical-benefit to checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) therapy (Pmeta = 0.0039). NMD-escape mutations are additionally found to associate with clinical-benefit in the low-TMB setting. Furthermore, in an adoptive cell therapy treated melanoma cohort, NMD-escape mutation count is the most significant biomarker associated with clinical-benefit. Analysis of functional T cell reactivity screens from personalized vaccine studies shows direct evidence of fs-indel derived neoantigens eliciting immune response, particularly those with highly elongated neo open reading frames. NMD-escape fs-indels represent an attractive target for biomarker optimisation and immunotherapy design.","['1 Cancer Evolution and Genome Instability Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Rd, London, NW1 1AT, UK. k.litchfield@ucl.ac.uk.', ""2 Cancer Research UK Lung Cancer Centre of Excellence, University College London Cancer Institute, Paul O'Gorman Building, 72 Huntley Street, London, WC1E 6DD, UK. k.litchfield@ucl.ac.uk."", ""3 Cancer Research UK Lung Cancer Centre of Excellence, University College London Cancer Institute, Paul O'Gorman Building, 72 Huntley Street, London, WC1E 6DD, UK."", ""4 Cancer Immunology Unit, Research Department of Haematology, University College London Cancer Institute, Paul O'Gorman Building, 72 Huntley Street, London, WC1E 6BT, UK."", '5 Cancer Evolution and Genome Instability Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Rd, London, NW1 1AT, UK.', '6 Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Division of Solid Tumor Oncology, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, and Parker Center for Cancer Immunotherapy, 885 2nd Avenue, New York, NY, 10017, USA.', '7 Mass Spectrometry Proteomics, The Francis Crick Institute, London, NW1 1AT, UK.', '8 Faculty of Medicine, Division of Oncology and Pathology, Department of Clinical Sciences Lund, Lund University, Scheelegatan 2, Medicon Village, 22185, Lund, Sweden.', '9 Center for Cancer Immune Therapy, Department of Oncology, Copenhagen University Hospital Herlev, Borgmester Ib Juuls Vej 1, 2730, Herlev, Denmark.', '10 Bill Lyons Informatics Centre, University College London Cancer Institute, London, WC1E 6DD, UK.', '11 Renal and Skin Units, The Royal Marsden Hospital, London, SW3 6JJ, UK.', '12 Renal and Skin Units, The Royal Marsden Hospital, London, SW3 6JJ, UK. samra.turajlic@crick.ac.uk.', '13 Cancer Dynamics Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Rd, London, NW1 1AT, UK. samra.turajlic@crick.ac.uk.', '14 Cancer Evolution and Genome Instability Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Rd, London, NW1 1AT, UK. charles.swanton@crick.ac.uk.', ""15 Cancer Research UK Lung Cancer Centre of Excellence, University College London Cancer Institute, Paul O'Gorman Building, 72 Huntley Street, London, WC1E 6DD, UK. charles.swanton@crick.ac.uk."", '16 Department of Medical Oncology, University College London Hospitals, 235 Euston Rd, Fitzrovia, London, NW1 2BU, UK. charles.swanton@crick.ac.uk.']","Kevin Litchfield, James L Reading, Emilia L Lim, Hang Xu, Po Liu, Maise Al-Bakir, Yien Ning Sophia Wong, Andrew Rowan, Samuel A Funt, Taha Merghoub, David Perkins, Martin Lauss, Inge Marie Svane, Göran Jönsson, Javier Herrero, James Larkin, Sergio A Quezada, Matthew D Hellmann, Samra Turajlic, Charles Swanton, ",Nature communications,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32733040
285,Messenger RNA therapy for rare genetic metabolic diseases,"Decades of intense research in molecular biology and biochemistry are fructifying in the emergence of therapeutic messenger RNAs (mRNA) as a new class of drugs. Synthetic mRNAs can be sequence optimised to improve translatability into proteins, as well as chemically modified to reduce immunogenicity and increase chemical stability using naturally occurring uridine modifications. These structural improvements, together with the development of safe and efficient vehicles that preserve mRNA integrity in circulation and allow targeted intracellular delivery, have paved the way for mRNA-based therapeutics. Indeed, mRNAs formulated into biodegradable lipid nanoparticles are currently being tested in preclinical and clinical studies for multiple diseases including cancer immunotherapy and vaccination for infectious diseases. An emerging application of mRNAs is the supplementation of proteins that are not expressed or are not functional in a regulated and tissue-specific manner. This so-called 'protein replacement therapy' could represent a solution for genetic metabolic diseases currently lacking effective treatments. Here we summarise this new class of drugs and discuss the preclinical evidence supporting the potential of liver-mediated mRNA therapy for three rare genetic conditions: methylmalonic acidaemia, acute intermittent porphyria and ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency.","['1 Immunology and Immunotherapy Program, Centro de Investigación Médica Aplicada (Cima), University of Navarra, Pamplona, Navarra, Spain.', '2 Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Cáncer, CIBERonc, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.', '3 Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria de Navarra IdiSNA, Pamplona, Spain.', '4 Moderna Therapeutics, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', '5 Hepatology Program, CIMA, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Navarra, Spain.', '6 Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Enfermedades Hepáticas y Digestivas, CIBERehd, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.']","Pedro Berraondo, Paolo G V Martini, Matias A Avila, Antonio Fontanellas, ",Gut,2019 Jul,genetics; liver metabolism; molecular biology.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30796097
286,Ex vivo pulsed dendritic cell vaccination against cancer,"As the most powerful antigen-presenting cell type, dendritic cells (DCs) can induce potent antigen-specific immune responses in vivo, hence becoming optimal cell population for vaccination purposes. DCs can be derived ex vivo in quantity and manipulated extensively to be endowed with adequate immune-stimulating capacity. After pulsing with cancer antigens in various ways, the matured DCs are administrated back into the patient. DCs home to lymphoid organs to present antigens to and activate specific lymphocytes that react to a given cancer. Ex vivo pulsed DC vaccines have been vigorously investigated for decades, registering encouraging results in relevant immunotherapeutic clinical trials, while facing some solid challenges. With more details in DC biology understood, new theory proposed, and novel technology introduced (featuring recently emerged mRNA vaccine technology), it is becoming increasingly likely that ex vivo pulsed DC vaccine will fulfill its potential in cancer immunotherapy.","['1 State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, and Collaborative Innovation Center for Biotherapy, Chengdu, 610041, China.', '2 Stem Cell and Tissue Engineering Research Center, Guizhou Medical University/Key Laboratory of Adult Stem Cell Transformation Research, Department of Immunology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Guiyang, 550004, China.', '3 State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, and Collaborative Innovation Center for Biotherapy, Chengdu, 610041, China. songxr@scu.edu.cn.']","Yang-Zhuo Gu, Xing Zhao, Xiang-Rong Song, ",Acta pharmacologica Sinica,2020 Jul,DC vaccination; T-cell activation; cancer antigens; cancer immunotherapy; dendritic cells; mRNA-pulsed DC vaccines; tumor microenvironment.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32366940
287,Leveraging Contextual Information in Extracting Long Distance Relations from Clinical Notes,"Relation extraction from biomedical text is important for clinical decision support applications. In post-marketing pharmacovigilance, for example, Adverse Drug Events (ADE) relate medical problems to the drugs that caused them and were the focus of two recent shared challenges. While good results were reported, there was a room for improvement. Here, we studied two new improved methods for relation extraction: (1) State-of-the-art deep learning contextual representation model called BERT, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers; (2) Selection of negative training samples based on the ""near-miss"" hypothesis (the Edge sampling). We used the datasets from MADE and N2C2 Task-2 for performance evaluation. BERT and Edge together improved performance of ADE and Reason (indication) relations extraction by 6.4-6.7 absolute percentage (and error rate reduction of 24%-28%). ADE and Reason relations contained longer text between the entities, which BERT and Edge were able to leverage to achieve the performance improvement. While the performance improvement for medication attribute relations was smaller in absolute percentages, error rate reduction was still considerable.","['1 Biomedical Informatics, College of Health Solutions Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ.']","Hong Guan, Murthy Devarakonda, ",AMIA ...

288,Pharmacoepidemiology and Big Data Analytics: Challenges and Opportunities when Moving towards Precision Medicine,"Pharmacoepidemiology is the study of the safety and effectiveness of medications following market approval. The increased availability and size of healthcare utilization databases allows for the study of rare adverse events, sub-group analyses, and long-term follow-up. These datasets are large, including thousands of patient records spanning multiple years of observation, and representative of real-world clinical practice. Thus, one of the main advantages is the possibility to study the real-world safety and effectiveness of medications in uncontrolled environments. Due to the large size (volume), structure (variety), and availability (velocity) of observational healthcare databases there is a large interest in the application of natural language processing and machine learning, including the development of novel models to detect drug-drug interactions, patient phenotypes, and outcome prediction. This report will provide an overview of the current challenges in pharmacoepidemiology and where machine learning applications may be useful for filling the gap.","['1 ETH Zurich, Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences, Department of Chemistry and Applied Biosciences, HCI H 407, Vladimir-Prelog-Weg 4/10, CH-8093 Zurich;, Email: andrea.burden@pharma.ethz.ch.']","Andrea M Burden, ",Chimia,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31883553
289,Association of Online Consumer Reviews of Skilled Nursing Facilities With Patient Rehospitalization Rates,"Importance:
      
    

    
      There are areas of skilled nursing facility (SNF) experience of importance to the public that are not currently included in public reporting initiatives on SNF quality. Whether patients, hospitals, and payers can leverage the information available from unsolicited online reviews to reduce avoidable rehospitalizations from SNFs is unknown. Objectives:
      
    

    
      To assess the association between rehospitalization rates and online ratings of SNFs; to compare the association of rehospitalization with ratings from a review website vs Medicare Nursing Home Compare (NHC) ratings; and to identify specific topics consistently reported in reviews of SNFs with the highest vs lowest rehospitalization rates using natural language processing. Design, setting, and participants:
      
    

    
      A retrospective cross-sectional study of 1536 SNFs with online reviews on Yelp (a website that allows consumers to rate and review businesses and services, scored on a 1- to 5-star rating scale, with 1 star indicating the lowest rating and 5 stars indicating the highest rating) posted between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2018. The combined data set included 1536 SNFs with 8548 online reviews, NHC ratings, and readmission rates. Main outcomes and measures:
      
    

    
      A mean rating from the review website was calculated through the end of each year. Risk-standardized rehospitalization rates were obtained from NHC. Linear regression was used to measure the association between the rehospitalization rate of a SNF and the online ratings. Natural language processing was used to identify topics associated with reviews of SNFs in the top and bottom quintiles of rehospitalization rates. Results:
      
    

    
      The 1536 SNFs in the sample had a median of 6 reviews (interquartile range, 3-13 reviews), with a mean (SD) review website rating of 2.7 (1.1). The SNFs with the highest rating on both the review website and NHC had 2.0% lower rehospitalization rates compared with the SNFs with the lowest rating on both websites (21.3%; 95% CI, 20.7%-21.8%; vs 23.3%; 95% CI, 22.7%-24.0%; P = .04). Compared with the NHC ratings alone, review website ratings were associated with an additional 0.4% of the variation in rehospitalization rates across SNFs (adjusted R2 = 0.009 vs adjusted R2 = 0.013; P = .003). Thematic analysis of qualitative comments on the review website for SNFs with high vs low rehospitalization rates identified several areas of importance to the reviewers, such as the quality of physical infrastructure and equipment, staff attitudes and communication with caregivers. Conclusions and relevance:
      
    

    
      Skilled nursing facilities with the best rating on both a review website and NHC had slightly lower rehospitalization rates than SNFs with the best rating on NHC alone. However, there was marked variation in the volume of reviews, and many SNF characteristics were underrepresented. Further refinement of the review process is warranted.","['1 Perelman School of Medicine, Division of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.', '2 Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.', '3 Center for Digital Health, University of Pennsylvania Health System, Philadelphia.', '4 University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.', '5 University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing, Philadelphia.', '6 Corporal Michael J.

290,Immunotherapy in prostate cancer: current state and future perspectives,"Metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (PCa) remains an incurable entity. In the era of immunotherapy, the complex PCa microenvironment poses a unique challenge to the successful application of this class of agents. However, in the last decade, a tremendous effort has been made to explore this field of therapeutics. In this review, the physiology of the cancer immunity cycle is highlighted in the context of the prostate tumor microenvironment, and the current evidence for use of various classes of immunotherapy agents including vaccines (dendritic cell based, viral vector based and DNA/mRNA based), immune checkpoint inhibitors, Chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy, antibody-mediated radioimmunotherapy, antibody drug conjugates, and bispecific antibodies, is consolidated. Finally, the future directions for combinatorial approaches to combat PCa are discussed.","['1 Department of Internal Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine, Mount Sinai Morningside and West Hospital, New York, NY, 10019, USA.', '2 Department of Internal Medicine, Allegheny General Hospital, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', '3 Department of Urology, Icahn School of Medicine, Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, NY, USA.']","Shivani Handa, Bandhul Hans, Shokhi Goel, Hafis O Bashorun, Zach Dovey, Ashutosh Tewari, ",Therapeutic advances in urology,2020,CAR-T cell; Prostate cancer; Sipuleucel-T; adoptive cell therapy; cancer vaccines; cancer-immunity cycle; immune checkpoint inhibitor; immunotherapy; metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer; radioimmunotherapy.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32952615
291,"Comparison of ISG15, IL28B and USP18 mRNA levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of chronic hepatitis B virus infected patients and healthy individuals","Aim:
      
    

    
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the expression level of Interferon-stimulated Gene 15 (ISG15), Interleukin28B (IL28B) or IFN-lambda-3 and Ubiquitin specific peptidase 18 (USP18) genes in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) of patients with chronic active and inactive hepatitis B in comparison with healthy individuals. Background:
      
    

    
      Despite the presence of the vaccine for hepatitis B virus (HBV), it remains a public health challenge. The effort to uncover the immune genes attributed to infection outcome is going through. Methods:
      
    

    
      This Cross-sectional study was conducted on hepatitis B infected patients that were admitted to the Clinic of Liver diseases, Shiraz, January-November 2016. Patients were divided into two groups including active and inactive chronic regarding relevant World Gastroenterology Organization Global Guideline. They were mono-infected with HBV, and HCV or HIV co-infection was excluded from the study. Gene expression analysis was performed on fresh PBMCs samples with the help of Real-time PCR method. Results:
      
    

    
      Interleukin 28B gene expression showed no statistically significant difference between the three studied groups (P>0.05). The expression level of ISG15 was significantly higher in the healthy control group compared to active (P= 0.0068) and inactive chronic subjects (P<0.0001). Similarly, USP18 expression level in the control group was also significantly higher compared to the active (P= 0.0228) and inactive chronic patients (P=0. 0226). Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The results of this study showed that the expression level of ISG15 and USP18 but not IL28B were higher in healthy individuals than in those infected with HBV. This difference expression may highlight the role of ISG15 and USP18 in the immune-related mechanism of HBV infection.","['1 Department of Bacteriology and Virology, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', '2 Gastroenterohepatology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', '3 Institute for Cancer Research, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.']","Seyed Mohammad Ali Hashemi, Jamal Sarvari, Mohammad Reza Fattahi, Razieh Dowran, Amin Ramezani, Seyed Younes Hosseini, ",Gastroenterology and hepatology from bed to bench,Winter 2019,Hepatitis B viruses; IFN-lambda-3 protein; ISG15 protein; Immunity; USP18.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30949318
292,Comprehensive Word-Level Classification of Screening Mammography Reports Using a Neural Network Sequence Labeling Approach,"Radiology reports contain a large amount of potentially valuable unstructured data. Recently, neural networks have been employed to perform classification of radiology reports over a few classes at the document level. The success of neural networks in sequence-labeling problems such as named entity recognition and part of speech tagging suggests that they could be used to classify radiology report text with greater granularity. We employed a neural network architecture to comprehensively classify mammography report text at the word level using a sequence labeling approach. Two radiologists devised a comprehensive classification system for screening mammography reports. Each word in each report was manually categorized by a radiologist into one of 33 categories according to the classification system. Tagged words referencing the same finding were grouped into unique sets. We pre-labeled reports with a rule-based algorithm and then manually edited these annotations for 6705 screening mammography reports (25.1%, 66.8%, and 8.1% BI-RADS 0, 1, and 2, respectively). A combined convolutional and recurrent neural network model was used to label words in each sentence of the individual reports. A siamese recurrent neural network was then used to group findings into sets. Performance of the neural network-based method was compared to a rule-based algorithm and a conditional random field (CRF) model. Global accuracy (percentage of documents where all word tags were predicted correctly) and keyword accuracy (percentage of all words that were labeled correctly, excluding words tagged as unimportant) were calculated on an unseen 519 report test set. Two-tailed t tests were used to assess differences between algorithm performance, and p < 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. The neural network-based approach showed significantly higher global accuracy compared to both the rule-based algorithm (88.3 vs 57.0%, p < 0.001) and the CRF model (88.3% vs. 75.8%, p < 0.001). The neural network also showed significantly higher keyword level accuracy compared to the rule-based algorithm (95.5% vs. 80.9% p < 0.001) and CRF model (95.5% vs. 76.9%, p < 0.001). We demonstrate the potential of neural networks to accurately perform word-level multilabel classification of free text radiology reports across 33 classes, thus showing the utility of a sequence labeling approach to NLP of radiology reports. We found that a neural network classifier outperforms a rule-based algorithm and a CRF classifier for comprehensive multilabel classification of free text screening mammography reports at the word level. By approaching radiology report classification as a sequence-labeling problem, we demonstrate the ability of neural networks to extract data from free text radiology reports at a level of granularity not previously reported.","['1 Department of Radiology, Duke University Medical Center, 2301 Erwin Road, Box 3808, Durham, NC, 27710, USA.

293,High-throughput phenotyping with electronic medical record data using a common semi-supervised approach (PheCAP),"Phenotypes are the foundation for clinical and genetic studies of disease risk and outcomes. The growth of biobanks linked to electronic medical record (EMR) data has both facilitated and increased the demand for efficient, accurate, and robust approaches for phenotyping millions of patients. Challenges to phenotyping with EMR data include variation in the accuracy of codes, as well as the high level of manual input required to identify features for the algorithm and to obtain gold standard labels. To address these challenges, we developed PheCAP, a high-throughput semi-supervised phenotyping pipeline. PheCAP begins with data from the EMR, including structured data and information extracted from the narrative notes using natural language processing (NLP). The standardized steps integrate automated procedures, which reduce the level of manual input, and machine learning approaches for algorithm training. PheCAP itself can be executed in 1-2 d if all data are available; however, the timing is largely dependent on the chart review stage, which typically requires at least 2 weeks. The final products of PheCAP include a phenotype algorithm, the probability of the phenotype for all patients, and a phenotype classification (yes or no).","['1 Department of Biostatistics, Harvard T.H.

295,Artificial Intelligence-Based Conversational Agents for Chronic Conditions: Systematic Literature Review,"Background:
      
    

    
      A rising number of conversational agents or chatbots are equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) architecture. They are increasingly prevalent in health care applications such as those providing education and support to patients with chronic diseases, one of the leading causes of death in the 21st century. AI-based chatbots enable more effective and frequent interactions with such patients. Objective:
      
    

    
      The goal of this systematic literature review is to review the characteristics, health care conditions, and AI architectures of AI-based conversational agents designed specifically for chronic diseases. Methods:
      
    

    
      We conducted a systematic literature review using PubMed MEDLINE, EMBASE, PyscInfo, CINAHL, ACM Digital Library, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science. We applied a predefined search strategy using the terms ""conversational agent,"" ""healthcare,"" ""artificial intelligence,"" and their synonyms. We updated the search results using Google alerts, and screened reference lists for other relevant articles. We included primary research studies that involved the prevention, treatment, or rehabilitation of chronic diseases, involved a conversational agent, and included any kind of AI architecture. Two independent reviewers conducted screening and data extraction, and Cohen kappa was used to measure interrater agreement.A narrative approach was applied for data synthesis. Results:
      
    

    
      The literature search found 2052 articles, out of which 10 papers met the inclusion criteria. The small number of identified studies together with the prevalence of quasi-experimental studies (n=7) and prevailing prototype nature of the chatbots (n=7) revealed the immaturity of the field. The reported chatbots addressed a broad variety of chronic diseases (n=6), showcasing a tendency to develop specialized conversational agents for individual chronic conditions. However, there lacks comparison of these chatbots within and between chronic diseases. In addition, the reported evaluation measures were not standardized, and the addressed health goals showed a large range. Together, these study characteristics complicated comparability and open room for future research. While natural language processing represented the most used AI technique (n=7) and the majority of conversational agents allowed for multimodal interaction (n=6), the identified studies demonstrated broad heterogeneity, lack of depth of reported AI techniques and systems, and inconsistent usage of taxonomy of the underlying AI software, further aggravating comparability and generalizability of study results. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The literature on AI-based conversational agents for chronic conditions is scarce and mostly consists of quasi-experimental studies with chatbots in prototype stage that use natural language processing and allow for multimodal user interaction. Future research could profit from evidence-based evaluation of the AI-based conversational agents and comparison thereof within and between different chronic health conditions. Besides increased comparability, the quality of chatbots developed for specific chronic conditions and their subsequent impact on the target patients could be enhanced by more structured development and standardized evaluation processes.","['1 Department of Management, Technology, and Economics, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', '2 Future Health Technologies programme, Campus for Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise, Singapore-ETH Centre, Singapore.']","Theresa Schachner, Roman Keller, Florian V Wangenheim, ",Journal of medical Internet research,2020,artificial intelligence; chatbots; chronic diseases; conversational agents; healthcare; systematic literature review.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32924957

Here we present an ionizable lipid nanoparticle (iLNP) based on iBL0713 lipid for in vitro and in vivo expression of desired proteins using codon-optimized mRNAs. mRNAs encoding luciferase or erythropoietin (EPO) were prepared by in vitro transcription and formulated with proposed iLNP, to form iLP171/mRNA formulations. It was revealed that both luciferase and EPO proteins were successfully expressed by human hepatocellular carcinoma cells and hepatocytes. The maximum amount of protein expression was found at 6 h post-administration. The expression efficiency of EPO with codon-optimized mRNA was significantly higher than that of unoptimized mRNA.

298,Functions and Potential Applications of Circular RNAs in Cancer Stem Cells,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) were discovered in the 1970s, but they have drawn increasing attention in recent years. Currently, we know that circRNAs are not ""wrongly spliced"" during transcription but play important roles in the initiation and development of various diseases, including cancers. Recently, a growing number of studies have suggested that cancer stem cells (CSCs) may contribute to the origination and maintenance of cancers. This review briefly introduces the major functions of circRNAs, including interacting with other noncoding RNAs, competing with pre-mRNA splicing, binding with proteins to form a scaffold, promoting protein nuclear translocation and even translating proteins in a cap-independent manner. Furthermore, we describe the regulatory mechanism of circRNAs in CSC phenotypes and discuss the potential clinical applications of circRNAs in CSC-targeted therapy, including functioning as new biomarkers, acting as vaccines and breaking the therapeutic resistance of CSCs. Finally, we discuss the major limitations and challenges in the field, which will be beneficial for the future clinical use of circRNAs.","['1 Hunan Provincial Tumor Hospital and the Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Xiangya Medical School, Central South University, Changsha, China.', '2 The Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis of the Chinese Ministry of Health, The Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Cancer Invasion of the Chinese Ministry of Education, Cancer Research Institute, Central South University, Changsha, China.', '3 The Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.', '4 The Affiliated Zhuzhou Hospital Xiangya Medical College, Central South University, Zhuzhou, China.']","Ziyang Feng, Shujuan Meng, Hecheng Zhou, Zihao Xu, Ying Tang, Peiyao Li, Changhong Liu, Yongkai Huang, Minghua Wu, ",Frontiers in oncology,2019,biomarker; cancer stem cell; circRNAs; therapy resistance; vaccine.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31263676
299,Identifying lupus patients in electronic health records: Development and validation of machine learning algorithms and application of rule-based algorithms,"Objective:
      
    

    
      To utilize electronic health records (EHRs) to study SLE, algorithms are needed to accurately identify these patients. We used machine learning to generate data-driven SLE EHR algorithms and assessed performance of existing rule-based algorithms. Methods:
      
    

    
      We randomly selected subjects with ≥ 1 SLE ICD-9/10 codes from our EHR and identified gold standard definite and probable SLE cases by chart review, based on 1997 ACR or 2012 SLICC Classification Criteria. From a training set, we extracted coded and narrative concepts using natural language processing and generated algorithms using penalized logistic regression to classify definite or definite/probable SLE. We assessed predictive characteristics in internal and external cohort validations. We also tested performance characteristics of published rule-based algorithms with pre-specified permutations of ICD-9 codes, laboratory tests and medications in our EHR. Results:
      
    

    
      At a specificity of 97%, our machine learning coded algorithm for definite SLE had 90% positive predictive value (PPV) and 64% sensitivity and for definite/probable SLE, 92% PPV and 47% sensitivity. In the external validation, at 97% specificity, the definite/probable algorithm had 94% PPV and 60% sensitivity. Adding NLP concepts did not improve performance metrics. The PPVs of published rule-based algorithms ranged from 45-79% in our EHR. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Our machine learning SLE algorithms performed well in internal and external validation. Rule-based SLE algorithms did not transport as well to our EHR. Unique EHR characteristics, clinical practices and research goals regarding the desired sensitivity and specificity of the case definition must be considered when applying algorithms to identify SLE patients.","['1 Division of Rheumatology, Allergy, and Immunology, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 55 Fruit Street, Bulfinch 165, Boston, MA 02114, United States.

300,Normalizing Spontaneous Reports Into MedDRA: Some Experiments With MagiCoder,"Text normalization into medical dictionaries is useful to support clinical tasks. A typical setting is pharmacovigilance (PV). The manual detection of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in narrative reports is time consuming and natural language processing (NLP) provides a concrete help to PV experts. In this paper, we carry out experiments for testing performances of MagiCoder, an NLP application designed to extract MedDRA terms from narrative clinical text. Given a narrative description, MagiCoder proposes an automatic encoding. The pharmacologist reviews, (possibly) corrects, and then, validates the solution. This drastically reduces the time needed for the validation of reports with respect to a completely manual encoding. In previous work, we mainly tested MagiCoder performances on Italian written spontaneous reports. In this paper, we include some new features, change the experiment design, and carry on more tests about MagiCoder. Moreover, we do a change of language, moving to English documents. In particular, we tested MagiCoder on the CADEC dataset, a corpus of manually annotated posts about ADRs collected from the social media.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Carlo Combi, Margherita Zorzi, Gabriele Pozzani, Elena Arzenton, Ugo Moretti, ",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,2019 Jan,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30059326
301,Automated Detection of Radiology Reports that Require Follow-up Imaging Using Natural Language Processing Feature Engineering and Machine Learning Classification,"While radiologists regularly issue follow-up recommendations, our preliminary research has shown that anywhere from 35 to 50% of patients who receive follow-up recommendations for findings of possible cancer on abdominopelvic imaging do not return for follow-up. As such, they remain at risk for adverse outcomes related to missed or delayed cancer diagnosis. In this study, we develop an algorithm to automatically detect free text radiology reports that have a follow-up recommendation using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models. The data set used in this study consists of 6000 free text reports from the author's institution. NLP techniques are used to engineer 1500 features, which include the most informative unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams in the training corpus after performing tokenization and Porter stemming. On this data set, we train naive Bayes, decision tree, and maximum entropy models. The decision tree model, with an F1 score of 0.458 and accuracy of 0.862, outperforms both the naive Bayes (F1 score of 0.381) and maximum entropy (F1 score of 0.387) models. The models were analyzed to determine predictive features, with term frequency of n-grams such as ""renal neoplasm"" and ""evalu with enhanc"" being most predictive of a follow-up recommendation. Key to maximizing performance was feature engineering that extracts predictive information and appropriate selection of machine learning algorithms based on the feature set.","['1 Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, 801 S 24th St #3, Philadelphia, PA, 19146, USA. robert.lou@pennmedicine.upenn.edu.', '2 Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']","Robert Lou, Darco Lalevic, Charles Chambers, Hanna M Zafar, Tessa S Cook, ",Journal of digital imaging,2020 Feb,Artificial intelligence; Binary classification; Follow-up; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Structured reporting.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31482317

Reports are also expected to have secondary uses (e.g., clinical research and the development of decision support systems). For secondary use, it is necessary to extract information from the report and organize it in a structured format. Our goal is to build an application to transform radiology reports written in a free-text form into a structured format. To this end, we propose an end-to-end method that consists of three elements. First, we built a neural network model to extract clinical information from the reports. We experimented on a dataset of chest X-ray reports. Second, we transformed the extracted information into a structured format. Finally, we built a tool that enabled the transformation of terms in reports to standard forms. Through our end-to-end method, we could obtain a structured radiology dataset that was easy to access for secondary use.","['1 Department of Medical Informatics, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine.']","Kento Sugimoto, Toshihiro Takeda, Shoya Wada, Asuka Yamahata, Shozo Konishi, Shiro Manabe, Yasushi Matsumura, ",Studies in health technology and informatics,2020,Information Extraction; Natural Language Processing; Radiology Report.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32570375
303,Trove: Ontology-driven weak supervision for medical entity classification,"Motivation:
      
    

    
      Recognizing named entities (NER) and their associated attributes like negation are core tasks in natural language processing. However, manually labeling data for entity tasks is time consuming and expensive, creating barriers to using machine learning in new medical applications. Weakly supervised learning, which automatically builds imperfect training sets from low cost, less accurate labeling rules, offers a potential solution. Medical ontologies are compelling sources for generating labels, however combining multiple ontologies without ground truth data creates challenges due to label noise introduced by conflicting entity definitions. Key questions remain on the extent to which weakly supervised entity classification can be automated using ontologies, or how much additional task-specific rule engineering is required for state-of-the-art performance. Also unclear is how pre-trained language models, such as BioBERT, improve the ability to generalize from imperfectly labeled data. Results:
      
    

    
      We present Trove, a framework for weakly supervised entity classification using medical ontologies. We report state-of-the-art, weakly supervised performance on two NER benchmark datasets and establish new baselines for two entity classification tasks in clinical text. We perform within an average of 3.5 F1 points (4.2%) of NER classifiers trained with hand-labeled data. Automatically learning label source accuracies to correct for label noise provided an average improvement of 3.9 F1 points. BioBERT provided an average improvement of 0.9 F1 points. We measure the impact of combining large numbers of ontologies and present a case study on rapidly building classifiers for COVID-19 clinical tasks. Our framework demonstrates how a wide range of medical entity classifiers can be quickly constructed using weak supervision and without requiring manually-labeled training data.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Jason A Fries, Ethan Steinberg, Saelig Khattar, Scott L Fleming, Jose Posada, Alison Callahan, Nigam H Shah, ",ArXiv,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32793768
304,Transparent Reporting on Research Using Unstructured Electronic Health Record Data to Generate 'Real World' Evidence of Comparative Effectiveness and Safety,"Research that makes secondary use of administrative and clinical healthcare databases is increasingly influential for regulatory, reimbursement, and other healthcare decision-making. Consequently, there are numerous guidance documents on reporting for studies that use 'real-world' data captured in administrative claims and electronic health record (EHR) databases. These guidance documents are intended to improve transparency, reproducibility, and the ability to evaluate validity and relevance of design and analysis decisions. However, existing guidance does not differentiate between structured and unstructured information contained in EHRs, registries, or other healthcare data sources. While unstructured text is convenient and readily interpretable in clinical practice, it can be difficult to use for investigation of causal questions, e.g., comparative effectiveness and safety, until data have been cleaned and algorithms applied to extract relevant information to structured fields for analysis. The goal of this paper is to increase transparency for healthcare decision makers and causal inference researchers by providing general recommendations for reporting on steps taken to make unstructured text-based data usable for comparative effectiveness and safety research. These recommendations are designed to be used as an adjunct for existing reporting guidance. They are intended to provide sufficient context and supporting information for causal inference studies involving use of natural language processing- or machine learning-derived data fields, so that researchers, reviewers, and decision makers can be confident in their ability to evaluate the validity and relevance of derived measures for exposures, inclusion/exclusion criteria, covariates, and outcomes for the causal question of interest.","[""1 Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, 1620 Tremont St Suite 303, Boston, MA, 02120, USA. swang1@bwh.harvard.edu."", '2 Division of Epidemiology, Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', '3 VA Salt Lake City Health Care System, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', ""4 Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, 1620 Tremont St Suite 303, Boston, MA, 02120, USA."", '5 Department of Population Medicine, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', '6 Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD, USA.', '7 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, London, UK.', ""8 Department of General Internal Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", '9 The National Healthcare Institute (ZIN), Diemen, The Netherlands.', '10 Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Clinical Pharmacology, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', '11 Pfizer, London, UK.']","Shirley V Wang, Olga V Patterson, Joshua J Gagne, Jeffrey S Brown, Robert Ball, Pall Jonsson, Adam Wright, Li Zhou, Wim Goettsch, Andrew Bate, ",Drug safety,2019 Nov,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31452075
305,Optimizing for Measure of Performance in Max-Margin Parsing,"Many learning tasks in the field of natural language processing including sequence tagging, sequence segmentation, and syntactic parsing have been successfully approached by means of structured prediction methods. An appealing property of the corresponding training algorithms is their ability to integrate the loss function of interest into the optimization process improving the final results according to the chosen measure of performance. Here, we focus on the task of constituency parsing and show how to optimize the model for the F1 -score in the max-margin framework of a structural support vector machine (SVM). For reasons of computational efficiency, it is a common approach to binarize the corresponding grammar before training. Unfortunately, this introduces a bias during the training procedure as the corresponding loss function is evaluated on the binary representation, while the resulting performance is measured on the original unbinarized trees. Here, we address this problem by extending the inference procedure presented by Bauer et al. Specifically, we propose an algorithmic modification that allows evaluating the loss on the unbinarized trees. The new approach properly models the loss function of interest resulting in better prediction accuracy and still benefits from the computational efficiency due to binarized representation. The presented idea can be easily transferred to other structured loss functions.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Alexander Bauer, Shinichi Nakajima, Nico Gornitz, Klaus-Robert Muller, ",IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems,2020 Jul,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31494564

However, unlike the mature deployment of deep learning in computer vision and natural language processing, its development in molecular modeling and simulations is still at an early stage, largely because the inductive biases of molecules are completely different from those of images or texts. Footed on these differences, we first reviewed the limitations of traditional deep learning models from the perspective of molecular physics, and wrapped up some relevant technical advancement at the interface between molecular modeling and deep learning. We do not focus merely on the ever more complex neural network models, instead, we introduce various useful concepts and ideas brought by modern deep learning. We hope that transacting these ideas into molecular modeling will create new opportunities. For this purpose, we summarized several representative applications, ranging from supervised to unsupervised and reinforcement learning, and discussed their connections with the emerging trends in deep learning. Finally, we outlook promising directions which may help address the existing issues in the current framework of deep molecular modeling.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Jun Zhang, Yao-Kun Lei, Zhen Zhang, Junhan Chang, Maodong Li, Xu Han, Lijiang Yang, Yi Isaac Yang, Yi Qin Gao, ",The journal of physical chemistry.

307,Using Citation Context to Improve the Retrieval of Research Article from Cancer Research Journals,"Objective: In recent years, citation analysis tools provide many devices for finding or computing the citation score or impact factor for journals. It is important for the researchers to identify good journals for collecting research ideas discussed. A journal with a good impact factor value is preferably referred to by many researchers. In this research work, the author proposes a system for ranking journals on the basis of ideas and results cited in other papers. Methods: The work involves the cited content extractor for extracting the descriptive features mentioned about the cited paper. The cited content refers to the content in the article written by a citing paper and relating to the cited paper. The ranking system uses a citation score estimator for computing the overall weight of the descriptive cited content relating to a specific paper in the citing papers. The journal ranking system performs classification of the citation content with the evaluation of a citation score. The work that involves the citation content is classified under different categories as positively cited, negatively cited or neutral and unrelated. Results: Then the computed citation score is used for ranking the dealing with research on cancer research journals. The results of the ranking journals indicate that the particular ranked journal has been cited in the literature of many journals with a good descriptive content. Journal ranking system can be considered as a well-organized tool for ranking the cancer research scientific journal based on citation content and citation counting.

308,"Deep Learning on Big, Sparse, Behavioral Data","The outstanding performance of deep learning (DL) for computer vision and natural language processing has fueled increased interest in applying these algorithms more broadly in both research and practice. This study investigates the application of DL techniques to classification of large sparse behavioral data-which has become ubiquitous in the age of big data collection. We report on an extensive search through DL architecture variants and compare the predictive performance of DL with that of carefully regularized logistic regression (LR), which previously (and repeatedly) has been found to be the most accurate machine learning technique generally for sparse behavioral data. At a high level, we demonstrate that by following recommendations from the literature, researchers and practitioners who are not DL experts can achieve world-class performance using DL. More specifically, we report several findings. As a main result, applying DL on 39 big sparse behavioral classification tasks demonstrates a significant performance improvement compared with LR. A follow-up result suggests that if one were to choose the best shallow technique (rather than just LR), there still would often be an improvement from using DL, but that in this case the magnitude of the improvement might not justify the high cost. Investigating when DL performs better, we find that worse performance is obtained for data sets with low signal-from-noise separability-in line with prior results comparing linear and nonlinear classifiers. Exploring why the deep architectures work well, we show that using the first-layer features learned by DL yields better generalization performance for a linear model than do unsupervised feature-reduction methods (e.g., singular-value decomposition). However, to do well enough to beat well-regularized LR with the original sparse representation, more layers from the deep distributed architecture are needed. With respect to interpreting how deep models come to their decisions, we demonstrate how the neurons on the lowest layer of the deep architecture capture nuances from the raw fine-grained features and allow intuitive interpretation. Looking forward, we propose the use of instance-level counterfactual explanations to gain insight into why deep models classify individual data instances the way they do.","['1 Department of Engineering Management, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.', '2 Technology, Operations & Statistics Department, NYU Stern School of Business, New York, New York.']","Sofie De Cnudde, Yanou Ramon, David Martens, Foster Provost, ",Big data,2019 Dec,behavioral big data; classification; deep learning; logistic regression; sparse data.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31860341

      Triage is a process to accurately assess and classify symptoms to identify and provide rapid treatment to patients. The Korean Triage and Acuity Scale (KTAS) is used as a triage instrument in all emergency centers. The aim of this study was to train and compare machine learning models to predict KTAS levels. Methods:
      
    

    
      This was a cross-sectional study using data from a single emergency department of a tertiary university hospital. Information collected during triage was used in the analysis. Logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost were used to predict the KTAS level. Results:
      
    

    
      The models with the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) were the random forest and XGBoost models trained on the entire dataset (AUROC = 0.922, 95% confidence interval 0.917-0.925 and AUROC = 0.922, 95% confidence interval 0.918-0.925, respectively). The AUROC of the models trained on the clinical data was higher than that of models trained on text data only, but the models trained on all variables had the highest AUROC among similar machine learning models. Conclusions:

      The aim of this study was to develop an open-source natural language processing (NLP) pipeline for text mining of medical information from clinical reports. We also aimed to provide insight into why certain variables or reports are more suitable for clinical text mining than others. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      Various NLP models were developed to extract 15 radiologic characteristics from free-text radiology reports for patients with glioblastoma. Ten-fold cross-validation was used to optimize the hyperparameter settings and estimate model performance. We examined how model performance was associated with quantitative attributes of the radiologic characteristics and reports. Results:
      
    

    
      In total, 562 unique brain magnetic resonance imaging reports were retrieved. NLP extracted 15 radiologic characteristics with high to excellent discrimination (area under the curve, 0.82 to 0.98) and accuracy (78.6% to 96.6%). Model performance was correlated with the inter-rater agreement of the manually provided labels (ρ = 0.904; P < .001) but not with the frequency distribution of the variables of interest (ρ = 0.179; P = .52). All variables labeled with a near perfect inter-rater agreement were classified with excellent performance (area under the curve > 0.95). Excellent performance could be achieved for variables with only 50 to 100 observations in the minority group and class imbalances up to a 9:1 ratio. Report-level classification accuracy was not associated with the number of words or the vocabulary size in the distinct text documents. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      This study provides an open-source NLP pipeline that allows for text mining of narratively written clinical reports. Small sample sizes and class imbalance should not be considered as absolute contraindications for text mining in clinical research. However, future studies should report measures of inter-rater agreement whenever ground truth is based on a consensus label and use this measure to identify clinical variables eligible for text mining.","[""1 Computational Neuroscience Outcomes Center, Department of Neurosurgery, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", '2 Department of Neurosurgery, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands.', '3 Department of Neuroscience, Brown University, Providence, RI.', '4 Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY.', ""5 Department of Radiology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", '6 Department of Neurosurgery, Haaglanden Medical Center, The Hague, the Netherlands.']","Joeky T Senders, Logan D Cho, Paola Calvachi, John J McNulty, Joanna L Ashby, Isabelle S Schulte, Ahmad Kareem Almekkawi, Alireza Mehrtash, William B Gormley, Timothy R Smith, Marike L D Broekman, Omar Arnaout, ",JCO clinical cancer informatics,2020 Jan,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31977252

      Extracting concepts from biomedical texts is a key to support many advanced applications such as biomedical information retrieval. However, in clinical notes Named Entity Recognition (NER) has to deal with various types of errors such as spelling errors, grammatical errors, truncated sentences, and non-standard abbreviations. Moreover, in numerous countries, NER is challenged by the availability of many resources originally developed and only suitable for English texts. This paper presents the Cimind system, a multilingual system dedicated to named entity recognition in medical texts based on a phonetic similarity measure. Methods:
      
    

    
      Cimind performs entity recognition by combining phonetic recognition using the DM phonetic algorithm to deal with spelling errors and string similarity measures. Three main steps are processed to identify terms in a controlled vocabulary: normalization, candidate selection by phonetic similarity and candidate ranking. Results:

Yet, nearly all functional materials are still discovered by ""trial-and-error"", of which the lack of predictability affords a major materials bottleneck to technological innovation. The average ""molecule-to-market"" lead time for materials discovery is currently 20 years. This is far too long for industrial needs, as highlighted by the Materials Genome Initiative, which has ambitious targets of up to 4-fold reductions in average molecule-to-market lead times. Such a large step change in progress can only be realistically achieved if one adopts an entirely new approach to materials discovery. Fortunately, a fundamentally new approach to materials discovery has been emerging, whereby data science with artificial intelligence offers a prospective solution to speed up these average molecule-to-market lead times.This approach is known as data-driven materials discovery. Its broad prospects have only recently become a reality, given the timely and major advances in ""big data"", artificial intelligence, and high-performance computing (HPC). Access to massive data sets has been stimulated by government-regulated open-access requirements for data and literature. Natural-language processing (NLP) and machine-learning (ML) tools that can mine data and find patterns therein are becoming mainstream. Exascale HPC capabilities that can aid data mining and pattern recognition and also generate their own data from calculations are now within our grasp. These timely advances present an ideal opportunity to develop data-driven materials-discovery strategies to systematically design and predict new chemicals for a given device application.This Account shows how data science can afford materials discovery via a four-step ""design-to-device"" pipeline that entails (1) data extraction, (2) data enrichment, (3) material prediction, and (4) experimental validation. Massive databases of cognate chemical and property information are first forged from ""chemistry-aware"" natural-language-processing tools, such as ChemDataExtractor, and enriched using machine-learning methods and high-throughput quantum-chemical calculations. New materials for a bespoke application can then be predicted by mining these databases with algorithmic encodings of relationships between chemical structures and physical properties that are known to deliver functional materials. These may take the form of classification, enumeration, or machine-learning algorithms. A data-mining workflow short-lists these predictions to a handful of lead candidate materials that go forward to experimental validation. This design-to-device approach is being developed to offer a roadmap for the accelerated discovery of new chemicals for functional applications. Case studies presented demonstrate its utility for photovoltaic, optical, and catalytic applications. While this Account is focused on applications in the physical sciences, the generic pipeline discussed is readily transferable to other scientific disciplines such as biology and medicine.","['1 Cavendish Laboratory, Department of Physics, University of Cambridge, J.

314,An adverse drug effect mentions extraction method based on weighted online recurrent extreme learning machine,"Background and objective:
      
    

    
      Automatic extraction of adverse drug effect (ADE) mentions from biomedical texts is a challenging research problem that has attracted significant attention from the pharmacovigilance and biomedical text mining communities. Indeed, deep learning based methods have recently been employed to solve this issue with great success. However, they fail to effectively identify the boundary of mentions. In this paper, we propose a weighted online recurrent extreme learning machine (WOR-ELM) based method to overcome this drawback. Methods:
      
    

    
      The proposed method for ADE mentions extraction from biomedical texts is divided into two stages: span detection and ADE mentions classification. At the first stage, we identify the boundary of the mentions irrespective of their types with a WOR-ELM in a given sentence. At the second stage, another WOR-ELM is used to classify the identified mentions to the appropriate type. Both stages use the concatenation of character-level and word-level embeddings as features. The character-level embedding is obtained using a modified online recurrent extreme learning machine, whereas the word-level embedding is obtained from a pre-trained model. Results:
      
    

    
      Several experiments were carried out on a well-known ADE corpus to evaluate the effectiveness and demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method. The obtained results show that our method achieves an F-score of 87.5%, which outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our research results indicate that the proposed method for adverse drug effect mentions extraction from text can significantly improve performance over existing methods. Our experiments show the effectiveness of incorporating word-level and character level embeddings as features for WOR-ELM. They also illustrate the benefits of using IOU segment to represent ADE mentions.","['1 Laboratory of Informatics and Modeling, FSDM, Sidi Mohammed Ben Abdellah University, Fez, Morocco.

315,Application of electronic trigger tools to identify targets for improving diagnostic safety,"Progress in reducing diagnostic errors remains slow partly due to poorly defined methods to identify errors, high-risk situations, and adverse events. Electronic trigger (e-trigger) tools, which mine vast amounts of patient data to identify signals indicative of a likely error or adverse event, offer a promising method to efficiently identify errors. The increasing amounts of longitudinal electronic data and maturing data warehousing techniques and infrastructure offer an unprecedented opportunity to implement new types of e-trigger tools that use algorithms to identify risks and events related to the diagnostic process. We present a knowledge discovery framework, the Safer Dx Trigger Tools Framework, that enables health systems to develop and implement e-trigger tools to identify and measure diagnostic errors using comprehensive electronic health record (EHR) data. Safer Dx e-trigger tools detect potential diagnostic events, allowing health systems to monitor event rates, study contributory factors and identify targets for improving diagnostic safety. In addition to promoting organisational learning, some e-triggers can monitor data prospectively and help identify patients at high-risk for a future adverse event, enabling clinicians, patients or safety personnel to take preventive actions proactively. Successful application of electronic algorithms requires health systems to invest in clinical informaticists, information technology professionals, patient safety professionals and clinicians, all of who work closely together to overcome development and implementation challenges. We outline key future research, including advances in natural language processing and machine learning, needed to improve effectiveness of e-triggers. Integrating diagnostic safety e-triggers in institutional patient safety strategies can accelerate progress in reducing preventable harm from diagnostic errors.","['1 Center for Innovations in Quality, Effectiveness and Safety, Michael E DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Houston, Texas, USA drmurphy@bcm.edu.', '2 Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', '3 Center for Innovations in Quality, Effectiveness and Safety, Michael E DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', '4 School of Biomedical Informatics, University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', '5 Department of Medicine, University of Texas-Memorial Hermann Center for Healthcare Quality and Safety, Houston, Texas, USA.']","Daniel R Murphy, Ashley Nd Meyer, Dean F Sittig, Derek W Meeks, Eric J Thomas, Hardeep Singh, ",BMJ quality & safety,2019 Feb,diagnostic delays; diagnostic errors; electronic health records; health information technology; medical informatics; patient safety; triggers.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30291180
316,"Unravelling animal exposure profiles of human Q fever cases in Queensland, Australia, using natural language processing","Q fever, caused by the zoonotic bacterium Coxiella burnetii, is a globally distributed emerging infectious disease. Livestock are the most important zoonotic transmission sources, yet infection in people without livestock exposure is common. Identifying potential exposure pathways is necessary to design effective interventions and aid outbreak prevention. We used natural language processing and graphical network methods to provide insights into how Q fever notifications are associated with variation in patient occupations or lifestyles. Using an 18-year time-series of Q fever notifications in Queensland, Australia, we used topic models to test whether compositions of patient answers to follow-up exposure questionnaires varied between demographic groups or across geographical areas. To determine heterogeneity in possible zoonotic exposures, we explored patterns of livestock and game animal co-exposures using Markov Random Fields models. Finally, to identify possible correlates of Q fever case severity, we modelled patient probabilities of being hospitalized as a function of particular exposures. Different demographic groups consistently reported distinct sets of exposure terms and were concentrated in different areas of the state, suggesting the presence of multiple transmission pathways. Macropod exposure was commonly reported among Q fever cases, even when exposure to cattle, sheep or goats was absent. Males, older patients and those that reported macropod exposure were more likely to be hospitalized due to Q fever infection. Our study indicates that follow-up surveillance combined with text modelling is useful for unravelling exposure pathways in the battle to reduce Q fever incidence and associated morbidity.","['1 UQ Spatial Epidemiology Laboratory, School of Veterinary Science, The University of Queensland, Qld, Australia.', '2 Queensland Centre for Gynaecological Cancer, The University of Queensland, Qld, Australia.', '3 Melbourne Veterinary School, Faculty of Veterinary and Agricultural Sciences, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Vic., Australia.', '4 School of Animal and Veterinary Science, The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', '5 Graham Centre for Agricultural Innovation, School of Animal and Veterinary Sciences, Charles Sturt University, Wagga, NSW, Australia.', ""6 Children's Health and Environment Program, Child Health Research Centre, The University of Queensland, Qld, Australia.""]","Nicholas J Clark, Sarah Tozer, Caitlin Wood, Simon M Firestone, Mark Stevenson, Charles Caraguel, Anne-Lise Chaber, Jane Heller, Ricardo J Soares Magalhães, ",Transboundary and emerging diseases,2020,Coxiella burnetii; Australia; Markov Random Fields; Q fever; text mining; topic models; zoonosis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32259390

      There is an increasing amount of unstructured medical data that can be analysed for different purposes. However, information extraction from free text data may be particularly inefficient in the presence of spelling errors. Existing approaches use string similarity methods to search for valid words within a text, coupled with a supporting dictionary. However, they are not rich enough to encode both typing and phonetic misspellings. Results:
      
    

    
      Experimental results showed a joint string and language-dependent phonetic similarity is more accurate than traditional string distance metrics when identifying misspelt names of drugs in a set of medical records written in Portuguese. Conclusion:

318,Entity recognition in Chinese clinical text using attention-based CNN-LSTM-CRF,"Background:
      
    

    
      Clinical entity recognition as a fundamental task of clinical text processing has been attracted a great deal of attention during the last decade. However, most studies focus on clinical text in English rather than other languages. Recently, a few researchers have began to study entity recognition in Chinese clinical text. Methods:
      
    

    
      In this paper, a novel deep neural network, called attention-based CNN-LSTM-CRF, is proposed to recognize entities in Chinese clinical text. Attention-based CNN-LSTM-CRF is an extension of LSTM-CRF by introducing a CNN (convolutional neural network) layer after the input layer to capture local context information of words of interest and an attention layer before the CRF layer to select relevant words in the same sentence. Results:
      
    

    
      In order to evaluate the proposed method, we compare it with other two currently popular methods, CRF (conditional random field) and LSTM-CRF, on two benchmark datasets. One of the datasets is publically available and only contains contiguous clinical entities, and the other one is constructed by us and contains contiguous and discontiguous clinical entities. Experimental results show that attention-based CNN-LSTM-CRF outperforms CRF and LSTM-CRF. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      CNN and attention mechanism are individually beneficial to LSTM-CRF-based Chinese clinical entity recognition system, no matter whether contiguous clinical entities are considered. The conribution of attention mechanism is greater than CNN.","['1 Key Laboratory of Network Oriented Intelligent Computation, Harbin Institute of Technology, (Shenzhen), Shenzhen, 518055, China.', '2 Yidu Cloud (Beijing) Technology Co., Ltd, Beijing, 100191, China.', '3 Key Laboratory of Network Oriented Intelligent Computation, Harbin Institute of Technology, (Shenzhen), Shenzhen, 518055, China. qingcai.chen@gmail.com.']","Buzhou Tang, Xiaolong Wang, Jun Yan, Qingcai Chen, ",BMC medical informatics and decision making,2019,Chinese clinical entity recognition; Conditional random field; Convolutional neural network; Long-short term memory; Neural network.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30943972
319,Character-Level Neural Language Modelling in the Clinical Domain,"Word embeddings have become the predominant representation scheme on a token-level for various clinical natural language processing (NLP) tasks. More recently, character-level neural language models, exploiting recurrent neural networks, have again received attention, because they achieved similar performance against various NLP benchmarks. We investigated to what extent character-based language models can be applied to the clinical domain and whether they are able to capture reasonable lexical semantics using this maximally fine-grained representation scheme. We trained a long short-term memory network on an excerpt from a table of de-identified 50-character long problem list entries in German, each of which assigned to an ICD-10 code. We modelled the task as a time series of one-hot encoded single character inputs. After the training phase we accessed the top 10 most similar character-induced word embeddings related to a clinical concept via a nearest neighbour search and evaluated the expected interconnected semantics. Results showed that traceable semantics were captured on a syntactic level above single characters, addressing the idiosyncratic nature of clinical language. The results support recent work on general language modelling that raised the question whether token-based representation schemes are still necessary for specific NLP tasks.","['1 Institute for Medical Informatics, Statistics and Documentation, Medical University of Graz.', '2 CBmed GmbH - Center for Biomarker Research in Medicine.']","Markus Kreuzthaler, Michel Oleynik, Stefan Schulz, ",Studies in health technology and informatics,2020,Electronic Health Records; Natural Language Processing; Neural Networks.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32570351
320,Data for registry and quality review can be retrospectively collected using natural language processing from unstructured charts of arthroplasty patients,"Aims:
      
    

    
      Natural Language Processing (NLP) offers an automated method to extract data from unstructured free text fields for arthroplasty registry participation. Our objective was to investigate how accurately NLP can be used to extract structured clinical data from unstructured clinical notes when compared with manual data extraction. Methods:
      
    

    
      A group of 1,000 randomly selected clinical and hospital notes from eight different surgeons were collected for patients undergoing primary arthroplasty between 2012 and 2018. In all, 19 preoperative, 17 operative, and two postoperative variables of interest were manually extracted from these notes. A NLP algorithm was created to automatically extract these variables from a training sample of these notes, and the algorithm was tested on a random test sample of notes. Performance of the NLP algorithm was measured in Statistical Analysis System (SAS) by calculating the accuracy of the variables collected, the ability of the algorithm to collect the correct information when it was indeed in the note (sensitivity), and the ability of the algorithm to not collect a certain data element when it was not in the note (specificity). Results:
      
    

    
      The NLP algorithm performed well at extracting variables from unstructured data in our random test dataset (accuracy = 96.3%, sensitivity = 95.2%, and specificity = 97.4%). It performed better at extracting data that were in a structured, templated format such as range of movement (ROM) (accuracy = 98%) and implant brand (accuracy = 98%) than data that were entered with variation depending on the author of the note such as the presence of deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) (accuracy = 90%). Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The NLP algorithm used in this study was able to identify a subset of variables from randomly selected unstructured notes in arthroplasty with an accuracy above 90%. For some variables, such as objective exam data, the accuracy was very high. Our findings suggest that automated algorithms using NLP can help orthopaedic practices retrospectively collect information for registries and quality improvement (QI) efforts.

321,Differential ability of network and natural language information on social media to predict interpersonal and mental health traits,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Previous studies have shown that digital footprints (mainly Social Networking Services, or SNS) can predict personality traits centered on the Big Five. The present study investigates to what extent different types of SNS information predicts wider traits and attributes. Method:
      
    

    
      We collected an intensive set of 24 (52 subscales) personality traits and attributes (N = 239) and examined whether machine learning models trained on four different types of SNS (i.e., Twitter) information (network, time, word statistics, and bag of words) predict the traits and attributes. Results:
      
    

    
      We found that four types of SNS information can predict 23 subscales collectively. Furthermore, we validated our hypothesis that the network and word statistics information, respectively, exhibit unique strengths for the prediction of inter-personal traits such as autism and mental health traits such as schizophrenia and anxiety. We also found that intelligence is predicted by all four types of SNS information. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      These results reveal that the different types of SNS information can collectivity predict wider human traits and attributes than previously recognized, and also that each information type has unique predictive strengths for specific traits and attributes, suggesting that personality prediction from SNS is a powerful tool for both personality psychology and information technology.","['1 Center for Information and Neural Networks (CiNet), National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT), Suita, Japan.', '2 Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, Osaka University, Suita, Japan.', '3 Grauduate School of Frontier Biosciences, Osaka University, Suita, Japan.']","Kazuma Mori, Masahiko Haruno, ",Journal of personality,2020,SNS; component-wise gradient boosting; machine learning; natural language processing; network; personality traits; prediction; psychiatric disorders; time information.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32654146

      With the recent advances in computational science, machine-learning methods have been increasingly used in medical research. Because such projects usually require both a clinician and a computational data scientist, there is a need for interdisciplinary research collaboration. However, there has been no published analysis of research collaboration networks in cardiovascular medicine using machine intelligence. Methods:
      
    

    
      Co-authorship network analysis was conducted on 2857 research articles published between 2009 and 2019. Bibliographic data were collected from the Web of Science, and the co-authorship networks were represented as undirected multigraphs. The network density, average degree, clustering coefficient, and number of communities were calculated, and the chronological changes were assessed. Thereafter, the leading authors were identified according to the centrality metrics. Finally, we investigated the significance of the characteristics of the co-authorship network in the largest component via a Monte Carlo simulation with the Barabasi-Albert model. Results:
      
    

    
      The co-authorship network of the entire period consisted of 13,979 nodes and 68,668 weighted edges. A time-series analysis revealed a linear correlation between the number of nodes and the number of edges (R2 = 0.9937, p < 0.001). Additionally, the number of communities was linearly correlated with the number of nodes (R2 = 0.9788, p < 0.001). The average shortest path increased by a greater degree than the logarithm of the number of nodes, indicating the scale-free structure of the network. We identified D. Berman as the most central author with regard to the degree centrality and closeness centrality. S. Neubauer was the top-ranking author with regard to the betweenness centrality. Among the 22 authors who were ranked in the top 10 for any centrality, 14 authors (63.6%) had a medical degree (medical doctor, MD). The remaining eight non-MD researchers had a PhD in computational science-related fields. The number of communities detected in the Barabasi-Albert model simulation was similar to that for the largest component of the real network (6.21 ± 0.07 vs. 6, p = 0.096). Conclusions:

      When a paucity of clinical information is communicated from ordering physicians to radiologists at the time of radiology order entry, suboptimal imaging interpretations and patient care may result. Objectives:
      
    

    
      Compare documentation of relevant clinical information in electronic health record (EHR) provider note to computed tomography (CT) order requisition, prior to ordering of head CT for emergency department (ED) patients presenting with headache. Methods:
      
    

    
      In this institutional review board-approved retrospective observational study performed between April 1, 2013 and September 30, 2014 at an adult quaternary academic hospital, we reviewed data from 666 consecutive ED encounters for patients with headaches who received head CT. The primary outcome was the number of concept unique identifiers (CUIs) relating to headache extracted via ontology-based natural language processing from the history of present illness (HPI) section in ED notes compared with the number of concepts obtained from the imaging order requisition. Results:
      
    

    
      Our analysis was conducted on cases where the HPI note section was completed prior to image order entry, which occurred in 23.1% (154/666) of encounters. For these 154 encounters, the number of CUIs specific to headache per note extracted from the HPI (median = 3, interquartile range [IQR]: 2-4) was significantly greater than the number of CUIs per encounter obtained from the imaging order requisition (median = 1, IQR: 1-2; Wilcoxon signed rank p < 0.0001). Extracted concepts from notes were distinct from order requisition indications in 92.9% (143/154) of cases. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      EHR provider notes are a valuable source of relevant clinical information at the time of imaging test ordering. Automated extraction of clinical information from notes to prepopulate imaging order requisitions may improve communication between ordering physicians and radiologists, enhance efficiency of ordering process by reducing redundant data entry, and may help improve clinical relevance of clinical decision support at the time of order entry, potentially reducing provider burnout from extraneous alerts.","[""1 Center for Evidence-Based Imaging, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States."", ""2 Department of Radiology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States."", '3 Department of Population Health, Dell Medical School, Austin, Texas, United States.', '4 Department of Neurology, Dell Medical School, Austin, Texas, United States.', ""5 Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States."", '6 Department of Biomedical Informatics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.', ""7 Department of Emergency Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.""]","Justin F Rousseau, Ivan K Ip, Ali S Raja, Vladimir I Valtchinov, Laila Cochon, Jeremiah D Schuur, Ramin Khorasani, ",Applied clinical informatics,2019 Mar,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30895573

The aim of this study was to develop a medication-rights detection system using natural language processing and deep neural networks to automate medication-incident identification using free-text incident reports. We assessed the performance of deep neural network models in classifying the Advanced Incident Reporting System reports and compared the models' performance with that of other common classification methods (including logistic regression, support vector machines and the decision-tree method). We also evaluated the effects on prediction outcomes of several deep neural network model settings, including number of layers, number of neurons and activation regularisation functions. The accuracy of the models was measured at 0.9 or above across model settings and algorithms. The average values obtained for accuracy and area under the curve were 0.940 (standard deviation: 0.011) and 0.911 (standard deviation: 0.019), respectively. It is shown that deep neural network models were more accurate than the other classifiers across all of the tested class labels (including wrong patient, wrong drug, wrong time, wrong dose and wrong route). The deep neural network method outperformed other binary classifiers and our default base case model, and parameter arguments setting generally performed well for the five medication-rights datasets. The medication-rights detection system developed in this study successfully uses a natural language processing and deep-learning approach to classify patient-safety incidents using the Advanced Incident Reporting System reports, which may be transferable to other mandatory and voluntary incident reporting systems worldwide.","[""1 St. Luke's International University, Japan."", '2 New Territories East Cluster (NTEC), Hong Kong.']","Zoie Shui-Yee Wong, H Y So, Belinda Sc Kwok, Mavis Ws Lai, David Tf Sun, ",Health informatics journal,2020 Sep,artificial intelligence; hospital incident reporting; medication errors; patient safety; text mining.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31820664

      Numbers and numerical concepts appear frequently in free text clinical notes from electronic health records. Knowledge of the frequent lexical variations of these numerical concepts, and their accurate identification, is important for many information extraction tasks. This paper describes an analysis of the variation in how numbers and numerical concepts are represented in clinical notes. Methods:
      
    

    
      We used an inverted index of approximately 100 million notes to obtain the frequency of various permutations of numbers and numerical concepts, including the use of Roman numerals, numbers spelled as English words, and invalid dates, among others. Overall, twelve types of lexical variants were analyzed. Results:
      
    

    
      We found substantial variation in how these concepts were represented in the notes, including multiple data quality issues.

328,Can natural language processing help differentiate inflammatory intestinal diseases in China? Models applying random forest and convolutional neural network approaches,"Background:
      
    

    
      Differentiating between ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's disease (CD) and intestinal tuberculosis (ITB) using endoscopy is challenging. We aimed to realize automatic differential diagnosis among these diseases through machine learning algorithms. Methods:
      
    

    
      A total of 6399 consecutive patients (5128 UC, 875 CD and 396 ITB) who had undergone colonoscopy examinations in the Peking Union Medical College Hospital from January 2008 to November 2018 were enrolled. The input was the description of the endoscopic image in the form of free text. Word segmentation and key word filtering were conducted as data preprocessing. Random forest (RF) and convolutional neural network (CNN) approaches were applied to different disease entities. Three two-class classifiers (UC and CD, UC and ITB, and CD and ITB) and a three-class classifier (UC, CD and ITB) were built. Results:
      
    

    
      The classifiers built in this research performed well, and the CNN had better performance in general. The RF sensitivities/specificities of UC-CD, UC-ITB, and CD-ITB were 0.89/0.84, 0.83/0.82, and 0.72/0.77, respectively, while the values for the CNN of CD-ITB were 0.90/0.77. The precisions/recalls of UC-CD-ITB when employing RF were 0.97/0.97, 0.65/0.53, and 0.68/0.76, respectively, and when employing the CNN were 0.99/0.97, 0.87/0.83, and 0.52/0.81, respectively. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Classifiers built by RF and CNN approaches had excellent performance when classifying UC with CD or ITB. For the differentiation of CD and ITB, high specificity and sensitivity were achieved as well. Artificial intelligence through machine learning is very promising in helping unexperienced endoscopists differentiate inflammatory intestinal diseases. Conference:

329,Social media forensics applied to assessment of post-critical incident social reaction: The case of the 2017 Manchester Arena terrorist attack,"Forensic science is constantly evolving and transforming, reflecting the numerous technological innovations of recent decades. There are, however, continuing issues with the use of digital data, such as the difficulty of handling large-scale collections of text data. As one way of dealing with this problem, we used machine-learning techniques, particularly natural language processing and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling, to create an unsupervised text reduction method that was then used to study social reactions in the aftermath of the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing. Our database was a set of millions of messages posted on Twitter in the first 24 h after the attack. The findings show that our method improves on the tools presently used by law enforcement and other agencies to monitor social media, particularly following an event that is likely to create widespread social reaction. For example, it makes it possible to track different types of social reactions over time and to identify subevents that have a significant impact on public perceptions.","['1 Department of Chemistry, Biochemistry and Physics, Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières, Trois-Rivières, Canada.

330,Variation in Serious Illness Communication among Surgical Patients Receiving Palliative Care,"Background: Natural language processing (NLP), a form of computer-assisted data abstraction, rapidly identifies serious illness communication domains such as code-status confirmation and goals of care (GOC) discussions within free-text notes, using a codebook of phrases. Differences in the phrases associated with palliative care for patients with different types of illness are unknown. Objective: To compare communication of code-status clarification and GOC discussions between patients with advanced pancreatic cancer undergoing palliative procedures and patients admitted with life-threatening trauma. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting/Subjects: Patients with in-hospital admissions within two academic medical centers. Measurements: Sensitivity and specificity of NLP-identified communication domains compared with manual review. Results: Among patients with advanced pancreatic cancer (n = 523), NLP identified code-status clarification in 54% of admissions and GOC discussions in 49% of admissions. The sensitivity and specificity for code-status clarification were 94% and 99% respectively, while the sensitivity and specificity for a GOC discussion were 93% and 100%, respectively. Using the same codebook in patients with life-threatening trauma (n = 2093), NLP identified code-status clarification in 25.9% of admissions and GOC discussions in 6.3% of admissions. While NLP identification had 100% specificity, the sensitivity for code-status clarification and GOC discussion was reduced to 86% and 50%, respectively. Adding dynamic phrases such as ""ongoing discussions"" and phrases related to ""family meetings"" increased the sensitivity of the NLP codebook for code status to 98% and for GOC discussions to 100%. Conclusions: Communication of code status and GOC differ between patients with advanced cancer and those with life-threatening trauma.

      With the rapid spread of electronic medical records and the arrival of medical big data era, the application of natural language processing technology in biomedicine has become a hot research topic. Methods:
      
    

    
      In this paper, firstly, BiLSTM-CRF model is applied to medical named entity recognition on Chinese electronic medical record. According to the characteristics of Chinese electronic medical records, obtain the low-dimensional word vector of each word in units of sentences. And then input the word vector to BiLSTM to realize automatic extraction of sentence features. And then CRF performs sentence-level word tagging. Secondly, attention mechanism is added between the BiLSTM and the CRF to construct Attention-BiLSTM-CRF model, which can leverage document-level information to alleviate tagging inconsistency. In addition, this paper proposes an entity auto-correct algorithm to rectify entities according to historical entity information. At last, a drug dictionary and post-processing rules are well-built to rectify entities, to further improve performance. Results:

333,Contextual label sensitive gated network for biomedical event trigger extraction,"Biomedical events play a key role in improving biomedical research. Event trigger identification, extracting the words describing the event types, is a crucial and prerequisite step in the pipeline process of biomedical event extraction. There exist two main problems in previous methods: (1) The association among contextual trigger labels which can provide significant clues is ignored. (2)The weight between word embeddings and contextual features needs to be adjusted dynamically according to the trigger candidate. In this paper, we propose a novel contextual label sensitive gated network for biomedical event trigger extraction to solve the above two problems, which can mix the two parts dynamically and capture the contextual label clues automatically. Furthermore, we also introduce the dependency-based word embeddings to represent dependency-based semantic information as well as attention mechanism to get more focused representations. Experimental results show that our approach advances state-of-the-arts and achieves the best F1-score on the commonly used Multi-Level Event Extraction (MLEE) corpus.","['1 School of Computer Science and Technology, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China.

      International nursing research comparisons can give a new perspective on a nation's output by identifying strengths and weaknesses. Aim:
      
    

    
      This article compares strengths in nursing research between six mainly English-speaking nations (Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, United Kingdom and United States). Methods:
      
    

    
      Journal authorship (percentage of first authorship by nationality) and article keywords were compared for Scopus-indexed journal articles 2008-2018. Three natural language processing strategies were assessed for identifying statistically significant international differences in the use of keywords or phrases. Results:
      
    

    
      Journal author nationality was not a good indicator of international differences in research specialisms, but keyword and phrase differences were more promising especially if both are used. For this, the part of speech tagging and lemmatisation text processing strategies were helpful but not named entity recognition. The results highlight aspects of nursing research that were absent in some countries, such as papers about nursing administration and management. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Researchers outside the United States should consider the importance of researching specific patient groups, diseases, treatments, skills, research methods and social perspectives for unresearched gaps with national relevance.

337,A Comprehensive Review of Computational Methods for Automatic Prediction of Schizophrenia With Insight Into Indigenous Populations,"Psychiatrists rely on language and speech behavior as one of the main clues in psychiatric diagnosis. Descriptive psychopathology and phenomenology form the basis of a common language used by psychiatrists to describe abnormal mental states. This conventional technique of clinical observation informed early studies on disturbances of thought form, speech, and language observed in psychosis and schizophrenia. These findings resulted in language models that were used as tools in psychosis research that concerned itself with the links between formal thought disorder and language disturbances observed in schizophrenia. The end result was the development of clinical rating scales measuring severity of disturbances in speech, language, and thought form. However, these linguistic measures do not fully capture the richness of human discourse and are time-consuming and subjective when measured against psychometric rating scales. These linguistic measures have not considered the influence of culture on psychopathology. With recent advances in computational sciences, we have seen a re-emergence of novel research using computing methods to analyze free speech for improving prediction and diagnosis of psychosis. Current studies on automated speech analysis examining for semantic incoherence are carried out based on natural language processing and acoustic analysis, which, in some studies, have been combined with machine learning approaches for classification and prediction purposes.","['1 School of Computing, Unitec Institute of Technology, Auckland, New Zealand.', '2 Bay of Plenty District Health Board, Whakatane, New Zealand.']","Randall Ratana, Hamid Sharifzadeh, Jamuna Krishnan, Shaoning Pang, ",Frontiers in psychiatry,2019,computational methods; culture; language dysfunction; psychosis; schizophrenia.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31607962

      The clinical record text at the South London and Maudsley National Health Service Trust in the UK was used. Participants:

      Recorded poor insight within 1 month of registration was investigated in relation to (1) incidence of psychiatric hospitalisation, (2) odds of legally enforced hospitalisation, (3) number of days spent as a mental health inpatient and (4) number of different antipsychotic agents prescribed; outcomes were measured over varying follow-up periods from 12 months to 60 months, adjusting for a range of sociodemographic and clinical covariates. Results:
      
    

    
      Recorded poor insight, present in 48.9% of the sample, was positively associated with youngest and oldest age groups, unemployment and schizophrenia (compared with bipolar disorder) and was negatively associated with Asian ethnicity, married status, home ownership and recorded cannabis use. It was significantly associated with higher levels of all four outcomes over the succeeding 12 months. Associations with hospitalisation incidence and number of antipsychotics remained independently significant when measured over 60 and 48 months, respectively. Conclusions:

339,A Method of Constructing Marine Oil Spill Scenarios from Flat Text Based on Semantic Analysis,"Constructed emergency response scenarios provide a basis for decision makers to make management decisions, and the development of such scenarios considers earlier historical cases. Over the decades, the development of emergency response scenarios has mainly implemented the elements of historic cases to describe the grade and influence of an accident. This paper focuses on scenario construction and proposes a corresponding framework based on natural language processing (NLP) using text reports of marine oil spill accidents. For each accident, the original textual reports are first divided into sentence sets corresponding to the temporal evolution. Each sentence set is regarded as a textual description of a marine oil spill scenario. A method is proposed in this paper, based on parsing, named entity recognition (NER) and open information extraction (OpenIE) to process the relation triples that are extracted from the sentence sets. Finally, the relation triples are semantically clustered into different marine oil spill domains to construct scenarios. The research results are validated and indicate that the proposed scenario construction framework can be effectively used in practical applications.","['1 School of Geodesy and Geomatics, Wuhan University, Wuhan 420100, China.', '2 State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University, Wuhan 420100, China.']","Kui Huang, Wen Nie, Nianxue Luo, ",International journal of environmental research and public health,2020,marine oil spill; natural language processing; scenario construction; semantic clustering.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32295010
340,Natural Language Processing to Extract Meaningful Information from Patient Experience Feedback,"Background:
      
    

    
      Due to reimbursement tied in part to patients' perception of their care, hospitals continue to stress obtaining patient feedback and understanding it to plan interventions to improve patients' experience. We demonstrate the use of natural language processing (NLP) to extract meaningful information from patient feedback obtained through Press Ganey surveys. Methods:
      
    

    
      The first step was to standardize textual data programmatically using NLP libraries. This included correcting spelling mistakes, converting text to lowercase, and removing words that most likely did not carry useful information. Next, we converted numeric data pertaining to each category based on sentiment and care aspect into charts. We selected care aspect categories where there were more negative comments for more in-depth study. Using NLP, we made tables of most frequently appearing words, adjectives, and bigrams. Comments with frequent words/combinations underwent further study manually to understand factors contributing to negative patient feedback. We then used the positive and negative comments as the training dataset for a neural network to perform sentiment analysis on sentences obtained by splitting mixed reviews. Results:
      
    

    
      We found that most of the comments were about doctors and nurses, confirming the important role patients ascribed to these two in patient care. ""Room,"" ""discharge"" and ""tests and treatments"" were the three categories that had more negative than positive comments. We then tabulated commonly appearing words, adjectives, and two-word combinations. We found that climate control, housekeeping and noise levels in the room, time delays in discharge paperwork, conflicting information about discharge plan, frequent blood draws, and needle sticks were major contributors to negative patient feedback. None of this information was available from numeric data alone. Conclusion:

342,Automated Detection of Measurements and Their Descriptors in Radiology Reports Using a Hybrid Natural Language Processing Algorithm,"Radiological measurements are reported in free text reports, and it is challenging to extract such measures for treatment planning such as lesion summarization and cancer response assessment. The purpose of this work is to develop and evaluate a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline that can extract measurements and their core descriptors, such as temporality, anatomical entity, imaging observation, RadLex descriptors, series number, image number, and segment from a wide variety of radiology reports (MR, CT, and mammogram). We created a hybrid NLP pipeline that integrates rule-based feature extraction modules and conditional random field (CRF) model for extraction of the measurements from the radiology reports and links them with clinically relevant features such as anatomical entities or imaging observations. The pipeline was trained on 1117 CT/MR reports, and performance of the system was evaluated on an independent set of 100 expert-annotated CT/MR reports and also tested on 25 mammography reports. The system detected 813 out of 806 measurements in the CT/MR reports; 784 were true positives, 29 were false positives, and 0 were false negatives. Similarly, from the mammography reports, 96% of the measurements with their modifiers were extracted correctly. Our approach could enable the development of computerized applications that can utilize summarized lesion measurements from radiology report of varying modalities and improve practice by tracking the same lesions along multiple radiologic encounters.","['1 Department of Biomedical Data Science, Stanford University School of Medicine, Medical School Office Building (MSOB), Room X-335, MC 5464, 1265 Welch Road, Stanford, CA, 94305-5479, USA.', '2 Department of Radiology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA.', '3 Department of Biomedical Data Science, Stanford University School of Medicine, Medical School Office Building (MSOB), Room X-335, MC 5464, 1265 Welch Road, Stanford, CA, 94305-5479, USA. dlrubin@stanford.edu.', '4 Department of Radiology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA. dlrubin@stanford.edu.']","Selen Bozkurt, Emel Alkim, Imon Banerjee, Daniel L Rubin, ",Journal of digital imaging,2019 Aug,Conditional random fields; Measurement extraction; Natural language processing; Radiology report.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31222557

      Heart failure (HF) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. However, much of the clinical data is unstructured in the form of radiology reports, while the process of data collection and curation is arduous and time-consuming. Purpose:
      
    

    
      We utilized a machine learning (ML)-based natural language processing (NLP) approach to extract clinical terms from unstructured radiology reports. Additionally, we investigate the prognostic value of the extracted data in predicting all-cause mortality (ACM) in HF patients. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      This observational cohort study utilized 122,025 thoracoabdominal computed tomography (CT) reports from 11,808 HF patients obtained between 2008 and 2018. 1,560 CT reports were manually annotated for the presence or absence of 14 radiographic findings, in addition to age and gender. Thereafter, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was trained, validated and tested to determine the presence or absence of these features. Further, the ability of CNN to predict ACM was evaluated using Cox regression analysis on the extracted features. Results:

      Triaging of outpatient referrals to ophthalmology services is required for the maintenance of patient care and appropriate resource allocation. Machine learning (ML), in particular natural language processing, may be able to assist with the triaging process. Background:
      
    

    
      To determine whether ML can accurately predict triage category based on ophthalmology outpatient referrals. Design:
      
    

    
      Retrospective cohort study. Participants:
      
    

    
      The data of 208 participants was included in the project. Methods:
      
    

    
      The synopses of consecutive ophthalmology outpatient referrals at a tertiary hospital were extracted along with their triage categorizations. Following pre-processing, ML models were applied to determine how accurately they could predict the likely triage categorization allocated. Data was split into training and testing sets (75%/25% split). ML models were tested on an unseen test set, after development on the training dataset. Main outcome measure:

345,Basis and perspectives of artificial intelligence in radiation therapy,"Artificial intelligence is a highly polysemic term. In computer science, with the objective of being able to solve totally new problems in new contexts, artificial intelligence includes connectionism (neural networks) for learning and logics for reasoning. Artificial intelligence algorithms mimic tasks normally requiring human intelligence, like deduction, induction, and abduction. All apply to radiation oncology. Combined with radiomics, neural networks have obtained good results in image classification, natural language processing, phenotyping based on electronic health records, and adaptive radiation therapy. General adversial networks have been tested to generate synthetic data. Logics based systems have been developed for providing formal domain ontologies, supporting clinical decision and checking consistency of the systems. Artificial intelligence must integrate both deep learning and logic approaches to perform complex tasks and go beyond the so-called narrow artificial intelligence that is tailored to perform some highly specialized task. Combined together with mechanistic models, artificial intelligence has the potential to provide new tools such as digital twins for precision oncology.","[""1 Équipe sciences de l'information pour la médecine personnalisée, centre de recherche des Cordeliers, université Paris Descartes, université de Paris, 15, rue de l'École-de-Médecine, 75006 Paris, France; Service d'informatique médicale, hôpital européen Georges-Pompidou, AP-HP, 15, rue Leblanc, 75015 Paris, France.

      Delay to resective epilepsy surgery results in avoidable disease burden and increased risk of mortality. The objective was to prospectively validate a natural language processing (NLP) application that uses provider notes to assign epilepsy surgery candidacy scores. Methods:
      
    

    
      The application was trained on notes from (1) patients with a diagnosis of epilepsy and a history of resective epilepsy surgery and (2) patients who were seizure-free without surgery. The testing set included all patients with unknown surgical candidacy status and an upcoming neurology visit. Training and testing sets were updated weekly for 1 year. One- to three-word phrases contained in patients' notes were used as features. Patients prospectively identified by the application as candidates for surgery were manually reviewed by two epileptologists. Performance metrics were defined by comparing NLP-derived surgical candidacy scores with surgical candidacy status from expert chart review. Results:
      
    

    
      The training set was updated weekly and included notes from a mean of 519 ± 67 patients. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) from 10-fold cross-validation was 0.90 ± 0.04 (range = 0.83-0.96) and improved by 0.002 per week (P < .001) as new patients were added to the training set. Of the 6395 patients who visited the neurology clinic, 4211 (67%) were evaluated by the model. The prospective AUC on this test set was 0.79 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.62-0.96). Using the optimal surgical candidacy score threshold, sensitivity was 0.80 (95% CI = 0.29-0.99), specificity was 0.77 (95% CI = 0.64-0.88), positive predictive value was 0.25 (95% CI = 0.07-0.52), and negative predictive value was 0.98 (95% CI = 0.87-1.00).

347,Detecting Hypoglycemia Incidents Reported in Patients' Secure Messages: Using Cost-Sensitive Learning and Oversampling to Reduce Data Imbalance,"Background:
      
    

    
      Improper dosing of medications such as insulin can cause hypoglycemic episodes, which may lead to severe morbidity or even death. Although secure messaging was designed for exchanging nonurgent messages, patients sometimes report hypoglycemia events through secure messaging. Detecting these patient-reported adverse events may help alert clinical teams and enable early corrective actions to improve patient safety. Objective:
      
    

    
      We aimed to develop a natural language processing system, called HypoDetect (Hypoglycemia Detector), to automatically identify hypoglycemia incidents reported in patients' secure messages. Methods:
      
    

    
      An expert in public health annotated 3000 secure message threads between patients with diabetes and US Department of Veterans Affairs clinical teams as containing patient-reported hypoglycemia incidents or not. A physician independently annotated 100 threads randomly selected from this dataset to determine interannotator agreement. We used this dataset to develop and evaluate HypoDetect. HypoDetect incorporates 3 machine learning algorithms widely used for text classification: linear support vector machines, random forest, and logistic regression. We explored different learning features, including new knowledge-driven features. Because only 114 (3.80%) messages were annotated as positive, we investigated cost-sensitive learning and oversampling methods to mitigate the challenge of imbalanced data. Results:
      
    

    
      The interannotator agreement was Cohen kappa=.976. Using cross-validation, logistic regression with cost-sensitive learning achieved the best performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve=0.954, sensitivity=0.693, specificity 0.974, F1 score=0.590). Cost-sensitive learning and the ensembled synthetic minority oversampling technique improved the sensitivity of the baseline systems substantially (by 0.123 to 0.728 absolute gains). Our results show that a variety of features contributed to the best performance of HypoDetect. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Despite the challenge of data imbalance, HypoDetect achieved promising results for the task of detecting hypoglycemia incidents from secure messages. The system has a great potential to facilitate early detection and treatment of hypoglycemia.","['1 Department of Population and Quantitative Health Sciences, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, United States.', '2 Bedford Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Center for Healthcare Organization and Implementation Research, Bedford, MA, United States.', '3 College of Information and Computer Sciences, University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, MA, United States.', '4 Department of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts Lowell, Lowell, MA, United States.', '5 School of Medicine, Boston University, Boston, MA, United States.', '6 Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, United States.']","Jinying Chen, John Lalor, Weisong Liu, Emily Druhl, Edgard Granillo, Varsha G Vimalananda, Hong Yu, ",Journal of medical Internet research,2019,adverse event detection; drug-related side effects and adverse reactions; hypoglycemia; imbalanced data; natural language processing; secure messaging; supervised machine learning.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30855231
348,Automated classification of primary care patient safety incident report content and severity using supervised machine learning (ML) approaches,"Learning from patient safety incident reports is a vital part of improving healthcare. However, the volume of reports and their largely free-text nature poses a major analytic challenge. The objective of this study was to test the capability of autonomous classifying of free text within patient safety incident reports to determine incident type and the severity of harm outcome. Primary care patient safety incident reports (n=31333) previously expert-categorised by clinicians (training data) were processed using J48, SVM and Naïve Bayes. The SVM classifier was the highest scoring classifier for incident type (AUROC, 0.891) and severity of harm (AUROC, 0.708). Incident reports containing deaths were most easily classified, correctly identifying 72.82% of reports. In conclusion, supervised ML can be used to classify patient safety incident report categories. The severity classifier, whilst not accurate enough to replace manual processing, could provide a valuable screening tool for this critical aspect of patient safety.","['1 Cardiff University, UK.', '2 Swansea University, UK.', '3 Macquarie University, Australia; University of South Australia, Australia.', '4 Macquarie University, Australia.', '5 The University of Edinburgh, UK.', '6 London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, UK.', '7 Cardiff University, UK; Macquarie University, Australia.']","Huw Prosser Evans, Athanasios Anastasiou, Adrian Edwards, Peter Hibbert, Meredith Makeham, Saturnino Luz, Aziz Sheikh, Liam Donaldson, Andrew Carson-Stevens, ",Health informatics journal,2019,incident reporting; machine learning; natural language processing; patient safety; quality improvement.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30843455
349,Potential Technologies Review: A hybrid information retrieval framework to accelerate demand-pull innovation in biomedical engineering,"Launching biomedical innovations based on clinical demands instead of translating basic research findings to practice reduces the risk that the results will not fit the clinical routine. To realize this type of innovation, a meta-analysis of the body of research is necessary to reveal demand-matching concepts. However, both the data deluge and the narrow time constraints for innovation make it impossible to perform such reviews manually. Thus, this paper proposes a specifically adapted “Potential Technologies Review” approach focusing on automated text mining and information retrieval techniques. The novel framework combines features from both systematic and scoping reviews. It aims at high coverage and reproducibility while mapping technologies-even with a fuzzy initial scope. To achieve these goals for search and triage, a set of closely interrelated methods has been developed: (a) automated query optimization, (b) screening prioritization, and (c) recall estimation. To determine appropriate parameters, a variety of published literature corpora were used and compared with an evaluation on a real-world dataset. Our results show that it is feasible to automate the identification of relevant works using this newly introduced framework. It achieved a workload reduction of up to 91% “Work-saved-over Sampling (WSS)” with a 76% overall recall compared with manually screening search results. Reducing the workload is a prerequisite for a rapid Potential Technologies Review when conducting demand-pull innovations. Moreover, it facilitates the updating and closer monitoring of latest findings. Studying the robustness of the framework and expanding it to patent documents are future tasks.","['1 Science Management, Institute of Applied Medical Engineering, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', '2 Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', '3 Institute of Applied Medical Engineering, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.']","Tom Schmitz, Mark Bukowski, Steffen Koschmieder, Thomas Schmitz-Rode, Robert Farkas, ",Research synthesis methods,2019 Sep,WSS score; cross-validation; information retrieval; text mining; vector space model.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30995361
350,Beyond sound level monitoring: Exploitation of social media to gather citizens subjective response to noise,"Subjective response to noise is probably the most important goal in environmental acoustics. Traditional surveys have the drawback of high cost deriving from its development and execution, the limited number of participants, and the duration of the surveying campaign. The main drawbacks of online surveys are the low participation, or the self-produced bias that concerns about the topic can raise. In both cases, the process of designing questionnaires, implementing the survey, and analysing the results can be long, expensive and ineffective to monitor changes in the short-term. With the creation of Online Social Networks (OSN), people have changed the manner they communicate and use technology. Nowadays, people can provide information regarding their likes, opinion and discomfort about any topic, including noise, in just a few minutes with their smartphone. These Internet opinions can be analysed automatically using machine learning and Natural Language Processing techniques to get insights that can help in the early detection of noise problems, or in the prior assessment of action plans. This information can be significant helpful in addressing noise management by local authorities and stakeholders. The purpose of this paper is to present a novel methodology, based on machine learning, allowing for the gathering and processing of OSN text data, enabling the generation of a system able to exploit the data to detect noise complaints and to classify them by source. This methodology has been piloted in a case study using Twitter, and the main results are presented.","['1 Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Grupo I2A2, ETS Topografía, Campus Sur UPM, Ctra.

351,Word Embedding for the French Natural Language in Health Care: Comparative Study,"Background:
      
    

    
      Word embedding technologies, a set of language modeling and feature learning techniques in natural language processing (NLP), are now used in a wide range of applications. However, no formal evaluation and comparison have been made on the ability of each of the 3 current most famous unsupervised implementations (Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText) to keep track of the semantic similarities existing between words, when trained on the same dataset. Objective:
      
    

    
      The aim of this study was to compare embedding methods trained on a corpus of French health-related documents produced in a professional context. The best method will then help us develop a new semantic annotator. Methods:
      
    

    
      Unsupervised embedding models have been trained on 641,279 documents originating from the Rouen University Hospital. These data are not structured and cover a wide range of documents produced in a clinical setting (discharge summary, procedure reports, and prescriptions). In total, 4 rated evaluation tasks were defined (cosine similarity, odd one, analogy-based operations, and human formal evaluation) and applied on each model, as well as embedding visualization. Results:
      
    

    
      Word2Vec had the highest score on 3 out of 4 rated tasks (analogy-based operations, odd one similarity, and human validation), particularly regarding the skip-gram architecture. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Although this implementation had the best rate for semantic properties conservation, each model has its own qualities and defects, such as the training time, which is very short for GloVe, or morphological similarity conservation observed with FastText.

352,Multi-Level Representation Learning for Chinese Medical Entity Recognition: Model Development and Validation,"Background:
      
    

    
      Medical entity recognition is a key technology that supports the development of smart medicine. Existing methods on English medical entity recognition have undergone great development, but their progress in the Chinese language has been slow. Because of limitations due to the complexity of the Chinese language and annotated corpora, these methods are based on simple neural networks, which cannot effectively extract the deep semantic representations of electronic medical records (EMRs) and be used on the scarce medical corpora. We thus developed a new Chinese EMR (CEMR) dataset with six types of entities and proposed a multi-level representation learning model based on Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) for Chinese medical entity recognition. Objective:
      
    

    
      This study aimed to improve the performance of the language model by having it learn multi-level representation and recognize Chinese medical entities. Methods:
      
    

    
      In this paper, the pretraining language representation model was investigated; utilizing information not only from the final layer but from intermediate layers was found to affect the performance of the Chinese medical entity recognition task. Therefore, we proposed a multi-level representation learning model for entity recognition in Chinese EMRs. Specifically, we first used the BERT language model to extract semantic representations. Then, the multi-head attention mechanism was leveraged to automatically extract deeper semantic information from each layer. Finally, semantic representations from multi-level representation extraction were utilized as the final semantic context embedding for each token and we used softmax to predict the entity tags. Results:
      
    

    
      The best F1 score reached by the experiment was 82.11% when using the CEMR dataset, and the F1 score when using the CCKS (China Conference on Knowledge Graph and Semantic Computing) 2018 benchmark dataset further increased to 83.18%. Various comparative experiments showed that our proposed method outperforms methods from previous work and performs as a new state-of-the-art method. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The multi-level representation learning model is proposed as a method to perform the Chinese EMRs entity recognition task. Experiments on two clinical datasets demonstrate the usefulness of using the multi-head attention mechanism to extract multi-level representation as part of the language model.","['1 College of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Northwest Normal, Lanzhou, China.']","Zhichang Zhang, Lin Zhu, Peilin Yu, ",JMIR medical informatics,2020,Chinese; electronic medical records; medical entity recognition; multi-head attention mechanism; multi-level representation learning; natural language processing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32364514

We analyzed the predictive, concurrent, convergent, and content validity of six sentiment methods in a sample of 793,725 multidisciplinary clinical notes among 41,283 hospitalizations associated with an intensive care unit stay. None of these approaches improved early prediction of in-hospital mortality using logistic regression models, but did improve both discrimination and calibration when using random forests. Additionally, positive sentiment measured by the CoreNLP (OR 0.04, 95% CI 0.002-0.55), Pattern (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.04-0.17), sentimentr (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.25-0.63), and Opinion (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.07-0.89) methods were inversely associated with death on the concurrent day after adjustment for demographic characteristics and illness severity. Median daily lexical coverage ranged from 5.4% to 20.1%. While sentiment between all methods was positively correlated, their agreement was weak. Sentiment analysis holds promise for clinical applications but will require a novel domain-specific method applicable to clinical text.","['1 Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Division, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA; Palliative and Advanced Illness Research (PAIR) Center, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA; Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.

355,Mobile Peer-Support for Opioid Use Disorders: Refinement of an Innovative Machine Learning Tool,"Background:
      
    

    
      The majority of individuals with Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) do not receive any formal substance use treatment. Due to limited engagement and access to traditional treatment, there is increasing evidence that patients with OUDs turn to online social platforms to access peer support and obtain health-related information about addiction and recovery. Interacting with peers before and during recovery is a key component of many evidence-based addiction recovery programs, and may improve self-efficacy and treatment engagement as well as reduce relapse. Commonly-used online social platforms are limited in utility and scalability as an adjunct to addiction treatment; lack effective content moderation (e.g., misinformed advice, maliciousness or ""trolling""); and lack common security and ethical safeguards inherent to clinical care. Methods:
      
    

    
      This present study will develop a novel, artificial-intelligence (AI) enabled, mobile treatment delivery method that fulfills the need for a robust, secure, technology-based peer support platform to support patients with OUD. Forty adults receiving outpatient buprenorphine treatment for OUD will be asked to pilot a smartphone-based mobile peer support application, the ""Marigold App"", for a duration of six weeks. The program will use (1) a prospective cohort study to obtain text message content and feasibility metrics, and (2) qualitative interviews to evaluate usability and acceptability of the mobile platform. Anticipated findings and future directions:
      
    

    
      The Marigold mobile platform will allow patients to access a tailored chat support group 24/7 as a complement to different forms of clinical OUD treatment. Marigold can keep groups safe and constructive by augmenting chats with AI tools capable of understanding the emotional sentiment in messages, automatically ""flagging"" critical or clinically relevant content. This project will demonstrate the robustness of these AI tools by adapting them to catch OUD-specific ""flags"" in peer messages while also examining the adoptability of the platform itself within OUD patients.","['1 Department of Emergency Medicine, Rhode Island Hospital, 593 Eddy Street, Providence, RI 02903, USA.', '2 Department of Psychiatry, Rhode Island Hospital, 593 Eddy Street, Providence, RI 02903, USA.', '3 Department of Emergency Medicine, Alpert Medical School of Brown University, 55 Claverick Street 2nd Floor, Providence, RI 02903, USA.', '4 Marigold Health, 2 Ave de Lafayette, Boston, MA 02111, USA.', '5 Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior, Alpert Medical School of Brown University, 700 Butler Drive, Providence, RI 02906, USA.', '6 Center for Behavioral and Preventive Medicine, The Miriam Hospital, Alpert Medical School of Brown University, 167 Point Street, Providence, RI 02903, USA.', '7 Department of Health Services, Policy, and Practice, Brown School of Public Health, 121 South Main Street, Providence, RI 02912, USA.']","Caroline R Scherzer, Megan L Ranney, Shrenik Jain, Satya Prateek Bommaraju, John Patena, Kirsten Langdon, Evelyn Nimaja, Ernestine Jennings, Francesca L Beaudoin, ",Journal of psychiatry and brain science,2020,application; machine-learning; mobile treatment; natural language processing; opioid use disorder; peer support; technology.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32149192
356,Do Neural Information Extraction Algorithms Generalize Across Institutions?,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      Natural language processing (NLP) techniques have been adopted to reduce the curation costs of electronic health records. However, studies have questioned whether such techniques can be applied to data from previously unseen institutions. We investigated the performance of a common neural NLP algorithm on data from both known and heldout (ie, institutions whose data were withheld from the training set and only used for testing) hospitals. We also explored how diversity in the training data affects the system's generalization ability. Methods:
      
    

    
      We collected 24,881 breast pathology reports from seven hospitals and manually annotated them with nine key attributes that describe types of atypia and cancer. We trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) on annotations from either only one (CNN1), only two (CNN2), or only four (CNN4) hospitals. The trained systems were tested on data from five organizations, including both known and heldout ones. For every setting, we provide the accuracy scores as well as the learning curves that show how much data are necessary to achieve good performance and generalizability. Results:
      
    

    
      The system achieved a cross-institutional accuracy of 93.87% when trained on reports from only one hospital (CNN1). Performance improved to 95.7% and 96%, respectively, when the system was trained on reports from two (CNN2) and four (CNN4) hospitals. The introduction of diversity during training did not lead to improvements on the known institutions, but it boosted performance on the heldout institutions. When tested on reports from heldout hospitals, CNN4 outperformed CNN1 and CNN2 by 2.13% and 0.3%, respectively. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Real-world scenarios require that neural NLP approaches scale to data from previously unseen institutions. We show that a common neural NLP algorithm for information extraction can achieve this goal, especially when diverse data are used during training.","['1 Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA.', '2 Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, MI.', '3 Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI.', '4 Liaquat National Hospital & Medical College, Karachi, Pakistan.', '5 Rochester General Hospital, Rochester, NY.', '6 Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA.']","Enrico Santus, Clara Li, Adam Yala, Donald Peck, Rufina Soomro, Naveen Faridi, Isra Mamshad, Rong Tang, Conor R Lanahan, Regina Barzilay, Kevin Hughes, ",JCO clinical cancer informatics,2019 Jul,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31310566
357,Chemical-induced disease relation extraction via attention-based distant supervision,"Background:
      
    

    
      Automatically understanding chemical-disease relations (CDRs) is crucial in various areas of biomedical research and health care. Supervised machine learning provides a feasible solution to automatically extract relations between biomedical entities from scientific literature, its success, however, heavily depends on large-scale biomedical corpora manually annotated with intensive labor and tremendous investment. Results:
      
    

    
      We present an attention-based distant supervision paradigm for the BioCreative-V CDR extraction task. Training examples at both intra- and inter-sentence levels are generated automatically from the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) without any human intervention. An attention-based neural network and a stacked auto-encoder network are applied respectively to induce learning models and extract relations at both levels. After merging the results of both levels, the document-level CDRs can be finally extracted. It achieves the precision/recall/F1-score of 60.3%/73.8%/66.4%, outperforming the state-of-the-art supervised learning systems without using any annotated corpus. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Our experiments demonstrate that distant supervision is promising for extracting chemical disease relations from biomedical literature, and capturing both local and global attention features simultaneously is effective in attention-based distantly supervised learning.","['1 Natural Language Processing Lab, School of Computer Science and Technology, Soochow University, 1 Shizi Street, Suzhou, China.', '2 Big Data Group, Baidu Inc., Beijing, China.', '3 Department of Gynecology Minimally Invasive Center, Beijing Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', '4 Natural Language Processing Lab, School of Computer Science and Technology, Soochow University, 1 Shizi Street, Suzhou, China. qianlonghua@suda.edu.cn.']","Jinghang Gu, Fuqing Sun, Longhua Qian, Guodong Zhou, ",BMC bioinformatics,2019,Attention; Biomedical relation extraction; Deep learning; Distant supervision.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31331263
358,Towards automated generation of curated datasets in radiology: Application of natural language processing to unstructured reports exemplified on CT for pulmonary embolism,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      To design and evaluate a self-trainable natural language processing (NLP)-based procedure to classify unstructured radiology reports. The method enabling the generation of curated datasets is exemplified on CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) reports. Method:
      
    

    
      We extracted the impressions of CTPA reports created at our institution from 2016 to 2018 (n = 4397; language: German). The status (pulmonary embolism: yes/no) was manually labelled for all exams. Data from 2016/2017 (n = 2801) served as a ground truth to train three NLP architectures that only require a subset of reference datasets for training to be operative. The three architectures were as follows: a convolutional neural network (CNN), a support vector machine (SVM) and a random forest (RF) classifier. Impressions of 2018 (n = 1377) were kept aside and used for general performance measurements. Furthermore, we investigated the dependence of classification performance on the amount of training data with multiple simulations. Results:
      
    

    
      The classification performance of all three models was excellent (accuracies: 97 %-99 %; F1 scores 0.88-0.97; AUCs: 0.993-0.997). Highest accuracy was reached by the CNN with 99.1 % (95 % CI 98.5-99.6 %). Training with 470 labelled impressions was sufficient to reach an accuracy of > 93 % with all three NLP architectures. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Our NLP-based approaches allow for an automated and highly accurate retrospective classification of CTPA reports with manageable effort solely using unstructured impression sections. We demonstrated that this approach is useful for the classification of radiology reports not written in English. Moreover, excellent classification performance is achieved at relatively small training set sizes.","['1 University Hospital Basel, Clinic of Radiology & Nuclear Medicine, University of Basel, Petersgraben 4, 4031 Basel, Switzerland.

359,Learning distributed representations of RNA and protein sequences and its application for predicting lncRNA-protein interactions,"The long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are ubiquitous in organisms and play crucial role in a variety of biological processes and complex diseases. Emerging evidences suggest that lncRNAs interact with corresponding proteins to perform their regulatory functions. Therefore, identifying interacting lncRNA-protein pairs is the first step in understanding the function and mechanism of lncRNA. Since it is time-consuming and expensive to determine lncRNA-protein interactions by high-throughput experiments, more robust and accurate computational methods need to be developed. In this study, we developed a new sequence distributed representation learning based method for potential lncRNA-Protein Interactions Prediction, named LPI-Pred, which is inspired by the similarity between natural language and biological sequences. More specifically, lncRNA and protein sequences were divided into k-mer segmentation, which can be regard as ""word"" in natural language processing. Then, we trained out the RNA2vec and Pro2vec model using word2vec and human genome-wide lncRNA and protein sequences to mine distribution representation of RNA and protein. Then, the dimension of complex features is reduced by using feature selection based on Gini information impurity measure. Finally, these discriminative features are used to train a Random Forest classifier to predict lncRNA-protein interactions. Five-fold cross-validation was adopted to evaluate the performance of LPI-Pred on three benchmark datasets, including RPI369, RPI488 and RPI2241. The results demonstrate that LPI-Pred can be a useful tool to provide reliable guidance for biological research.","['1 The Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi 830011, China.', '2 University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.']","Hai-Cheng Yi, Zhu-Hong You, Li Cheng, Xi Zhou, Tong-Hai Jiang, Xiao Li, Yan-Bin Wang, ",Computational and structural biotechnology journal,2019,Distribution representation; Natural language processing; RNA-protein interaction; Word2vec.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31890140
360,Should free-text data in electronic medical records be shared for research? A citizens' jury study in the UK,"Background:
      
    

    
      Use of routinely collected patient data for research and service planning is an explicit policy of the UK National Health Service and UK government. Much clinical information is recorded in free-text letters, reports and notes. These text data are generally lost to research, due to the increased privacy risk compared with structured data. We conducted a citizens' jury which asked members of the public whether their medical free-text data should be shared for research for public benefit, to inform an ethical policy. Methods:
      
    

    
      Eighteen citizens took part over 3 days. Jurors heard a range of expert presentations as well as arguments for and against sharing free text, and then questioned presenters and deliberated together. They answered a questionnaire on whether and how free text should be shared for research, gave reasons for and against sharing and suggestions for alleviating their concerns. Results:
      
    

    
      Jurors were in favour of sharing medical data and agreed this would benefit health research, but were more cautious about sharing free-text than structured data. They preferred processing of free text where a computer extracted information at scale. Their concerns were lack of transparency in uses of data, and privacy risks. They suggested keeping patients informed about uses of their data, and giving clear pathways to opt out of data sharing. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Informed citizens suggested a transparent culture of research for the public benefit, and continuous improvement of technology to protect patient privacy, to mitigate their concerns regarding privacy risks of using patient text data.","['1 Department of Primary Care and Public Health, Brighton and Sussex Medical School, Brighton, UK e.m.ford@bsms.ac.uk.', ""2 Citizens' Juries CIC, Manchester, UK."", '3 Division of Informatics, Imaging and Data Sciences, School of Health Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', '4 Jefferson Center, Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA.', '5 Department of Computer Science, The University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.', '6 Department of Primary Care and Public Health, Brighton and Sussex Medical School, Brighton, UK.']","Elizabeth Ford, Malcolm Oswald, Lamiece Hassan, Kyle Bozentko, Goran Nenadic, Jackie Cassell, ",Journal of medical ethics,2020 Jun,healthcare; medical text; natural language processing; privacy; stakeholder participation; text mining.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32457202
361,Predicting COVID-19 in China Using Hybrid AI Model,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) breaking out in late December 2019 is gradually being controlled in China, but it is still spreading rapidly in many other countries and regions worldwide. It is urgent to conduct prediction research on the development and spread of the epidemic. In this article, a hybrid artificial-intelligence (AI) model is proposed for COVID-19 prediction. First, as traditional epidemic models treat all individuals with coronavirus as having the same infection rate, an improved susceptible-infected (ISI) model is proposed to estimate the variety of the infection rates for analyzing the transmission laws and development trend. Second, considering the effects of prevention and control measures and the increase of the public's prevention awareness, the natural language processing (NLP) module and the long short-term memory (LSTM) network are embedded into the ISI model to build the hybrid AI model for COVID-19 prediction. The experimental results on the epidemic data of several typical provinces and cities in China show that individuals with coronavirus have a higher infection rate within the third to eighth days after they were infected, which is more in line with the actual transmission laws of the epidemic. Moreover, compared with the traditional epidemic models, the proposed hybrid AI model can significantly reduce the errors of the prediction results and obtain the mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) with 0.52%, 0.38%, 0.05%, and 0.86% for the next six days in Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai, and countrywide, respectively.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Nanning Zheng, Shaoyi Du, Jianji Wang, He Zhang, Wenting Cui, Zijian Kang, Tao Yang, Bin Lou, Yuting Chi, Hong Long, Mei Ma, Qi Yuan, Shupei Zhang, Dong Zhang, Feng Ye, Jingmin Xin, ",IEEE transactions on cybernetics,2020 Jul,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32396126
362,PID Controller-Based Stochastic Optimization Acceleration for Deep Neural Networks,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely used and demonstrated their power in many applications, such as computer vision and pattern recognition. However, the training of these networks can be time consuming. Such a problem could be alleviated by using efficient optimizers. As one of the most commonly used optimizers, stochastic gradient descent-momentum (SGD-M) uses past and present gradients for parameter updates. However, in the process of network training, SGD-M may encounter some drawbacks, such as the overshoot phenomenon. This problem would slow the training convergence. To alleviate this problem and accelerate the convergence of DNN optimization, we propose a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) approach. Specifically, we investigate the intrinsic relationships between the PID-based controller and SGD-M first. We further propose a PID-based optimization algorithm to update the network parameters, where the past, current, and change of gradients are exploited. Consequently, our proposed PID-based optimization alleviates the overshoot problem suffered by SGD-M. When tested on popular DNN architectures, it also obtains up to 50% acceleration with competitive accuracy. Extensive experiments about computer vision and natural language processing demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on benchmark data sets, including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Tiny-ImageNet, and PTB.

      To adapt and evaluate a deep learning language model for answering why-questions based on patient-specific clinical text. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      Bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) models were trained with varying data sources to perform SQuAD 2.0 style why-question answering (why-QA) on clinical notes. The evaluation focused on: (1) comparing the merits from different training data and (2) error analysis. Results:
      
    

    
      The best model achieved an accuracy of 0.707 (or 0.760 by partial match). Training toward customization for the clinical language helped increase 6% in accuracy. Discussion:
      
    

    
      The error analysis suggested that the model did not really perform deep reasoning and that clinical why-QA might warrant more sophisticated solutions. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The BERT model achieved moderate accuracy in clinical why-QA and should benefit from the rapidly evolving technology.

      To determine the degree to which dimensional psychopathology predicts length of stay in an emergency department (ED) and need for hospital admission among children with psychiatric complaints. Method:
      
    

    
      Electronic health records of children age 4-17 years who presented to the ED of a large academic medical center were analyzed using a natural language processing tool to estimate Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) symptom scores. These scores' association with length of stay and probability of admission versus discharge to home were evaluated. Results:
      
    

    
      We identified 3061 children and adolescents who presented to the ED and were evaluated by the psychiatry service between November 2008 and March 2015. Median length of stay was 7.8 h (interquartile range 5.2-14.3 h) and 1696 (55.4%) were admitted to the hospital. Higher estimated RDoC arousal, cognitive, positive, and social domain scores were associated with increased length of stay in multiple regression models, adjusted for age, sex, race, private insurance, voluntary admission, and diagnostic categories. In similarly adjusted models, odds of hospital admission were increased by higher RDoC arousal and cognitive domain scores and decreased by higher negative domain scores. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      A natural language processing tool to characterize dimensional psychopathology identified features associated with differential outcomes in children in the psychiatric ED, most notably symptoms reflecting arousal and cognitive function.

365,Deep learning in generating radiology reports: A survey,"Substantial progress has been made towards implementing automated radiology reporting models based on deep learning (DL). This is due to the introduction of large medical text/image datasets. Generating radiology coherent paragraphs that do more than traditional medical image annotation, or single sentence-based description, has been the subject of recent academic attention. This presents a more practical and challenging application and moves towards bridging visual medical features and radiologist text. So far, the most common approach has been to utilize publicly available datasets and develop DL models that integrate convolutional neural networks (CNN) for image analysis alongside recurrent neural networks (RNN) for natural language processing (NLP) and natural language generation (NLG). This is an area of research that we anticipate will grow in the near future. We focus our investigation on the following critical challenges: understanding radiology text/image structures and datasets, applying DL algorithms (mainly CNN and RNN), generating radiology text, and improving existing DL based models and evaluation metrics. Lastly, we include a critical discussion and future research recommendations.

Given the increase of interest in conversational agents integrated in mobile health applications, our objective in this work is to introduce a concept for analyzing emotions and sentiments expressed by a person in a mobile health application with a conversational user interface. The approach bases upon bot technology (Synthetic intelligence markup language) and deep learning for emotion analysis. More specifically, expressions referring to sentiments or emotions are classified along seven categories and three stages of strengths using treebank annotation and recursive neural networks. The classification result is used by the chatbot for selecting an appropriate response. In this way, the concerns of a user can be better addressed. We describe three use cases where the approach could be integrated to make the chatbot emotion-sensitive.","['1 Bern University of Applied Sciences, Institute for Medical Informatics, Bern, Switzerland.']","Kerstin Denecke, Richard May, Yihan Deng, ",Studies in health technology and informatics,2019,Conversational user interface; deep learning; natural language processing; sentiment analysis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31438108
368,Clinical Documentation to Predict Factors Associated with Urinary Incontinence Following Prostatectomy for Prostate Cancer,"Background:
      
    

    
      Advances in data collection provide opportunities to use population samples in identifying risk factors for urinary incontinence (UI), which occurs in up to 71% of men with prostate cancer following prostatectomy. Most studies on patient-centered outcomes use surveys or manual chart abstraction for data collection, which can be costly and difficult to scale. We sought to evaluate rates of and risk factors for UI following prostatectomy using natural language processing on electronic health record (EHR) data. Methods:
      
    

    
      We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients undergoing prostatectomy for prostate cancer between January 2008 and August 2018 using EHR data from an academic medical center. UI incidence for each patient in the cohort was assessed using natural language processing from clinical notes generated pre- and postoperatively. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate potential risk factors for postoperative UI at various time points within 2 years following surgery. Results:
      
    

    
      We identified 3792 patients who underwent prostatectomy for prostate cancer. We found a significant association between preoperative UI and UI in the first (odds ratio [OR], 2.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24-4.28) and second (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.04-4.83) years following surgery. Preoperative body mass index was also associated with UI in the second postoperative year (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.02-1.21). Conclusion:
      
    

    
      We show that a natural language processing approach using clinical narratives can be used to assess risk for UI in prostate cancer patients.

370,Early Detection of Adverse Drug Reactions in Social Health Networks: A Natural Language Processing Pipeline for Signal Detection,"Background:
      
    

    
      Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) occur in nearly all patients on chemotherapy, causing morbidity and therapy disruptions. Detection of such ADRs is limited in clinical trials, which are underpowered to detect rare events. Early recognition of ADRs in the postmarketing phase could substantially reduce morbidity and decrease societal costs. Internet community health forums provide a mechanism for individuals to discuss real-time health concerns and can enable computational detection of ADRs. Objective:
      
    

    
      The goal of this study is to identify cutaneous ADR signals in social health networks and compare the frequency and timing of these ADRs to clinical reports in the literature. Methods:
      
    

    
      We present a natural language processing-based, ADR signal-generation pipeline based on patient posts on Internet social health networks. We identified user posts from the Inspire health forums related to two chemotherapy classes: erlotinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor, and nivolumab and pembrolizumab, immune checkpoint inhibitors. We extracted mentions of ADRs from unstructured content of patient posts. We then performed population-level association analyses and time-to-detection analyses. Results:
      
    

    
      Our system detected cutaneous ADRs from patient reports with high precision (0.90) and at frequencies comparable to those documented in the literature but an average of 7 months ahead of their literature reporting. Known ADRs were associated with higher proportional reporting ratios compared to negative controls, demonstrating the robustness of our analyses. Our named entity recognition system achieved a 0.738 microaveraged F-measure in detecting ADR entities, not limited to cutaneous ADRs, in health forum posts. Additionally, we discovered the novel ADR of hypohidrosis reported by 23 patients in erlotinib-related posts; this ADR was absent from 15 years of literature on this medication and we recently reported the finding in a clinical oncology journal. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Several hundred million patients report health concerns in social health networks, yet this information is markedly underutilized for pharmacosurveillance. We demonstrated the ability of a natural language processing-based signal-generation pipeline to accurately detect patient reports of ADRs months in advance of literature reporting and the robustness of statistical analyses to validate system detections. Our findings suggest the important contributions that social health network data can play in contributing to more comprehensive and timely pharmacovigilance.","['1 Stanford Center for Biomedical Informatics Research, Stanford Department of Medicine, Stanford, CA, United States.', '2 Inspire, Arlington, VA, United States.', '3 Department of Dermatology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, United States.']","Azadeh Nikfarjam, Julia D Ransohoff, Alison Callahan, Erik Jones, Brian Loew, Bernice Y Kwong, Kavita Y Sarin, Nigam H Shah, ",JMIR public health and surveillance,2019,adverse drug reactions; antineoplastic agents; drug-related side effects; machine learning; medical oncology; natural language processing; signal detection; social media.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31162134
371,Assessing Prevalence of Hypoglycemia in a Medical Transcription Database,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      The prevalence of hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes mellitus is likely underreported, particularly with regard to non-severe episodes, and representative estimates require more detailed data than claims or typical electronic health record (EHR) databases provide. This study examines the prevalence of hypoglycemia as identified in a medical transcription database. Patients and methods:
      
    

    
      The Amplity Insights database contains medical content dictated by providers detailing patient encounters with health care professionals (HCPs) from across the United States. Natural language processing (NLP) was used to identify episodes of hypoglycemia using both symptom-based and non-symptom-based definitions of hypoglycemic events. This study examined records of 41,688 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and 317,399 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus between January 1, 2016, and April 30, 2018. Results:
      
    

    
      Using a non-symptom-based definition, the prevalence of hypoglycemia was 18% among patients with T1DM and 8% among patients with T2DM. These estimates show the prevalence of hypoglycemia to be 2- to 9-fold higher than the 1% to 4% prevalence estimates suggested by claims database analyses. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      In this exploration of a medical transcription database, the prevalence of hypoglycemia was considerably higher than what has been reported via retrospective analyses from claims and EHR databases.

Method: A training dataset of therapy transcripts for 1,864 patients was established by detecting patient content endorsing suicidality using a proxy-model anchored on therapists' suicide prevention interventions; human expert raters then assessed the level of suicide risk endorsed by patients identified by the proxy-model (i.e., no risk, risk factors, ideation, method, or plan). A bag-of-words classification model was then iteratively built using the annotations from the expert raters to detect suicide risk level in 85,216 labeled patients' sentences from the training dataset. Results: The final NLP model identified risk-related content from non-risk content with good accuracy (AUC = 82.78). Conclusions: Risk for suicide could be reliably identified by the NLP algorithm. The risk detection model could assist telehealth clinicians in providing crisis resources in a timely manner. This modeling approach could also be applied to other psychotherapy research tasks to assist in the understanding of how the psychotherapy process unfolds for each patient and therapist.","['1 Talkspace, New York, NY, USA.', '2 NYU Grossman School of Medicine, New York, USA.', '3 Columbia University, New York, USA.']","Niels Bantilan, Matteo Malgaroli, Bonnie Ray, Thomas D Hull, ",Psychotherapy research : journal of the Society for Psychotherapy Research,2020,digital health; machine learning; natural language processing; suicide; telemedicine.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32558625
373,VINCENT: A visual analytics system for investigating the online vaccine debate,"This paper reports and describes VINCENT, a visual analytics system that is designed to help public health stakeholders (i.e., users) make sense of data from websites involved in the online debate about vaccines. VINCENT allows users to explore visualizations of data from a group of 37 vaccine-focused websites. These websites differ in their position on vaccines, topics of focus about vaccines, geographic location, and sentiment towards the efficacy and morality of vaccines, specific and general ones. By integrating webometrics, natural language processing of website text, data visualization, and human-data interaction, VINCENT helps users explore complex data that would be difficult to understand, and, if at all possible, to analyze without the aid of computational tools. The objectives of this paper are to explore A) the feasibility of developing a visual analytics system that integrates webometrics, natural language processing of website text, data visualization, and human-data interaction in a seamless manner; B) how a visual analytics system can help with the investigation of the online vaccine debate; and C) what needs to be taken into consideration when developing such a system. This paper demonstrates that visual analytics systems can integrate different computational techniques; that such systems can help with the exploration of online public health debates that are distributed across a set of websites; and that care should go into the design of the different components of such systems.","['1 INSIGHT Lab, Western University, CANADA.']","Anton Ninkov, Kamran Sedig, ",Online journal of public health informatics,2019,Data Visualization; Human-Data Interaction; Natural Language Processing; Public Health; Vaccine Debate; Visual Analytics; Webometrics.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31632599
374,Customization scenarios for de-identification of clinical notes,"Background:
      
    

    
      Automated machine-learning systems are able to de-identify electronic medical records, including free-text clinical notes. Use of such systems would greatly boost the amount of data available to researchers, yet their deployment has been limited due to uncertainty about their performance when applied to new datasets. Objective:
      
    

    
      We present practical options for clinical note de-identification, assessing performance of machine learning systems ranging from off-the-shelf to fully customized. Methods:
      
    

    
      We implement a state-of-the-art machine learning de-identification system, training and testing on pairs of datasets that match the deployment scenarios. We use clinical notes from two i2b2 competition corpora, the Physionet Gold Standard corpus, and parts of the MIMIC-III dataset. Results:
      
    

    
      Fully customized systems remove 97-99% of personally identifying information. Performance of off-the-shelf systems varies by dataset, with performance mostly above 90%. Providing a small labeled dataset or large unlabeled dataset allows for fine-tuning that improves performance over off-the-shelf systems. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Health organizations should be aware of the levels of customization available when selecting a de-identification deployment solution, in order to choose the one that best matches their resources and target performance level.","['1 Google Research, Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA, USA.', '2 Google Research, Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA, USA. hoorys@google.com.', '3 , Palo Alto, CA, USA.']","Tzvika Hartman, Michael D Howell, Jeff Dean, Shlomo Hoory, Ronit Slyper, Itay Laish, Oren Gilon, Danny Vainstein, Greg Corrado, Katherine Chou, Ming Jack Po, Jutta Williams, Scott Ellis, Gavin Bee, Avinatan Hassidim, Rony Amira, Genady Beryozkin, Idan Szpektor, Yossi Matias, ",BMC medical informatics and decision making,2020,Clinical notes; De-identification; Electronic health records; Free text; Natural language processing; Recurrent neural networks.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32000770

      Track 1 of the 2018 National NLP Clinical Challenges shared tasks focused on identifying which patients in a corpus of longitudinal medical records meet and do not meet identified selection criteria. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      To address this challenge, we annotated American English clinical narratives for 288 patients according to whether they met these criteria. We chose criteria from existing clinical trials that represented a variety of natural language processing tasks, including concept extraction, temporal reasoning, and inference. Results:
      
    

    
      A total of 47 teams participated in this shared task, with 224 participants in total. The participants represented 18 countries, and the teams submitted 109 total system outputs. The best-performing system achieved a micro F1 score of 0.91 using a rule-based approach. The top 10 teams used rule-based and hybrid systems to approach the problems. Discussion:
      
    

    
      Clinical narratives are open to interpretation, particularly in cases where the selection criterion may be underspecified. This leaves room for annotators to use domain knowledge and intuition in selecting patients, which may lead to error in system outputs. However, teams who consulted medical professionals while building their systems were more likely to have high recall for patients, which is preferable for patient selection systems. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      There is not yet a 1-size-fits-all solution for natural language processing systems approaching this task.

376,Generating Medical Assessments Using a Neural Network Model: Algorithm Development and Validation,"Background:
      
    

    
      Since its inception, artificial intelligence has aimed to use computers to help make clinical diagnoses. Evidence-based medical reasoning is important for patient care. Inferring clinical diagnoses is a crucial step during the patient encounter. Previous works mainly used expert systems or machine learning-based methods to predict the International Classification of Diseases - Clinical Modification codes based on electronic health records. We report an alternative approach: inference of clinical diagnoses from patients' reported symptoms and physicians' clinical observations. Objective:
      
    

    
      We aimed to report a natural language processing system for generating medical assessments based on patient information described in the electronic health record (EHR) notes. Methods:
      
    

    
      We processed EHR notes into the Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan sections. We trained a neural network model for medical assessment generation (N2MAG). Our N2MAG is an innovative deep neural model that uses the Subjective and Objective sections of an EHR note to automatically generate an ""expert-like"" assessment of the patient. N2MAG can be trained in an end-to-end fashion and does not require feature engineering and external knowledge resources. Results:
      
    

    
      We evaluated N2MAG and the baseline models both quantitatively and qualitatively. Evaluated by both the Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation metrics and domain experts, our results show that N2MAG outperformed the existing state-of-the-art baseline models. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      N2MAG could generate a medical assessment from the Subject and Objective section descriptions in EHR notes.

377,Text-mined fossil biodiversity dynamics using machine learning,"Documented occurrences of fossil taxa are the empirical foundation for understanding large-scale biodiversity changes and evolutionary dynamics in deep time. The fossil record contains vast amounts of understudied taxa. Yet the compilation of huge volumes of data remains a labour-intensive impediment to a more complete understanding of Earth's biodiversity history. Even so, many occurrence records of species and genera in these taxa can be uncovered in the palaeontological literature. Here, we extract observations of fossils and their inferred ages from unstructured text in books and scientific articles using machine-learning approaches. We use Bryozoa, a group of marine invertebrates with a rich fossil record, as a case study. Building on recent advances in computational linguistics, we develop a pipeline to recognize taxonomic names and geologic time intervals in published literature and use supervised learning to machine-read whether the species in question occurred in a given age interval. Intermediate machine error rates appear comparable to human error rates in a simple trial, and resulting genus richness curves capture the main features of published fossil diversity studies of bryozoans. We believe our automated pipeline, that greatly reduced the time required to compile our dataset, can help others compile similar data for other taxa.","['1 1 Natural History Museum, University of Oslo , PO Box 1172, Blindern, 0318 Oslo , Norway.', '2 2 Integrative Research Center, Field Museum , 1400 South Lake Shore Drive, Chicago IL, 60605 , USA.', '3 3 Centre for Ecological and Evolutionary Synthesis, Department of Biosciences, University of Oslo , PO Box 1066, Blindern, 0316 Oslo , Norway.']","Bjørn Tore Kopperud, Scott Lidgard, Lee Hsiang Liow, ",Proceedings.

378,Automatic detection of eating disorder-related social media posts that could benefit from a mental health intervention,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Online forums allow people to semi-anonymously discuss their struggles, often leading to greater honesty. This characteristic makes forums valuable for identifying users in need of immediate help from mental health professionals. Because it would be impractical to manually review every post on a forum to identify users in need of urgent help, there may be value to developing algorithms for automatically detecting posts reflecting a heightened risk of imminent plans to engage in disordered behaviors. Method:
      
    

    
      Five natural language processing techniques (tools to perform computational text analysis) were used on a data set of 4,812 posts obtained from six eating disorder-related subreddits. Two licensed clinical psychologists labeled 53 of these posts, deciding whether or not the content of the post indicated that its author needed immediate professional help. The remaining 4,759 posts were unlabeled. Results:
      
    

    
      Each of the five techniques ranked the 50 posts most likely to be intervention-worthy (the ""top-50""). The two most accurate detection techniques had an error rate of 4% for their respective top-50. Discussion:

379,Biomedical named entity recognition and linking datasets: survey and our recent development,"Natural language processing (NLP) is widely applied in biological domains to retrieve information from publications. Systems to address numerous applications exist, such as biomedical named entity recognition (BNER), named entity normalization (NEN) and protein-protein interaction extraction (PPIE). High-quality datasets can assist the development of robust and reliable systems; however, due to the endless applications and evolving techniques, the annotations of benchmark datasets may become outdated and inappropriate. In this study, we first review commonlyused BNER datasets and their potential annotation problems such as inconsistency and low portability. Then, we introduce a revised version of the JNLPBA dataset that solves potential problems in the original and use state-of-the-art named entity recognition systems to evaluate its portability to different kinds of biomedical literature, including protein-protein interaction and biology events. Lastly, we introduce an ensembled biomedical entity dataset (EBED) by extending the revised JNLPBA dataset with PubMed Central full-text paragraphs, figure captions and patent abstracts. This EBED is a multi-task dataset that covers annotations including gene, disease and chemical entities. In total, it contains 85000 entity mentions, 25000 entity mentions with database identifiers and 5000 attribute tags.

380,Using Natural Language Processing to improve EHR Structured Data-based Surgical Site Infection Surveillance,"Surgical Site Infection surveillance in healthcare systems is labor intensive and plagued by underreporting as current methodology relies heavily on manual chart review. The rapid adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has the potential to allow the secondary use of EHR data for quality surveillance programs. This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of integrating natural language processing (NLP) outputs with structured EHR data to build machine learning models for SSI identification using real-world clinical data. We examined a set of models using structured data with and without NLP document-level, mention-level, and keyword features. The top-performing model was based on a Random Forest classifier enhanced with NLP document-level features achieving a 0.58 sensitivity, 0.97 specificity, 0.54 PPV, 0.98 NPV, and 0.52 F0.5 score.

381,Ensembles of natural language processing systems for portable phenotyping solutions,"Background:
      
    

    
      Manually curating standardized phenotypic concepts such as Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms from narrative text in electronic health records (EHRs) is time consuming and error prone. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques can facilitate automated phenotype extraction and thus improve the efficiency of curating clinical phenotypes from clinical texts. While individual NLP systems can perform well for a single cohort, an ensemble-based method might shed light on increasing the portability of NLP pipelines across different cohorts. Methods:
      
    

    
      We compared four NLP systems, MetaMapLite, MedLEE, ClinPhen and cTAKES, and four ensemble techniques, including intersection, union, majority-voting and machine learning, for extracting generic phenotypic concepts. We addressed two important research questions regarding automated phenotype recognition. First, we evaluated the performance of different approaches in identifying generic phenotypic concepts. Second, we compared the performance of different methods to identify patient-specific phenotypic concepts. To better quantify the effects caused by concept granularity differences on performance, we developed a novel evaluation metric that considered concept hierarchies and frequencies. Each of the approaches was evaluated on a gold standard set of clinical documents annotated by clinical experts. One dataset containing 1,609 concepts derived from 50 clinical notes from two different institutions was used in both evaluations, and an additional dataset of 608 concepts derived from 50 case report abstracts obtained from PubMed was used for evaluation of identifying generic phenotypic concepts only. Results:
      
    

    
      For generic phenotypic concept recognition, the top three performers in the NYP/CUIMC dataset are union ensemble (F1, 0.634), training-based ensemble (F1, 0.632), and majority vote-based ensemble (F1, 0.622). In the Mayo dataset, the top three are majority vote-based ensemble (F1, 0.642), cTAKES (F1, 0.615), and MedLEE (F1, 0.559). In the PubMed dataset, the top three are majority vote-based ensemble (F1, 0.719), training-based (F1, 0.696) and MetaMapLite (F1, 0.694). For identifying patient specific phenotypes, the top three performers in the NYP/CUIMC dataset are majority vote-based ensemble (F1, 0.610), MedLEE (F1, 0.609), and training-based ensemble (F1, 0.585). In the Mayo dataset, the top three are majority vote-based ensemble (F1, 0.604), cTAKES (F1, 0.531) and MedLEE (F1, 0.527). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our study demonstrates that ensembles of natural language processing can improve both generic phenotypic concept recognition and patient specific phenotypic concept identification over individual systems. Among the individual NLP systems, each individual system performed best when they were applied in the dataset that they were primary designed for. However, combining multiple NLP systems to create an ensemble can generally improve the performance. Specifically, the ensemble can increase the results reproducibility across different cohorts and tasks, and thus provide a more portable phenotyping solution compared to individual NLP systems.","['1 Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.', '2 Division of Biomedical Statistics and Informatics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55901, USA.', '3 Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.

382,Detection of medical text semantic similarity based on convolutional neural network,"Background:
      
    

    
      Imaging examinations, such as ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scans, play key roles in healthcare settings. To assess and improve the quality of imaging diagnosis, we need to manually find and compare the pre-existing reports of imaging and pathology examinations which contain overlapping exam body sites from electrical medical records (EMRs). The process of retrieving those reports is time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) based method which can better utilize semantic information contained in report texts to accelerate the retrieving process. Methods:
      
    

    
      We included 16,354 imaging and pathology report-pairs from 1926 patients who admitted to Shanghai Tongren Hospital and had ultrasonic examinations between 1st May 2017 and 31st July 2017. We adapted the CNN model to calculate the similarities among the report-pairs to identify target report-pairs with overlapping body sites, and compared the performance with other six conventional models, including keyword mapping, latent semantic analysis (LSA), latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), Doc2Vec, Siamese long short term memory (LSTM) and a model based on named entity recognition (NER). We also utilized graph embedding method to enhance the word representation by capturing the semantic relations information from medical ontologies. Additionally, we used LIME algorithm to identify which features (or words) are decisive for the prediction results and improved the model interpretability. Results:
      
    

    
      Experiment results showed that our CNN model gained significant improvement compared to all other conventional models on area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC), precision, recall and F1-score in our test dataset. The AUROC of our CNN models gained approximately 3-7% improvement. The AUROC of CNN model with graph-embedding and ontology based medical concept vectors was 0.8% higher than the model with randomly initialized vectors and 1.5% higher than the one with pre-trained word vectors. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Our study demonstrates that CNN model with pre-trained medical concept vectors could accurately identify target report-pairs with overlapping body sites and potentially accelerate the retrieving process for imaging diagnosis quality measurement.","['1 Institute of Image Communication and Networking, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', '2 Tongren Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', '3 Synyi Research, Shanghai, China.', '4 Department of Healthcare Policy and Research, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, USA.', '5 APEX Data and Knowledge Management Lab, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', '6 Synyi Research, Shanghai, China. 018033210003@sjtu.edu.cn.', '7 Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China. 018033210003@sjtu.edu.cn.']","Tao Zheng, Yimei Gao, Fei Wang, Chenhao Fan, Xingzhi Fu, Mei Li, Ya Zhang, Shaodian Zhang, Handong Ma, ",BMC medical informatics and decision making,2019,Convolutional neural network; LIME; Natural language processing; Text similarity.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31391038
383,BO-LSTM: classifying relations via long short-term memory networks along biomedical ontologies,"Background:
      
    

    
      Recent studies have proposed deep learning techniques, namely recurrent neural networks, to improve biomedical text mining tasks. However, these techniques rarely take advantage of existing domain-specific resources, such as ontologies. In Life and Health Sciences there is a vast and valuable set of such resources publicly available, which are continuously being updated. Biomedical ontologies are nowadays a mainstream approach to formalize existing knowledge about entities, such as genes, chemicals, phenotypes, and disorders. These resources contain supplementary information that may not be yet encoded in training data, particularly in domains with limited labeled data. Results:
      
    

    
      We propose a new model to detect and classify relations in text, BO-LSTM, that takes advantage of domain-specific ontologies, by representing each entity as the sequence of its ancestors in the ontology. We implemented BO-LSTM as a recurrent neural network with long short-term memory units and using open biomedical ontologies, specifically Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI), Human Phenotype, and Gene Ontology. We assessed the performance of BO-LSTM with drug-drug interactions mentioned in a publicly available corpus from an international challenge, composed of 792 drug descriptions and 233 scientific abstracts. By using the domain-specific ontology in addition to word embeddings and WordNet, BO-LSTM improved the F1-score of both the detection and classification of drug-drug interactions, particularly in a document set with a limited number of annotations. We adapted an existing DDI extraction model with our ontology-based method, obtaining a higher F1 score than the original model. Furthermore, we developed and made available a corpus of 228 abstracts annotated with relations between genes and phenotypes, and demonstrated how BO-LSTM can be applied to other types of relations. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our findings demonstrate that besides the high performance of current deep learning techniques, domain-specific ontologies can still be useful to mitigate the lack of labeled data.","['1 LASIGE, Faculdade de Ciências, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisboa, 1749 016, Portugal. alamurias@lasige.di.fc.ul.pt.', '2 University of Lisboa, Faculty of Sciences, BioISI - Biosystems & Integrative Sciences Institute, Campo Grande, C8 bdg, Lisboa, 1749 016, Portugal. alamurias@lasige.di.fc.ul.pt.', '3 LASIGE, Faculdade de Ciências, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisboa, 1749 016, Portugal.', '4 University of Lisboa, Faculty of Sciences, BioISI - Biosystems & Integrative Sciences Institute, Campo Grande, C8 bdg, Lisboa, 1749 016, Portugal.']","Andre Lamurias, Diana Sousa, Luka A Clarke, Francisco M Couto, ",BMC bioinformatics,2019,Deep learning; Drug-drug interactions; Long short term memory; Relation extraction; Text mining.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30616557

      The overwhelming size and rapid growth of the biomedical literature make it impossible for scientists to read all studies related to their work, potentially leading to missed connections and wasted time and resources. Literature-based discovery (LBD) aims to alleviate these issues by identifying implicit links between disjoint parts of the literature. While LBD has been studied in depth since its introduction three decades ago, there has been limited work making use of recent advances in biomedical text processing methods in LBD. Results:
      
    

    
      We present LION LBD, a literature-based discovery system that enables researchers to navigate published information and supports hypothesis generation and testing. The system is built with a particular focus on the molecular biology of cancer using state-of-the-art machine learning and natural language processing methods, including named entity recognition and grounding to domain ontologies covering a wide range of entity types and a novel approach to detecting references to the hallmarks of cancer in text. LION LBD implements a broad selection of co-occurrence based metrics for analyzing the strength of entity associations, and its design allows real-time search to discover indirect associations between entities in a database of tens of millions of publications while preserving the ability of users to explore each mention in its original context in the literature. Evaluations of the system demonstrate its ability to identify undiscovered links and rank relevant concepts highly among potential connections. Availability and implementation:

385,Major-Minor Long Short-Term Memory for Word-Level Language Model,"Language model (LM) plays an important role in natural language processing (NLP) systems, such as machine translation, speech recognition, learning token embeddings, natural language generation, and text classification. Recently, the multilayer long short-term memory (LSTM) models have been demonstrated to achieve promising performance on word-level language modeling. For each LSTM layer, larger hidden size usually means more diverse semantic features, which enables the LM to perform better. However, we have observed that when a certain LSTM layer reaches a sufficiently large scale, the promotion of overall effect will slow down, as its hidden size increases. In this article, we analyze that an important factor leading to this phenomenon is the high correlation between the newly extended hidden states and the original hidden states, which hinders diverse feature expression of the LSTM. As a result, when the scale is large enough, simply lengthening the LSTM hidden states will cost tremendous extra parameters but has little effect. We propose a simple yet effective improvement on each LSTM layer consisting of a large-scale Major LSTM and a small-scale Minor LSTM to break the high correlation between the two parts of hidden states, which we call Major-Minor LSTMs (MMLSTMs). In experiments, we demonstrate the LM with MMLSTMs surpasses the existing state-of-the-art model on Penn Treebank (PTB) and WikiText-2 (WT2) data sets and outperforms the baseline by 3.3 points in perplexity on WikiText-103 data set without increasing model parameter counts.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Kai Shuang, Rui Li, Mengyu Gu, Jonathan Loo, Sen Su, ",IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31825875
386,OGER++: hybrid multi-type entity recognition,"Background:
      
    

    
      We present a text-mining tool for recognizing biomedical entities in scientific literature. OGER++ is a hybrid system for named entity recognition and concept recognition (linking), which combines a dictionary-based annotator with a corpus-based disambiguation component. The annotator uses an efficient look-up strategy combined with a normalization method for matching spelling variants. The disambiguation classifier is implemented as a feed-forward neural network which acts as a postfilter to the previous step. Results:
      
    

    
      We evaluated the system in terms of processing speed and annotation quality. In the speed benchmarks, the OGER++ web service processes 9.7 abstracts or 0.9 full-text documents per second. On the CRAFT corpus, we achieved 71.4% and 56.7% F1 for named entity recognition and concept recognition, respectively. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Combining knowledge-based and data-driven components allows creating a system with competitive performance in biomedical text mining.","['1 Institute of Computational Linguistics, University of Zurich, Andreasstr. 15, 8050, Zürich, Switzerland.', '2 Institute of Computational Linguistics, University of Zurich, Andreasstr. 15, 8050, Zürich, Switzerland. fabio.rinaldi@uzh.ch.', '3 Fondazione Bruno Kessler, Via Sommarive, 18, 38123, Trento, Italy. fabio.rinaldi@uzh.ch.']","Lenz Furrer, Anna Jancso, Nicola Colic, Fabio Rinaldi, ",Journal of cheminformatics,2019,Concept recognition; Machine learning; Named entity recognition; Natural language processing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30666476
387,Neural machine translation of clinical texts between long distance languages,"Objective:
      
    

    
      To analyze techniques for machine translation of electronic health records (EHRs) between long distance languages, using Basque and Spanish as a reference. We studied distinct configurations of neural machine translation systems and used different methods to overcome the lack of a bilingual corpus of clinical texts or health records in Basque and Spanish. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      We trained recurrent neural networks on an out-of-domain corpus with different hyperparameter values. Subsequently, we used the optimal configuration to evaluate machine translation of EHR templates between Basque and Spanish, using manual translations of the Basque templates into Spanish as a standard. We successively added to the training corpus clinical resources, including a Spanish-Basque dictionary derived from resources built for the machine translation of the Spanish edition of SNOMED CT into Basque, artificial sentences in Spanish and Basque derived from frequently occurring relationships in SNOMED CT, and Spanish monolingual EHRs. Apart from calculating bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) values, we tested the performance in the clinical domain by human evaluation. Results:
      
    

    
      We achieved slight improvements from our reference system by tuning some hyperparameters using an out-of-domain bilingual corpus, obtaining 10.67 BLEU points for Basque-to-Spanish clinical domain translation. The inclusion of clinical terminology in Spanish and Basque and the application of the back-translation technique on monolingual EHRs significantly improved the performance, obtaining 21.59 BLEU points. This was confirmed by the human evaluation performed by 2 clinicians, ranking our machine translations close to the human translations. Discussion:
      
    

    
      We showed that, even after optimizing the hyperparameters out-of-domain, the inclusion of available resources from the clinical domain and applied methods were beneficial for the described objective, managing to obtain adequate translations of EHR templates. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      We have developed a system which is able to properly translate health record templates from Basque to Spanish without making use of any bilingual corpus of clinical texts or health records.","['1 Faculty of Informatics, Computer Languages and Systems, Ixa Research Group, University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Donostia, Spain.']","Xabier Soto, Olatz Perez-de-Viñaspre, Gorka Labaka, Maite Oronoz, ",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2019,electronic health records; long distance languages; machine translation; natural language processing; neural networks.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31334764
388,Artificial intelligence-based conversational agent to support medication prescribing,"Objective:
      
    

    
      This article describes the system architecture, training, initial use, and performance of Watson Assistant (WA), an artificial intelligence-based conversational agent, accessible within Micromedex®. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      The number and frequency of intents (target of a user's query) triggered in WA during its initial use were examined; intents triggered over 9 months were compared to the frequency of topics accessed via keyword search of Micromedex. Accuracy of WA intents assigned to 400 queries was compared to assignments by 2 independent subject matter experts (SMEs), with inter-rater reliability measured by Cohen's kappa. Results:
      
    

    
      In over 126 000 conversations with WA, intents most frequently triggered involved dosing (N = 30 239, 23.9%) and administration (N = 14 520, 11.5%). SMEs with substantial inter-rater agreement (kappa = 0.71) agreed with intent mapping in 247 of 400 queries (62%), including 16 queries related to content that WA and SMEs agreed was unavailable in WA. SMEs found 57 (14%) of 400 queries incorrectly mapped by WA; 112 (28%) queries unanswerable by WA included queries that were either ambiguous, contained unrecognized typographical errors, or addressed topics unavailable to WA. Of the queries answerable by WA (288), SMEs determined 231 (80%) were correctly linked to an intent. Discussion:
      
    

    
      A conversational agent successfully linked most queries to intents in Micromedex. Ongoing system training seeks to widen the scope of WA and improve matching capabilities. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      WA enabled Micromedex users to obtain answers to many medication-related questions using natural language, with the conversational agent facilitating mapping to a broader distribution of topics than standard keyword searches.","['1 IBM Watson Health, Cambridge, MA, USA.', '2 Department of Surgery, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.', '3 Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.', '4 Department of Pediatrics, Nashville, TN, USA.']","Anita M Preininger, Brett South, Jeff Heiland, Adam Buchold, Mya Baca, Suwei Wang, Rex Nipper, Nawshin Kutub, Bryan Bohanan, Gretchen Purcell Jackson, ",JAMIA open,2020,artificial intelligence; conversational agents; machine learning; natural language processing; pharmacological information systems.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32734163
389,Intelligent diagnosis with Chinese electronic medical records based on convolutional neural networks,"Background:
      
    

    
      Benefiting from big data, powerful computation and new algorithmic techniques, we have been witnessing the renaissance of deep learning, particularly the combination of natural language processing (NLP) and deep neural networks. The advent of electronic medical records (EMRs) has not only changed the format of medical records but also helped users to obtain information faster. However, there are many challenges regarding researching directly using Chinese EMRs, such as low quality, huge quantity, imbalance, semi-structure and non-structure, particularly the high density of the Chinese language compared with English. Therefore, effective word segmentation, word representation and model architecture are the core technologies in the literature on Chinese EMRs. Results:
      
    

    
      In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework to study intelligent diagnosis using Chinese EMR data, which incorporates a convolutional neural network (CNN) into an EMR classification application. The novelty of this paper is reflected in the following: (1) We construct a pediatric medical dictionary based on Chinese EMRs. (2) Word2vec adopted in word embedding is used to achieve the semantic description of the content of Chinese EMRs. (3) A fine-tuning CNN model is constructed to feed the pediatric diagnosis with Chinese EMR data. Our results on real-world pediatric Chinese EMRs demonstrate that the average accuracy and F1-score of the CNN models are up to 81%, which indicates the effectiveness of the CNN model for the classification of EMRs. Particularly, a fine-tuning one-layer CNN performs best among all CNNs, recurrent neural network (RNN) (long short-term memory, gated recurrent unit) and CNN-RNN models, and the average accuracy and F1-score are both up to 83%. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The CNN framework that includes word segmentation, word embedding and model training can serve as an intelligent auxiliary diagnosis tool for pediatricians. Particularly, a fine-tuning one-layer CNN performs well, which indicates that word order does not appear to have a useful effect on our Chinese EMRs.","['1 College of Computer Science and Technology, Huaqiao University, Xiamen, 361021, China.', '2 College of Computer Science and Technology, Huaqiao University, Xiamen, 361021, China. wanghuazhen@hqu.edu.cn.', '3 Research Department, Zhiye software, Xiamen, 361021, China.', '4 Pediatric Department, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361003, China.']","Xiaozheng Li, Huazhen Wang, Huixin He, Jixiang Du, Jian Chen, Jinzhun Wu, ",BMC bioinformatics,2019,Chinese electronic medical records; Convolutional neural networks; Natural language processing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30709336
390,An Effective Dense Co-Attention Networks for Visual Question Answering,"At present, the state-of-the-art approaches of Visual Question Answering (VQA) mainly use the co-attention model to relate each visual object with text objects, which can achieve the coarse interactions between multimodalities. However, they ignore the dense self-attention within question modality. In order to solve this problem and improve the accuracy of VQA tasks, in the present paper, an effective Dense Co-Attention Networks (DCAN) is proposed. First, to better capture the relationship between words that are relatively far apart and make the extracted semantics more robust, the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) neural network is introduced to encode questions and answers; second, to realize the fine-grained interactions between the question words and image regions, a dense multimodal co-attention model is proposed. The model's basic components include the self-attention unit and the guided-attention unit, which are cascaded in depth to form a hierarchical structure. The experimental results on the VQA-v2 dataset show that DCAN has obvious performance advantages, which makes VQA applicable to a wider range of AI scenarios.","['1 College of Information Engineering, Shanghai Maritime University, Shanghai 201306, China.']","Shirong He, Dezhi Han, ","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2020,Bi-LSTM; computer vision; deep learning; dense co-attention network; natural language processing; visual question answering.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32872620
391,Automatic Disease Annotation From Radiology Reports Using Artificial Intelligence Implemented by a Recurrent Neural Network,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Radiology reports are rich resources for biomedical researchers. Before utilization of radiology reports, experts must manually review these reports to identify the categories. In fact, automatically categorizing electronic medical record (EMR) text with key annotation is difficult because it has a free-text format. To address these problems, we developed an automated system for disease annotation. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      Reports of musculoskeletal radiography examinations performed from January 1, 2016, through December 31, 2016, were exported from the database of Hanyang University Medical Center. After sentences not written in English and sentences containing typos were excluded, 3032 sentences were included. We built a system that uses a recurrent neural network (RNN) to automatically identify fracture and nonfracture cases as a preliminary study. We trained and tested the system using orthopedic surgeon-classified reports. We evaluated the system for the number of layers in the following two ways: the word error rate of the output sentences and performance as a binary classifier using standard evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Results:
      
    

    
      The word error rate using Levenshtein distance showed the best performance in the three-layer model at 1.03%. The three-layer model also showed the highest overall performance with the highest precision (0.967), recall (0.967), accuracy (0.982), and F1 score (0.967). Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Our results indicate that the RNN-based system has the ability to classify important findings in radiology reports with a high F1 score. We expect that our system can be used in cohort construction such as for retrospective studies because it is efficient for analyzing a large amount of data.","['1 1 Department of Biomedical Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea.', '2 2 Department of Orthopedic Surgery, College of Medicine, Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea.', '3 3 Institute of Innovative Surgical Technology, Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea.', '4 4 Center for Integration of Advanced Medicine Life Science Innovative Technologies, Department of Advanced Medical Initiatives, Kyushu University, 3-1-1, Maidashi, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka-shi, Fukuoka-ken 812-8582, Japan.']","Changhwan Lee, Yeesuk Kim, Young Soo Kim, Jongseong Jang, ",AJR.

      Natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning approaches were used to build classifiers to identify genomic-related treatment changes in the free-text visit progress notes of cancer patients. Methods:
      
    

    
      We obtained 5889 deidentified progress reports (2439 words on average) for 755 cancer patients who have undergone a clinical next generation sequencing (NGS) testing in Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center for our data analyses. An NLP system was implemented to process the free-text data and extract NGS-related information. Three types of recurrent neural network (RNN) namely, gated recurrent unit, long short-term memory (LSTM), and bidirectional LSTM (LSTM_Bi) were applied to classify documents to the treatment-change and no-treatment-change groups. Further, we compared the performances of RNNs to 5 machine learning algorithms including Naive Bayes, K-nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine for classification, Random forest, and Logistic Regression. Results:
      
    

    
      Our results suggested that, overall, RNNs outperformed traditional machine learning algorithms, and LSTM_Bi showed the best performance among the RNNs in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. In addition, pretrained word embedding can improve the accuracy of LSTM by 3.4% and reduce the training time by more than 60%. Discussion and conclusion:

394,Toward Complete Structured Information Extraction from Radiology Reports Using Machine Learning,"Unstructured and semi-structured radiology reports represent an underutilized trove of information for machine learning (ML)-based clinical informatics applications, including abnormality tracking systems, research cohort identification, point-of-care summarization, semi-automated report writing, and as a source of weak data labels for training image processing systems. Clinical ML systems must be interpretable to ensure user trust. To create interpretable models applicable to all of these tasks, we can build general-purpose systems which extract all relevant human-level assertions or ""facts"" documented in reports; identifying these facts is an information extraction (IE) task. Previous IE work in radiology has focused on a limited set of information, and extracts isolated entities (i.e., single words such as ""lesion"" or ""cyst"") rather than complete facts, which require the linking of multiple entities and modifiers. Here, we develop a prototype system to extract all useful information in abdominopelvic radiology reports (findings, recommendations, clinical history, procedures, imaging indications and limitations, etc.), in the form of complete, contextualized facts. We construct an information schema to capture the bulk of information in reports, develop real-time ML models to extract this information, and demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the system.","['1 Department of Radiology, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA. jacksonsteinkamp@gmail.com.', '2 Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, 02119, USA. jacksonsteinkamp@gmail.com.', '3 Department of Radiology, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA.']","Jackson M Steinkamp, Charles Chambers, Darco Lalevic, Hanna M Zafar, Tessa S Cook, ",Journal of digital imaging,2019 Aug,Machine learning; Natural language processing; Radiology reports; Structured reporting.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31218554
395,WordSeg: Standardizing unsupervised word form segmentation from text,"A basic task in first language acquisition likely involves discovering the boundaries between words or morphemes in input where these basic units are not overtly segmented. A number of unsupervised learning algorithms have been proposed in the last 20 years for these purposes, some of which have been implemented computationally, but whose results remain difficult to compare across papers. We created a tool that is open source, enables reproducible results, and encourages cumulative science in this domain. WordSeg has a modular architecture: It combines a set of corpora description routines, multiple algorithms varying in complexity and cognitive assumptions (including several that were not publicly available, or insufficiently documented), and a rich evaluation package. In the paper, we illustrate the use of this package by analyzing a corpus of child-directed speech in various ways, which further allows us to make recommendations for experimental design of follow-up work. Supplementary materials allow readers to reproduce every result in this paper, and detailed online instructions further enable them to go beyond what we have done. Moreover, the system can be installed within container software that ensures a stable and reliable environment. Finally, by virtue of its modular architecture and transparency, WordSeg can work as an open-source platform, to which other researchers can add their own segmentation algorithms.","[""1 LSCP, Département d'études Cognitives, ENS, EHESS, CNRS, PSL Research University, 29, rue d'Ulm, 75005, Paris, France."", '2 INRIA, Villers-lès-Nancy, France.', '3 Institute for Maternal and Child Health - IRCCS ""Burlo Garofolo"" - Trieste, Trieste, Italy.', '4 Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia.', '5 University of East Anglia, Norwich, UK.', '6 University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', ""7 LSCP, Département d'études Cognitives, ENS, EHESS, CNRS, PSL Research University, 29, rue d'Ulm, 75005, Paris, France. alecristia@gmail.com.""]","Mathieu Bernard, Roland Thiolliere, Amanda Saksida, Georgia R Loukatou, Elin Larsen, Mark Johnson, Laia Fibla, Emmanuel Dupoux, Robert Daland, Xuan Nga Cao, Alejandrina Cristia, ",Behavior research methods,2020 Feb,Cumulative science; First language acquisition; Natural language processing; Unsupervised word discovery.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30937845

      Mental illness affects a significant portion of the worldwide population. Online mental health forums can provide a supportive environment for those afflicted and also generate a large amount of data that can be mined to predict mental health states using machine learning methods. Objective:
      
    

    
      This study aimed to benchmark multiple methods of text feature representation for social media posts and compare their downstream use with automated machine learning (AutoML) tools. We tested on datasets that contain posts labeled for perceived suicide risk or moderator attention in the context of self-harm. Specifically, we assessed the ability of the methods to prioritize posts that a moderator would identify for immediate response. Methods:
      
    

    
      We used 1588 labeled posts from the Computational Linguistics and Clinical Psychology (CLPsych) 2017 shared task collected from the Reachout.com forum. Posts were represented using lexicon-based tools, including Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner, Empath, and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, and also using pretrained artificial neural network models, including DeepMoji, Universal Sentence Encoder, and Generative Pretrained Transformer-1 (GPT-1). We used Tree-based Optimization Tool and Auto-Sklearn as AutoML tools to generate classifiers to triage the posts. Results:
      
    

    
      The top-performing system used features derived from the GPT-1 model, which was fine-tuned on over 150,000 unlabeled posts from Reachout.com. Our top system had a macroaveraged F1 score of 0.572, providing a new state-of-the-art result on the CLPsych 2017 task. This was achieved without additional information from metadata or preceding posts. Error analyses revealed that this top system often misses expressions of hopelessness. In addition, we have presented visualizations that aid in the understanding of the learned classifiers. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      In this study, we found that transfer learning is an effective strategy for predicting risk with relatively little labeled data and noted that fine-tuning of pretrained language models provides further gains when large amounts of unlabeled text are available.","['1 Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada.', '2 Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada.', '3 Department of Biochemistry, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', '4 Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', '5 Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', '6 Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', '7 Institute for Medical Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', '8 Division of Brain and Therapeutics, Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.']","Derek Howard, Marta M Maslej, Justin Lee, Jacob Ritchie, Geoffrey Woollard, Leon French, ",Journal of medical Internet research,2020,"classification; data interpretation, statistical; machine learning; mental health; natural language processing; social support; transfer learning; triage.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32401222
397,A Computational Theory for the Emergence of Grammatical Categories in Cortical Dynamics,"A general agreement in psycholinguistics claims that syntax and meaning are unified precisely and very quickly during online sentence processing. Although several theories have advanced arguments regarding the neurocomputational bases of this phenomenon, we argue that these theories could potentially benefit by including neurophysiological data concerning cortical dynamics constraints in brain tissue. In addition, some theories promote the integration of complex optimization methods in neural tissue. In this paper we attempt to fill these gaps introducing a computational model inspired in the dynamics of cortical tissue. In our modeling approach, proximal afferent dendrites produce stochastic cellular activations, while distal dendritic branches-on the other hand-contribute independently to somatic depolarization by means of dendritic spikes, and finally, prediction failures produce massive firing events preventing formation of sparse distributed representations. The model presented in this paper combines semantic and coarse-grained syntactic constraints for each word in a sentence context until grammatically related word function discrimination emerges spontaneously by the sole correlation of lexical information from different sources without applying complex optimization methods. By means of support vector machine techniques, we show that the sparse activation features returned by our approach are well suited-bootstrapping from the features returned by Word Embedding mechanisms-to accomplish grammatical function classification of individual words in a sentence. In this way we develop a biologically guided computational explanation for linguistically relevant unification processes in cortex which connects psycholinguistics to neurobiological accounts of language. We also claim that the computational hypotheses established in this research could foster future work on biologically-inspired learning algorithms for natural language processing applications.","['1 Universidad de Buenos Aires, Facultad de Ingeniería, Instituto de Ingeniería Biomédica, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', '2 Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, IL, United States.', '3 Computer Science Department, Loyola University Chicago, Chicago, IL, United States.', '4 Microwaves in Medical Engineering Group, Division of Solid-State Electronics, Department of Electrical Engineering, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', '5 Centro Científico Tecnológico Conicet Mendoza, Instituto de Ciencias Humanas, Sociales y Ambientales, Mendoza, Argentina.', '6 Instituto de Biología y Medicina Experimental-CONICET, Buenos Aires, Argentina.']","Dario Dematties, Silvio Rizzi, George K Thiruvathukal, Mauricio David Pérez, Alejandro Wainselboim, B Silvano Zanutto, ",Frontiers in neural circuits,2020,brain-inspired artificial neural networks; computational linguistics; cortical dynamics; grammar emergence; online sentence processing; unsupervised learning.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32372918
398,Confirm or refute?: A comparative study on citation sentiment classification in clinical research publications,"Quantifying scientific impact of researchers and journals relies largely on citation counts, despite the acknowledged limitations of this approach. The need for more suitable alternatives has prompted research into developing advanced metrics, such as h-index and Relative Citation Ratio (RCR), as well as better citation categorization schemes to capture the various functions that citations serve in a publication. One such scheme involves citation sentiment: whether a reference paper is cited positively (agreement with the findings of the reference paper), negatively (disagreement), or neutrally. The ability to classify citation function in this manner can be viewed as a first step toward a more fine-grained bibliometrics. In this study, we compared several approaches, varying in complexity, for classification of citation sentiment in clinical trial publications. Using a corpus of 285 discussion sections from as many publications (a total of 4,182 citations), we developed a rule-based method as well as supervised machine learning models based on support vector machines (SVM) and two variants of deep neural networks; namely, convolutional neural network (CNN) and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM). A CNN model augmented with hand-crafted features yielded the best performance (0.882 accuracy and 0.721 macro-F1 on held-out set). Our results show that baseline performances of traditional supervised learning algorithms and deep neural network architectures are similar and that hand-crafted features based on sentiment dictionaries and rhetorical structure allow neural network approaches to outperform traditional machine learning approaches for this task.

399,Identifying Key Topics Bearing Negative Sentiment on Twitter: Insights Concerning the 2015-2016 Zika Epidemic,"Background:
      
    

    
      To understand the public sentiment regarding the Zika virus, social media can be leveraged to understand how positive, negative, and neutral sentiments are expressed in society. Specifically, understanding the characteristics of negative sentiment could help inform federal disease control agencies' efforts to disseminate relevant information to the public about Zika-related issues. Objective:
      
    

    
      The purpose of this study was to analyze the public sentiment concerning Zika using posts on Twitter and determine the qualitative characteristics of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments expressed. Methods:
      
    

    
      Machine learning techniques and algorithms were used to analyze the sentiment of tweets concerning Zika. A supervised machine learning classifier was built to classify tweets into 3 sentiment categories: positive, neutral, and negative. Tweets in each category were then examined using a topic-modeling approach to determine the main topics for each category, with focus on the negative category. Results:
      
    

    
      A total of 5303 tweets were manually annotated and used to train multiple classifiers. These performed moderately well (F1 score=0.48-0.68) with text-based feature extraction. All 48,734 tweets were then categorized into the sentiment categories. Overall, 10 topics for each sentiment category were identified using topic modeling, with a focus on the negative sentiment category. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our study demonstrates how sentiment expressed within discussions of epidemics on Twitter can be discovered. This allows public health officials to understand public sentiment regarding an epidemic and enables them to address specific elements of negative sentiment in real time. Our negative sentiment classifier was able to identify tweets concerning Zika with 3 broad themes: neural defects,Zika abnormalities, and reports and findings. These broad themes were based on domain expertise and from topics discussed in journals such as Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report and Vaccine. As the majority of topics in the negative sentiment category concerned symptoms, officials should focus on spreading information about prevention and treatment research.","['1 Computer Science and Engineering, Wright State University, Dayton, OH, United States.', '2 Department of Biological Sciences, Wright State University, Dayton, OH, United States.', '3 Kno.e.sis, Computer Science and Engineering, Wright State University, Dayton, OH, United States.']","Ravali Mamidi, Michele Miller, Tanvi Banerjee, William Romine, Amit Sheth, ",JMIR public health and surveillance,2019,Zika; epidemiology; infodemiology; infoveillance; machine learning; natural language processing; sentiment analysis; social media; twitter.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31165711
400,Knowledge synthesis of 100 million biomedical documents augments the deep expression profiling of coronavirus receptors,"The COVID-19 pandemic demands assimilation of all biomedical knowledge to decode mechanisms of pathogenesis. Despite the recent renaissance in neural networks, a platform for the real-time synthesis of the exponentially growing biomedical literature and deep omics insights is unavailable. Here, we present the nferX platform for dynamic inference from over 45 quadrillion possible conceptual associations from unstructured text, and triangulation with insights from single-cell RNA-sequencing, bulk RNA-seq and proteomics from diverse tissue types. A hypothesis-free profiling of ACE2 suggests tongue keratinocytes, olfactory epithelial cells, airway club cells and respiratory ciliated cells as potential reservoirs of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. We find the gut as the putative hotspot of COVID-19, where a maturation correlated transcriptional signature is shared in small intestine enterocytes among coronavirus receptors (ACE2, DPP4, ANPEP). A holistic data science platform triangulating insights from structured and unstructured data holds potential for accelerating the generation of impactful biological insights and hypotheses.","['1 nference, Cambridge, United States.', '2 nference Labs, Bengaluru, India.', '3 Janssen pharmaceutical companies of Johnson & Johnson (J&J), Spring House, United States.', '4 nference, Toronto, Canada.']","A J Venkatakrishnan, Arjun Puranik, Akash Anand, David Zemmour, Xiang Yao, Xiaoying Wu, Ramakrishna Chilaka, Dariusz K Murakowski, Kristopher Standish, Bharathwaj Raghunathan, Tyler Wagner, Enrique Garcia-Rivera, Hugo Solomon, Abhinav Garg, Rakesh Barve, Anuli Anyanwu-Ofili, Najat Khan, Venky Soundararajan, ",eLife,2020,COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; artificial intelligence; human; human biology; machine learning; medicine; natural language processing; single cell RNA-seq.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32463365

In terms of treatment, AI is being incorporated into digital interventions, particularly web and smartphone apps, to enhance user experience and optimise personalised mental health care. In terms of prediction and detection, modern streams of abundant data mean that data-driven AI methods can be employed to develop prediction/detection models for mental health conditions. In particular, an individual's 'digital exhaust', the data gathered from their numerous personal digital device and social media interactions, can be mined for behavioural or mental health insights. Language, long considered a window into the human mind, can now be quantitatively harnessed as data with powerful computer-based natural language processing to also provide a method of inferring mental health. Furthermore, natural language processing can also be used to develop conversational agents used for therapeutic intervention.","['1 The University of Melbourne School of Computing and Information Systems, Australia.

402,Differential 28-Days Cyclic Modulation of Affective Intensity in Female and Male Participants via Social Media,"The menstrual cycle affects many aspects of female physiology, from the immune system to behavioral and emotional regulation. It is unclear however if these physiological changes are reflected in everyday, naturalistic language production, and moreover whether these putative effects can be consistently quantified. Using a novel approach based on social networks, we characterized linguistic expression differences in female and male volunteers over the course of several months, while having no physiological or reported information of the female participants' menstrual cycles. We used a simple algorithm to quantify the linguistic affect intensity of 418 (184 females and 234 males) subjects using their social networks production and found a 7-day modulatory cycle of affect intensity that corresponds to labor-week fluctuations, with no significant difference by biological sex, and a 28-day cycle over which females are significantly different than males. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the menstrual cycle modulates affective features of naturalistic linguistic production.","['1 Immunopharmacology Lab, IQUIBICEN, Buenos Aires University, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', '2 Applied Artificial Intelligence Lab, ICC, CONICET, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', '3 Computational Biology Center, T.J.

The model has learned the basic features such as seed match at first 2-8 nucleotides starting at the 5' end and counting toward the 3' end. Also, it was able to predict G-U wobble base pair in seed region. While validating on experimentally validated data the model was able to predict on average 72% of miRNAs for specific mRNA and shows highest positive expression fold change of predicted targets on a microarray data generated using anti 25 miRNAs compare to other predicted tools.

404,Adverse drug event detection using reason assignments in FDA drug labels,"Adverse drug events (ADEs) are unintended incidents that involve the taking of a medication. ADEs pose significant health and financial problems worldwide. Information about ADEs can inform health care and improve patient safety. However, much of this information is buried in narrative texts and needs to be extracted with Natural Language Processing techniques, in order to be useful to computerized methods. ADEs can be found on drug labels, contained in the different sections such as descriptions of the drug's active components or more prominently in descriptions of studied side-effects. Extracting these automatically could be useful in triaging and processing drug reports. In this paper, we present three base methods consisting of a Conditional Random Field (CRF), a bi-directional Long Short Term Memory unit with a CRF layer (biLSTM+CRF), and a pre-trained Bi-directional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model. We also present several ensembles of the CRF and biLSTM+CRF methods for extracting ADEs and their Reason from FDA drug labels. We show that all three methods perform well on our task, and that combining the models through different ensemble methods can improve results, providing increases in recall for the majority class and improving precision for all other classes. We also show the potential of framing ADE extraction from drug labels as a multi-class classification task on the Reason, or type, of ADE.","['1 Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA.

405,Natural language processing of clinical mental health notes may add predictive value to existing suicide risk models,"Background:
      
    

    
      This study evaluated whether natural language processing (NLP) of psychotherapy note text provides additional accuracy over and above currently used suicide prediction models. Methods:
      
    

    
      We used a cohort of Veterans Health Administration (VHA) users diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) between 2004-2013. Using a case-control design, cases (those that died by suicide during the year following diagnosis) were matched to controls (those that remained alive). After selecting conditional matches based on having shared mental health providers, we chose controls using a 5:1 nearest-neighbor propensity match based on the VHA's structured Electronic Medical Records (EMR)-based suicide prediction model. For cases, psychotherapist notes were collected from diagnosis until death. For controls, psychotherapist notes were collected from diagnosis until matched case's date of death. After ensuring similar numbers of notes, the final sample included 246 cases and 986 controls. Notes were analyzed using Sentiment Analysis and Cognition Engine, a Python-based NLP package. The output was evaluated using machine-learning algorithms. The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated to determine models' predictive accuracy. Results:
      
    

    
      NLP derived variables offered small but significant predictive improvement (AUC = 0.58) for patients that had longer treatment duration. A small sample size limited predictive accuracy. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Study identifies a novel method for measuring suicide risk over time and potentially categorizing patient subgroups with distinct risk sensitivities. Findings suggest leveraging NLP derived variables from psychotherapy notes offers an additional predictive value over and above the VHA's state-of-the-art structured EMR-based suicide prediction model.

406,Use of Natural Language Processing Tools to Identify and Classify Periprosthetic Femur Fractures,"Background:
      
    

    
      Manual chart review is labor-intensive and requires specialized knowledge possessed by highly trained medical professionals. The cost and infrastructure challenges required to implement this is prohibitive for most hospitals. Natural language processing (NLP) tools are distinctive in their ability to extract critical information from unstructured text in the electronic health records. As a simple proof-of-concept for the potential application of NLP technology in total hip arthroplasty (THA), we examined its ability to identify periprosthetic femur fractures (PPFFx) followed by more complex Vancouver classification. Methods:
      
    

    
      PPFFx were identified among all THAs performed at a single academic institution between 1998 and 2016. A randomly selected training cohort (1538 THAs with 89 PPFFx cases) was used to develop the prototype NLP algorithm and an additional randomly selected cohort (2982 THAs with 84 PPFFx cases) was used to further validate the algorithm. Keywords to identify, and subsequently classify, Vancouver type PPFFx about THA were defined. The gold standard was confirmed by experienced orthopedic surgeons using chart and radiographic review. The algorithm was applied to consult and operative notes to evaluate language used by surgeons as a means to predict the correct pathology in the absence of a listed, precise diagnosis. Given the variability inherent to fracture descriptions by different surgeons, an iterative process was used to improve the algorithm during the training phase following error identification. Validation statistics were calculated using manual chart review as the gold standard. Results:
      
    

    
      In distinguishing PPFFx, the NLP algorithm demonstrated 100% sensitivity and 99.8% specificity. Among 84 PPFFx test cases, the algorithm demonstrated 78.6% sensitivity and 94.8% specificity in determining the correct Vancouver classification. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      NLP-enabled algorithms are a promising alternative to manual chart review for identifying THA outcomes. NLP algorithms applied to surgeon notes demonstrated excellent accuracy in delineating PPFFx, but accuracy was low for Vancouver classification subtype. This proof-of-concept study supports the use of NLP technology to extract THA-specific data elements from the unstructured text in electronic health records in an expeditious and cost-effective manner.

407,Natural Language Processing for Identification of Incidental Pulmonary Nodules in Radiology Reports,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      To develop natural language processing (NLP) to identify incidental lung nodules (ILNs) in radiology reports for assessment of management recommendations. Methods and materials:
      
    

    
      We searched the electronic health records for patients who underwent chest CT during 2014 and 2017, before and after implementation of a department-wide dictation macro of the Fleischner Society recommendations. We randomly selected 950 unstructured chest CT reports and reviewed manually for ILNs. An NLP tool was trained and validated against the manually reviewed set, for the task of automated detection of ILNs with exclusion of previously known or definitively benign nodules. For ILNs found in the training and validation sets, we assessed whether reported management recommendations agreed with Fleischner Society guidelines. The guideline concordance of management recommendations was compared between 2014 and 2017. Results:
      
    

    
      The NLP tool identified ILNs with sensitivity and specificity of 91.1% and 82.2%, respectively, in the validation set. Positive and negative predictive values were 59.7% and 97.0%. In reports of ILNs in the training and validation sets before versus after introduction of a Fleischner reporting macro, there was no difference in the proportion of reports with ILNs (108 of 500 [21.6%] versus 101 of 450 [22.4%]; P = .8), or in the proportion of reports with ILNs containing follow-up recommendations (75 of 108 [69.4%] versus 80 of 101 [79.2%]; P = .2]. Rates of recommendation guideline concordance were not significantly different before and after implementation of the standardized macro (52 of 75 [69.3%] versus 60 of 80 [75.0%]; P = .43). Conclusion:

409,A corpus-driven standardization framework for encoding clinical problems with HL7 FHIR,"Free-text problem descriptions are brief explanations of patient diagnoses and issues, commonly found in problem lists and other prominent areas of the medical record. These compact representations often express complex and nuanced medical conditions, making their semantics challenging to fully capture and standardize. In this study, we describe a framework for transforming free-text problem descriptions into standardized Health Level 7 (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) models. This approach leverages a combination of domain-specific dependency parsers, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) natural language models, and cui2vec Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) concept vectors to align extracted concepts from free-text problem descriptions into structured FHIR models. A neural network classification model is used to classify thirteen relationship types between concepts, facilitating mapping to the FHIR Condition resource. We use data programming, a weak supervision approach, to eliminate the need for a manually annotated training corpus. Shapley values, a mechanism to quantify contribution, are used to interpret the impact of model features. We found that our methods identified the focus concept, or primary clinical concern of the problem description, with an F1 score of 0.95. Relationships from the focus to other modifying concepts were extracted with an F1 score of 0.90. When classifying relationships, our model achieved a 0.89 weighted average F1 score, enabling accurate mapping of attributes into HL7 FHIR models. We also found that the BERT input representation predominantly contributed to the classifier decision as shown by the Shapley values analysis.","['1 Department of Information Technology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, United States; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Program, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, United States.

Therefore, learning distributed representations from temporal patterns of clinical notes is an essential step for downstream applications on EHR data. However, existing methods for EHR representation learning can not adequately capture either contextual information per-visit or temporal information at multiple visits. In this study, we developed a new vector embedding method called EHR2Vec that can learn semantically-meaningful representations of clinical concepts. EHR2Vec incorporated the self-attention structure and showed its utility in accurately identifying relevant clinical concept entities considering time sequence information from multiple visits.

415,Qualitative Assessment of Adult Patients' Perception of Atopic Dermatitis Using Natural Language Processing Analysis in a Cross-Sectional Study,"Introduction:
      
    

    
      Atopic dermatitis (AD) is an incurable, inflammatory skin disease characterized by skin barrier disruption and immune dysregulation. Although AD is considered a childhood disease, adult onset is possible, presenting with daily sleep disturbance and functional impairment associated with itch, neuropsychiatric issues (anxiety and depression), and reduced health-related quality of life. Although such aspects of adult AD disease burden have been measured through standardized assessments and based on population-level data, the understanding of the disease experienced at the patient level remains poor. This text-mining study assessed the impact of AD on the lives of adult patients as described from an experiential perspective. Methods:
      
    

    
      Natural language processing (NLP) was applied to qualitative patient response data from two large-scale international cross-sectional surveys conducted in the USA and countries outside of the USA (non-USA; Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK). Descriptive analysis was conducted on patient responses to an open-ended question on how they felt about their AD and how the disease affected their life. Character length, word count, and stop word (common words) count were evaluated; centrality analysis identified concepts that were most strongly interlinked. Results:
      
    

    
      Patients with AD in all countries were most frequently impacted by itch, pain, and embarrassment across all levels of disease severity. Patients with moderate-to-severe AD were more likely than patients with mild AD to describe sleep disturbances, fatigue, and feelings of depression, anxiety, and a lack of hope that were directly associated with AD. Centrality analysis revealed sleep disturbance was strongly linked with itch. Collectively, these concepts revealed that patients with AD are impacted by both physical and emotional burdens that are intricately connected. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Qualitative data from NLP, being more patient-centric than data from clinical standardized measures, provide a more comprehensive view of the burden of AD to inform disease management.","['1 Paris Sud University, Paris, France.', '2 Department of Dermatology, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', '3 Department of Dermatology and the Immunology Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', '4 Probity Medical Research, Waterloo, ON, Canada.', '5 Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nantes, Nantes, France.', '6 Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, NY, USA.', '7 Kantar-Health Division, Paris, France.', '8 Sanofi, Chilly-Mazarin, France.', '9 Sanofi, Chilly-Mazarin, France.

Low quality health information, which is common on the internet, presents risks to the patient in the form of misinformation and a possibly poorer relationship with their physician.

However, patients are unlikely to take the time to apply these criteria to the health websites they visit. Methods:
      
    

    
      We built an automated implementation of the DISCERN instrument (Brief version) using machine learning models. We compared the performance of a traditional model (Random Forest) with that of a hierarchical encoder attention-based neural network (HEA) model using two language embeddings, BERT and BioBERT. Results:
      
    

    
      The HEA BERT and BioBERT models achieved average F1-macro scores across all criteria of 0.75 and 0.74, respectively, outperforming the Random Forest model (average F1-macro = 0.69). Overall, the neural network based models achieved 81% and 86% average accuracy at 100% and 80% coverage, respectively, compared to 94% manual rating accuracy. The attention mechanism implemented in the HEA architectures not only provided 'model explainability' by identifying reasonable supporting sentences for the documents fulfilling the Brief DISCERN criteria, but also boosted F1 performance by 0.05 compared to the same architecture without an attention mechanism. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our research suggests that it is feasible to automate online health information quality assessment, which is an important step towards empowering patients to become informed partners in the healthcare process.","['1 Department of Quantitative Biomedicine, UZH, Schmelzbergstrasse 26, Zurich, Switzerland.', '2 Biomedical Informatics, University Hospital of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', '3 Department of Quantitative Biomedicine, UZH, Schmelzbergstrasse 26, Zurich, Switzerland. ahmed.allam@uzh.ch.', '4 Biomedical Informatics, University Hospital of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland. ahmed.allam@uzh.ch.', '5 Department of Pathology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, USA.']","Laura Kinkead, Ahmed Allam, Michael Krauthammer, ",BMC medical informatics and decision making,2020,Health communication; Information quality; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Neural networks.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32517759

418,Incidental durotomy: predictive risk model and external validation of natural language process identification algorithm,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Incidental durotomy is a common complication of elective lumbar spine surgery seen in up to 11% of cases. Prior studies have suggested patient age and body habitus along with a history of prior surgery as being associated with an increased risk of dural tear. To date, no calculator has been developed for quantifying risk. Here, the authors' aim was to identify independent predictors of incidental durotomy, present a novel predictive calculator, and externally validate a novel method to identify incidental durotomies using natural language processing (NLP). Methods:
      
    

    
      The authors retrospectively reviewed all patients who underwent elective lumbar spine procedures at a tertiary academic hospital for degenerative pathologies between July 2016 and November 2018. Data were collected regarding surgical details, patient demographic information, and patient medical comorbidities. The primary outcome was incidental durotomy, which was identified both through manual extraction and the NLP algorithm. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of incidental durotomy. Bootstrapping was then employed to estimate optimism in the model, which was corrected for; this model was converted to a calculator and deployed online. Results:
      
    

    
      Of the 1279 elective lumbar surgery patients included in this study, incidental durotomy occurred in 108 (8.4%). Risk factors for incidental durotomy on multivariable logistic regression were increased surgical duration, older age, revision versus index surgery, and case starts after 4 pm. This model had an area under curve (AUC) of 0.73 in predicting incidental durotomies. The previously established NLP method was used to identify cases of incidental durotomy, of which it demonstrated excellent discrimination (AUC 0.97). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Using multivariable analysis, the authors found that increased surgical duration, older patient age, cases started after 4 pm, and a history of prior spine surgery are all independent positive predictors of incidental durotomy in patients undergoing elective lumbar surgery. Additionally, the authors put forth the first version of a clinical calculator for durotomy risk that could be used prospectively by spine surgeons when counseling patients about their surgical risk. Lastly, the authors presented an external validation of an NLP algorithm used to identify incidental durotomies through the review of free-text operative notes. The authors believe that these tools can aid clinicians and researchers in their efforts to prevent this costly complication in spine surgery.","['1 1Department of Neurosurgery, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland; and.', '2 2Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.']","Jeff Ehresman, Zach Pennington, Aditya V Karhade, Sakibul Huq, Ravi Medikonda, Andrew Schilling, James Feghali, Andrew Hersh, A Karim Ahmed, Ethan Cottrill, Daniel Lubelski, Erick M Westbroek, Joseph H Schwab, Daniel M Sciubba, ",Journal of neurosurgery.

419,Lateralized Cerebral Processing of Abstract Linguistic Structure in Clear and Degraded Speech,"Human cortical activity measured with magnetoencephalography (MEG) has been shown to track the temporal regularity of linguistic information in connected speech. In the current study, we investigate the underlying neural sources of these responses and test the hypothesis that they can be directly modulated by changes in speech intelligibility. MEG responses were measured to natural and spectrally degraded (noise-vocoded) speech in 19 normal hearing participants. Results showed that cortical coherence to ""abstract"" linguistic units with no accompanying acoustic cues (phrases and sentences) were lateralized to the left hemisphere and changed parametrically with intelligibility of speech. In contrast, responses coherent to words/syllables accompanied by acoustic onsets were bilateral and insensitive to intelligibility changes. This dissociation suggests that cerebral responses to linguistic information are directly affected by intelligibility but also powerfully shaped by physical cues in speech. This explains why previous studies have reported widely inconsistent effects of speech intelligibility on cortical entrainment and, within a single experiment, provided clear support for conclusions about language lateralization derived from a large number of separately conducted neuroimaging studies. Since noise-vocoded speech resembles the signals provided by a cochlear implant device, the current methodology has potential clinical utility for assessment of cochlear implant performance.","['1 The HEARing CRC, Audiology, Hearing and Speech Sciences, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria 3053, Australia.', '2 Department of Cognitive Science, Macquarie University, Sydney, New South Wales 2109, Australia.', '3 Department of Linguistics, Macquarie University, Sydney, New South Wales 2109, Australia.', '4 MEG-Center, University of Tübingen, Tübingen 72074, Germany.', '5 H:EAR Centre, Macquarie University, New South Wales 2109, Australia.']","Qingqing Meng, Yiwen Li Hegner, Iain Giblin, Catherine McMahon, Blake W Johnson, ","Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)",2020,brain imaging; cochlear implant; lateralization of function; magnetoencephalography; speech intelligibility.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32901245

421,Cerebellar Activation During Reading Tasks: Exploring the Dichotomy Between Motor vs. Language Functions in Adults of Varying Reading Proficiency,"The nature and extent to which the cerebellum contributes to language processing is not clear. By using fMRI to examine differences in activation intensity in areas associated with motor and language processes, we advance our understanding of how this subcortical structure contributes to language and, more specifically, reading. Functional magnetic resonance imaging data was collected from two groups of adults. One group was classified as typical (proficient) readers, and the other as atypical (less proficient) readers. fMRI was used to measure cerebellar activation during silent reading and silent rapid naming tasks, which differed in degree of language and motor/articulatory processing. Regions of interest associated with motor and language processing were examined in order to compare how cerebellar activation in typical and atypical readers differed as a function of task both within and between groups. Significant differences in activation intensity were noted between individuals of typical and atypical reading proficiency in cerebellar regions associated with motor, but not language processing, during a silent word-reading condition. Additionally, readers who were less proficient showed no differences in activation between tasks in each of the regions of interest within the cerebellum. We provide evidence that, in typical readers, the cerebellum is functionally specialized for reading tasks that vary in language and articulatory processes. In accordance with prior research, we demonstrate that less-proficient adult readers show decreased functional specialization within the cerebellum during reading tasks. We also show that regions of the cerebellum associated with motor/articulatory processing are different between typical and atypically reading adults. Finally, to our knowledge, this is the first brain-imaging study to specifically examine cerebellar activation during rapid naming tasks and we discuss the implications for these findings with regard to current theoretical models that emphasize the link between reading and speech production.","['1 Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders, Faculty of Rehabilitation Medicine, University of Alberta, 2-70 8205 114 Street, Edmonton, AB, T6G 2G4, Canada. acasson@ualberta.ca.', '2 Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders, Faculty of Rehabilitation Medicine, University of Alberta, 2-70 8205 114 Street, Edmonton, AB, T6G 2G4, Canada.', '3 Institute for Reconstructive Sciences in Medicine, Edmonton, Canada.', '4 Neuroscience and Mental Health Institute, Edmonton, Canada.']","Angela Cullum, William E Hodgetts, Trelani F Milburn, Jacqueline Cummine, ","Cerebellum (London, England)",2019 Aug,Cerebellum; Dyslexia; Reading; Speech production; fMRI.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30949938
422,Integrating shortest dependency path and sentence sequence into a deep learning framework for relation extraction in clinical text,"Background:
      
    

    
      Extracting relations between important clinical entities is critical but very challenging for natural language processing (NLP) in the medical domain. Researchers have applied deep learning-based approaches to clinical relation extraction; but most of them consider sentence sequence only, without modeling syntactic structures. The aim of this study was to utilize a deep neural network to capture the syntactic features and further improve the performances of relation extraction in clinical notes. Methods:
      
    

    
      We propose a novel neural approach to model shortest dependency path (SDP) between target entities together with the sentence sequence for clinical relation extraction. Our neural network architecture consists of three modules: (1) sentence sequence representation module using bidirectional long short-term memory network (Bi-LSTM) to capture the features in the sentence sequence; (2) SDP representation module implementing the convolutional neural network (CNN) and Bi-LSTM network to capture the syntactic context for target entities using SDP information; and (3) classification module utilizing a fully-connected layer with Softmax function to classify the relation type between target entities. Results:
      
    

    
      Using the 2010 i2b2/VA relation extraction dataset, we compared our approach with other baseline methods. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach achieved significant improvements over comparable existing methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of utilizing syntactic structures in deep learning-based relation extraction. The F-measure of our method reaches 74.34% which is 2.5% higher than the method without using syntactic features. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We propose a new neural network architecture by modeling SDP along with sentence sequence to extract multi-relations from clinical text.

      To comparatively evaluate a range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches for Information Extraction (IE) of low-prevalence concepts in clinical notes on the example of decline of insulin therapy recommendation by patients. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      We evaluated the accuracy of detection of documentation of decline of insulin therapy by patients using sentence-level naïve Bayes, logistic regression and support vector machine (SVM)-based classification (with and without SMOTE oversampling), token-level sequence labelling using conditional random fields (CRFs), uni- and bi-directional recurrent neural network (RNN) models with GRU and LSTM cells, and rule-based detection using Canary platform. All models were trained using the same manually annotated 50,046-document training set and evaluated on the same 1501-document held-out set. Hyperparameter optimization was performed using 10-fold cross-validation. Results:
      
    

    
      At the sentence level, prevalence of documentation of decline of insulin therapy by patients was 0.02% in both training and held-out sets. Naïve Bayes and logistic regression models did not achieve F1 score ≥ 0.5 on the training set and were not further evaluated. Among the other models, evaluation against the held-out test set showed that SVM identified decline of insulin therapy by patients with F1 score of 0.61, CRF with F1 of 0.51, RNN with F1 of 0.67 and Canary rule-based model with F1 of 0.97.

424,Automated feature selection of predictors in electronic medical records data,"The use of Electronic Health Records (EHR) for translational research can be challenging due to difficulty in extracting accurate disease phenotype data. Historically, EHR algorithms for annotating phenotypes have been either rule-based or trained with billing codes and gold standard labels curated via labor intensive medical chart review. These simplistic algorithms tend to have unpredictable portability across institutions and low accuracy for many disease phenotypes due to imprecise billing codes. Recently, more sophisticated machine learning algorithms have been developed to improve the robustness and accuracy of EHR phenotyping algorithms. These algorithms are typically trained via supervised learning, relating gold standard labels to a wide range of candidate features including billing codes, procedure codes, medication prescriptions and relevant clinical concepts extracted from narrative notes via Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, due to the time intensiveness of gold standard labeling, the size of the training set is often insufficient to build a generalizable algorithm with the large number of candidate features extracted from EHR. To reduce the number of candidate predictors and in turn improve model performance, we present an automated feature selection method based entirely on unlabeled observations. The proposed method generates a comprehensive surrogate for the underlying phenotype with an unsupervised clustering of disease status based on several highly predictive features such as diagnosis codes and mentions of the disease in text fields available in the entire set of EHR data. A sparse regression model is then built with the estimated outcomes and remaining covariates to identify those features most informative of the phenotype of interest. Relying on the results of Li and Duan (1989), we demonstrate that variable selection for the underlying phenotype model can be achieved by fitting the surrogate-based model. We explore the performance of our methods in numerical simulations and present the results of a prediction model for Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) built on a large EHR data mart from the Partners Health System consisting of billing codes and NLP terms. Empirical results suggest that our procedure reduces the number of gold-standard labels necessary for phenotyping thereby harnessing the automated power of EHR data and improving efficiency.","['1 Department of Biomedical Data Science, Stanford University, Stanford, California.', '2 OHSU-PSU School of Public Health, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon.', '3 Center for Statistical Science, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.', ""4 Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts."", '5 Department of Biostatistics, Harvard University, Boston, Massachusetts.']","Jessica Gronsbell, Jessica Minnier, Sheng Yu, Katherine Liao, Tianxi Cai, ",Biometrics,2019 Mar,electronic medical records; feature selection; prediction accuracy; regularized regression; risk prediction.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30353541

Data integration and data sharing will be essential to achieve these goals. Our work focuses on the development of a framework process for the integration of data from different sources to increase its usability potential. We integrated data from an internal hospital database, external data, and also structured data resulting from natural language processing (NPL) applied to electronic medical records.

Using Natural Language Processing (NLP), we analyzed words PwE and People without Epilepsy (PwoE) chose to express their reactions. Methods: As a subset of a larger survey, we collected from both PwE (427) and PwoE (452) single words (one per subject) associated to the period of lock down. The survey was spread thanks to the efforts of Italian league against epilepsy Foundation during the days of maximum raise of the pandemic. Data were analyzed via bag of word and sentiment analysis techniques in R. Results: PwoE and PwE showed significantly different distribution in word choice (X2, p = 4.904e-13). A subset of subject used positive words to describe this period, subjects with positive feelings about the lock down were more represented in the PwE group (X2, p = 0.045). Conclusion: PwoE developed reactive stress response to the restrictions enacted during lock-down. PwE, instead, chose words expressing sadness and concern with their disease. PwE appear to internalize more the trauma of lock down. Interestingly PwE also expressed positive feelings about this period of isolation more frequently than PwoE.

427,Between Always and Never: Evaluating Uncertainty in Radiology Reports Using Natural Language Processing,"The ideal radiology report reduces diagnostic uncertainty, while avoiding ambiguity whenever possible. The purpose of this study was to characterize the use of uncertainty terms in radiology reports at a single institution and compare the use of these terms across imaging modalities, anatomic sections, patient characteristics, and radiologist characteristics. We hypothesized that there would be variability among radiologists and between subspecialities within radiology regarding the use of uncertainty terms and that the length of the impression of a report would be a predictor of use of uncertainty terms. Finally, we hypothesized that use of uncertainty terms would often be interpreted by human readers as ""hedging."" To test these hypotheses, we applied a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm to assess and count the number of uncertainty terms within radiology reports. An algorithm was created to detect usage of a published set of uncertainty terms. All 642,569 radiology report impressions from 171 reporting radiologists were collected from 2011 through 2015. For validation, two radiologists without knowledge of the software algorithm reviewed report impressions and were asked to determine whether the report was ""uncertain"" or ""hedging."" The relationship between the presence of 1 or more uncertainty terms and the human readers' assessment was compared. There were significant differences in the proportion of reports containing uncertainty terms across patient admission status and across anatomic imaging subsections. Reports with uncertainty were significantly longer than those without, although report length was not significantly different between subspecialities or modalities. There were no significant differences in rates of uncertainty when comparing the experience of the attending radiologist. When compared with reader 1 as a gold standard, accuracy was 0.91, sensitivity was 0.92, specificity was 0.9, and precision was 0.88, with an F1-score of 0.9. When compared with reader 2, accuracy was 0.84, sensitivity was 0.88, specificity was 0.82, and precision was 0.68, with an F1-score of 0.77. Substantial variability exists among radiologists and subspecialities regarding the use of uncertainty terms, and this variability cannot be explained by years of radiologist experience or differences in proportions of specific modalities. Furthermore, detection of uncertainty terms demonstrates good test characteristics for predicting human readers' assessment of uncertainty.","['1 Department of Radiology, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Denver, CO, USA. andrew.callen@cuanschutz.edu.', '2 Sublte Medical Inc, Menlo Park, CA, USA.', '3 Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', '4 Department of Radiology, Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, CA, USA.']","Andrew L Callen, Sara M Dupont, Adi Price, Ben Laguna, David McCoy, Bao Do, Jason Talbott, Marc Kohli, Jared Narvid, ",Journal of digital imaging,2020,Diagnostic uncertainty; Natural language processing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32813098

      Abnormalities in the semantic and syntactic organization of speech have been reported in individuals at clinical high-risk (CHR) for psychosis. The current study seeks to examine whether such abnormalities are associated with changes in brain structure and functional connectivity in CHR individuals. Methods.:
      
    

    
      Automated natural language processing analysis was applied to speech samples obtained from 46 CHR and 22 healthy individuals. Brain structural and resting-state functional imaging data were also acquired from all participants. Sparse canonical correlation analysis (sCCA) was used to ascertain patterns of covariation between linguistic features, clinical symptoms, and measures of brain morphometry and functional connectivity related to the language network. Results.:
      
    

    
      In CHR individuals, we found a significant mode of covariation between linguistic and clinical features (r = 0.73; p = 0.003), with negative symptoms and bizarre thinking covarying mostly with measures of syntactic complexity. In the entire sample, separate sCCAs identified a single mode of covariation linking linguistic features with brain morphometry (r = 0.65; p = 0.05) and resting-state network connectivity (r = 0.63; p = 0.01). In both models, semantic and syntactic features covaried with brain structural and functional connectivity measures of the language network. However, the contribution of diagnosis to both models was negligible. Conclusions.:
      
    

    
      Syntactic complexity appeared sensitive to prodromal symptoms in CHR individuals while the patterns of brain-language covariation seemed preserved.

This study is one of the few to focus on factors predicting self-labeling as a survivor among self-acknowledged rape victims by evaluating the contribution of the time span of the rape narrative, rape terminology, and expression of faith. Method:
      
    

    
      The data were elicited from 3,794 rape narratives published on Brave Miss World, a website established, inter alia, to allow rape victims to share their stories. To identify the key concepts within rape narratives, we performed text mining based on natural language processing (NLP) and developed a model. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test the model's goodness-of-fit analysis. Results:
      
    

    
      The results indicated a good fit between the theoretical model and the data. Time predicted expressions of faith and the use of rape terminology, and there was a positive correlation between faith and the use of rape terminology. Both expressions of faith and the use of rape terminology mediated between time span and self-labeling as a survivor, with a significant positive effect on self-labeling as a survivor. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The results suggest that addressing rape-victim faith and the use of rape terminology in the depiction of their sexual trauma may be beneficial for the therapeutic process and postrape recovery.

432,SemNet: Using Local Features to Navigate the Biomedical Concept Graph,"Literature-Based Discovery (LBD) aims to connect scientists across silos by assembling models of the literature to reveal previously hidden connections. Unfortunately, LBD systems have been unable to achieve user adoption on a large scale. This work develops opens source software in Python to convert a database of semantic predications of all of PubMed's 27.9 million indexed abstracts into a semantic inference network and biomedical concept graph in Neo4j. The developed software, called SemNet, queries a modified version of the publicly available SemMedDB and computes feature vectors on source-target pairs. Each unique United Medical Language System (UMLS) concept is represented as a node and each predication as an edge. Each node is assigned one of 132 node labels (e.g., Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein (AAPP); Gene or Genome (GG); etc.) and each edge is labeled with one of 58 predications (e.g. treats, causes, inhibits, etc.). SemNet computes a single feature value for each metapath, or sequence of node types, between a source node and user-specified target node(s). Several different types of metapath-based features (count, degree weighted path count, and HeteSim metric) are computed and vectorized. SemNet employs an unsupervised learning algorithm for rank aggregation (ULARA) to rank identified source nodes that are most relevant to the user-specified target nodes(s). Statistical analysis of correlation among identified source nodes or resultant literature network features are used to identify patterns that can guide future research. Analysis of high residual nodes is used to compare and contrast SemNet rankings between different targets of interest. An example SemNet use case is presented to assess ""the differential impact of smoking on cognition in males and females"" using the following target nodes: nicotine, learning, memory, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cigarette smoke, X chromosome, and Y chromosome. Detailed rankings are discussed. Overall results suggest a hypothesis where smoking negatively impacts cognition to a greater extent in females, but smoking has stronger cardiovascular impacts in males. In summary, SemNet provides an adoptable method for efficient LBD of PubMed that extends beyond omics-only relationships to true multi-scalar connections that can provide actionable insight for predictive medicine, research prioritization, and clinical care.","['1 Laboratory for Pathology Dynamics, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, United States.']","Andrew R Sedler, Cassie S Mitchell, ",Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology,2019,Python; literature based discovery; natural language processing; text mining; unsupervised learning.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31334227

434,Assessing the Heterogeneity of Complaints Related to Tinnitus and Hyperacusis from an Unsupervised Machine Learning Approach: An Exploratory Study,"Introduction:
      
    

    
      Subjective tinnitus (ST) and hyperacusis (HA) are common auditory symptoms that may become incapacitating in a subgroup of patients who thereby seek medical advice. Both conditions can result from many different mechanisms, and as a consequence, patients may report a vast repertoire of associated symptoms and comorbidities that can reduce dramatically the quality of life and even lead to suicide attempts in the most severe cases. The present exploratory study is aimed at investigating patients' symptoms and complaints using an in-depth statistical analysis of patients' natural narratives in a real-life environment in which, thanks to the anonymization of contributions and the peer-to-peer interaction, it is supposed that the wording used is totally free of any self-limitation and self-censorship. Methods:
      
    

    
      We applied a purely statistical, non-supervised machine learning approach to the analysis of patients' verbatim exchanged on an Internet forum. After automated data extraction, the dataset has been preprocessed in order to make it suitable for statistical analysis. We used a variant of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm to reveal clusters of symptoms and complaints of HA patients (topics). The probability of distribution of words within a topic uniquely characterizes it. The convergence of the log-likelihood of the LDA-model has been reached after 2,000 iterations. Several statistical parameters have been tested for topic modeling and word relevance factor within each topic. Results:
      
    

    
      Despite a rather small dataset, this exploratory study demonstrates that patients' free speeches available on the Internet constitute a valuable material for machine learning and statistical analysis aimed at categorizing ST/HA complaints. The LDA model with K = 15 topics seems to be the most relevant in terms of relative weights and correlations with the capability to individualizing subgroups of patients displaying specific characteristics. The study of the relevance factor may be useful to unveil weak but important signals that are present in patients' narratives. Discussion/conclusion:
      
    

    
      We claim that the LDA non-supervised approach would permit to gain knowledge on the patterns of ST- and HA-related complaints and on patients' centered domains of interest. The merits and limitations of the LDA algorithms are compared with other natural language processing methods and with more conventional methods of qualitative analysis of patients' output. Future directions and research topics emerging from this innovative algorithmic analysis are proposed.","['1 PainkillAR, TELECOM ParisTech, Paris, France.', '2 Laboratoire de Neurosciences Sensorielles et Cognitives, UMR CNRS 7260, Aix-Marseille Université, Marseille, France.', ""3 Hôpital Européen Georges-Pompidou, Service d'Oto-Rhino-Laryngologie et Chirurgie Cervico-Faciale, Paris, France, londeroa@gmail.com.""]","Guillaume Palacios, Arnaud Noreña, Alain Londero, ",Audiology & neuro-otology,2020,Computational predictive medicine; Hyperacusis; Machine learning; Text mining; Tinnitus.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32062654
435,A systematic literature review of automatic Alzheimer's disease detection from speech and language,"Objective:
      
    

    
      In recent years numerous studies have achieved promising results in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection using automatic language processing. We systematically review these articles to understand the effectiveness of this approach, identify any issues and report the main findings that can guide further research. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      We searched PubMed, Ovid, and Web of Science for articles published in English between 2013 and 2019. We performed a systematic literature review to answer 5 key questions: (1) What were the characteristics of participant groups? (2) What language data were collected? (3) What features of speech and language were the most informative? (4) What methods were used to classify between groups? (5) What classification performance was achieved? Results and discussion:
      
    

    
      We identified 33 eligible studies and 5 main findings: participants' demographic variables (especially age ) were often unbalanced between AD and control group; spontaneous speech data were collected most often; informative language features were related to word retrieval and semantic, syntactic, and acoustic impairment; neural nets, support vector machines, and decision trees performed well in AD detection, and support vector machines and decision trees performed well in decline detection; and average classification accuracy was 89% in AD and 82% in mild cognitive impairment detection versus healthy control groups. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The systematic literature review supported the argument that language and speech could successfully be used to detect dementia automatically. Future studies should aim for larger and more balanced datasets, combine data collection methods and the type of information analyzed, focus on the early stages of the disease, and report performance using standardized metrics.","['1 Department of Theoretical and Applied Linguistics, University of Cambridge, Language Technology Lab, Cambridge, UK.']","Ulla Petti, Simon Baker, Anna Korhonen, ",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2020,Alzheimer’s disease; dementia; language; natural language processing; speech.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32929494
436,Ontology-based venous thromboembolism risk assessment model developing from medical records,"Background:
      
    

    
      Padua linear model is widely used for the risk assessment of venous thromboembolism (VTE), a common but preventable complication for inpatients. However, genetic and environmental differences between Western and Chinese population limit the validity of Padua model in Chinese patients. Medical records which contain rich information about disease progression, are useful in mining new risk factors related to Chinese VTE patients. Furthermore, machine learning (ML) methods provide new opportunities to build precise risk prediction model by automatic selection of risk factors based on original medical records. Methods:
      
    

    
      Medical records of 3,106 inpatients including 224 VTE patients were collected and various types of ontologies were integrated to parse unstructured text. A workflow of ontology-based VTE risk prediction model, that combines natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) technologies, was proposed. Firstly ontology terms were extracted from medical records, then sorted according to their calculated weights. Next importance of each term in the unit of section was evaluated and finally a ML model was built based on a subset of terms. Four ML methods were tested, and the best model was decided by comparing area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Results:
      
    

    
      Medical records were first split into different sections and subsequently, terms from each section were sorted by their weights calculated by multiple types of information. Greedy selection algorithm was used to obtain significant sections and terms. Top terms in each section were selected to construct patients' distributed representations by word embedding technique. Using top 300 terms of two important sections, namely the 'Progress Note' section and 'Admitting Diagnosis' section, the model showed relatively better predictive performance. Then ML model which utilizes a subset of terms from two sections, about 110 terms, achieved the best AUC score, of 0.973 ± 0.006, which was significantly better compared to the Padua's performance of 0.791 ± 0.022. Terms found by the model showed their potential to help clinicians explore new risk factors. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      In this study, a new VTE risk assessment model based on ontologies extraction from raw medical records is developed and its performance is verified on real clinical dataset. Results of selected terms can help clinicians to discover meaningful risk factors.","['1 Department of Computer Science and Technology, Institute for Artificial Intelligence, State Key Lab of Intelligent Technology and Systems, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China.', '2 Tsinghua-Fuzhou Institute of Digital Technology, Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China.', '3 Department of Ultrasound, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Beijing, China.', '4 Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.', '5 Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China. shijh@pumch.cn.', '6 Department of Respiration, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Beijing, China. shijh@pumch.cn.', '7 Department of Computer Science and Technology, Institute for Artificial Intelligence, State Key Lab of Intelligent Technology and Systems, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China. tingchen@tsinghua.edu.cn.', '8 Tsinghua-Fuzhou Institute of Digital Technology, Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China. tingchen@tsinghua.edu.cn.']","Yuqing Yang, Xin Wang, Yu Huang, Ning Chen, Juhong Shi, Ting Chen, ",BMC medical informatics and decision making,2019,Machine learning (ML); Medical record; Natural language processing (NLP); Risk assessment; Venous thromboembolism (VTE).,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31391095
437,Smoothing dense spaces for improved relation extraction between drugs and adverse reactions,"Background and objective:
      
    

    
      This work aims at extracting Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs), i.e. a harm directly caused by a drug at normal doses, from Electronic Health Records (EHRs). The lack of readily available EHRs because of confidentiality issues and their lexical variability make the ADR extraction challenging. Furthermore, ADRs are rare events. Therefore, efficient representations against data sparsity are needed. Methods:
      
    

    
      Embedding-based characterizations are able to group semantically related words. However, dense spaces suffer from data sparsity. We employed context-aware continuous representations to enhance the modelling of infrequent events through their context and we turned to simple smoothing techniques to increase the proximity between similar words (e.g. direction cosines, truncation, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering) in an attempt to cope with data sparsity. Results:
      
    

    
      An F-measure of 0.639 for the ADR classification was achieved, obtaining an improvement of approximately 0.300 in comparison with the results obtained by a word-based characterization. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The embbeding-based representation together with the smoothing techniques increased the robustness of the ADR characterization. It was proven particularly appropriate to cope with lexical variability and data sparsity.","['1 IXA group, University of the Basque Country (UPV-EHU), Manuel Lardizabal 1, 20080 Donostia, Spain.

438,Serendipity-A Machine-Learning Application for Mining Serendipitous Drug Usage From Social Media,"Serendipitous drug usage refers to the unexpected relief of comorbid diseases or symptoms when taking medication for a different known indication. Historically, serendipity has contributed significantly to identifying many new drug indications. If patient-reported serendipitous drug usage in social media could be computationally identified, it could help generate and validate drug-repositioning hypotheses. We investigated deep neural network models for mining serendipitous drug usage from social media. We used the word2vec algorithm to construct word-embedding features from drug reviews posted in a WebMD patient forum. We adapted and redesigned the convolutional neural network, long short-term memory network, and convolutional long short-term memory network by adding contextual information extracted from drug-review posts, information-filtering tools, medical ontology, and medical knowledge. We trained, tuned, and evaluated our models with a gold-standard dataset of 15714 sentences (447 [2.8%] describing serendipitous drug usage). Additionally, we compared our deep neural networks to support vector machine, random forest, and AdaBoost.M1 algorithms. Context information helped to reduce the false-positive rate of deep neural network models. If we used an extremely imbalanced dataset with limited instances of serendipitous drug usage, deep neural network models did not outperform other machine-learning models with n-gram and context features. However, deep neural network models could more effectively use word embedding in feature construction, an advantage that makes them worthy of further investigation. Finally, we implemented natural-language processing and machine-learning methods in a web-based application to help scientists and software developers mine social media for serendipitous drug usage.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Boshu Ru, Dingcheng Li, Yueqi Hu, Lixia Yao, ",IEEE transactions on nanobioscience,2019 Jul,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30951476
439,"Understanding spatial language in radiology: Representation framework, annotation, and spatial relation extraction from chest X-ray reports using deep learning","Radiology reports contain a radiologist's interpretations of images, and these images frequently describe spatial relations. Important radiographic findings are mostly described in reference to an anatomical location through spatial prepositions. Such spatial relationships are also linked to various differential diagnoses and often described through uncertainty phrases. Structured representation of this clinically significant spatial information has the potential to be used in a variety of downstream clinical informatics applications. Our focus is to extract these spatial representations from the reports. For this, we first define a representation framework based on the Spatial Role Labeling (SpRL) scheme, which we refer to as Rad-SpRL. In Rad-SpRL, common radiological entities tied to spatial relations are encoded through four spatial roles: Trajector, Landmark, Diagnosis, and Hedge, all identified in relation to a spatial preposition (or Spatial Indicator). We annotated a total of 2,000 chest X-ray reports following Rad-SpRL. We then propose a deep learning-based natural language processing (NLP) method involving word and character-level encodings to first extract the Spatial Indicators followed by identifying the corresponding spatial roles. Specifically, we use a bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) conditional random field (CRF) neural network as the baseline model. Additionally, we incorporate contextualized word representations from pre-trained language models (BERT and XLNet) for extracting the spatial information. We evaluate both gold and predicted Spatial Indicators to extract the four types of spatial roles. The results are promising, with the highest average F1 measure for Spatial Indicator extraction being 91.29 (XLNet); the highest average overall F1 measure considering all the four spatial roles being 92.9 using gold Indicators (XLNet); and 85.6 using predicted Indicators (BERT pre-trained on MIMIC notes).

440,Acceptance Prediction for Answers on Online Health-care Community,"Background:
      
    

    
      With the development of e-Health, it plays a more and more important role in predicting whether a doctor's answer can be accepted by a patient through online healthcare community. Unlike the previous work which focus mainly on the numerical feature, in our framework, we combine both numerical and textual information to predict the acceptance of answers. The textual information is composed of questions posted by the patients and answers posted by the doctors. To extract the textual features from them, we first trained a sentence encoder to encode a pair of question and answer into a co-dependent representation on a held-out dataset. After that,we can use it to predict the acceptance of answers by doctors. Results:
      
    

    
      Our experimental results on the real-world dataset demonstrate that by applying our model additional features from text can be extracted and the prediction can be more accurate. That's to say, the model which take both textual features and numerical features as input performs significantly better than model which takes numerical features only on all the four metrics (Accuracy, AUC, F1-score and Recall). Conclusions:

441,Latent Dirichlet Allocation in predicting clinical trial terminations,"Background:
      
    

    
      This study used natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques to identify reliable patterns from within research narrative documents to distinguish studies that complete successfully, from the ones that terminate. Recent research findings have reported that at least 10 % of all studies that are funded by major research funding agencies terminate without yielding useful results. Since it is well-known that scientific studies that receive funding from major funding agencies are carefully planned, and rigorously vetted through the peer-review process, it was somewhat daunting to us that study-terminations are this prevalent. Moreover, our review of the literature about study terminations suggested that the reasons for study terminations are not well understood. We therefore aimed to address that knowledge gap, by seeking to identify the factors that contribute to study failures. Method:
      
    

    
      We used data from the clinicialTrials.gov repository, from which we extracted both structured data (study characteristics), and unstructured data (the narrative description of the studies). We applied natural language processing techniques to the unstructured data to quantify the risk of termination by identifying distinctive topics that are more frequently associated with trials that are terminated and trials that are completed. We used the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) technique to derive 25 ""topics"" with corresponding sets of probabilities, which we then used to predict study-termination by utilizing random forest modeling. We fit two distinct models - one using only structured data as predictors and another model with both structured data and the 25 text topics derived from the unstructured data. Results:
      
    

    
      In this paper, we demonstrate the interpretive and predictive value of LDA as it relates to predicting clinical trial failure. The results also demonstrate that the combined modeling approach yields robust predictive probabilities in terms of both sensitivity and specificity, relative to a model that utilizes the structured data alone. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our study demonstrated that the use of topic modeling using LDA significantly raises the utility of unstructured data in better predicating the completion vs. termination of studies.

442,Word and Sentence Embedding Tools to Measure Semantic Similarity of Gene Ontology Terms by Their Definitions,"The gene ontology (GO) database contains GO terms that describe biological functions of genes. Previous methods for comparing GO terms have relied on the fact that GO terms are organized into a tree structure. Under this paradigm, the locations of two GO terms in the tree dictate their similarity score. In this article, we introduce two new solutions for this problem by focusing instead on the definitions of the GO terms. We apply neural network-based techniques from the natural language processing (NLP) domain. The first method does not rely on the GO tree, whereas the second indirectly depends on the GO tree. In our first approach, we compare two GO definitions by treating them as two unordered sets of words. The word similarity is estimated by a word embedding model that maps words into an N-dimensional space. In our second approach, we account for the word-ordering within a sentence. We use a sentence encoder to embed GO definitions into vectors and estimate how likely one definition entails another. We validate our methods in two ways. In the first experiment, we test the model's ability to differentiate a true protein-protein network from a randomly generated network. In the second experiment, we test the model in identifying orthologs from randomly matched genes in human, mouse, and fly. In both experiments, a hybrid of NLP and GO tree-based method achieves the best classification accuracy.","['1 1 Department of Computer Science, University of California, Los Angeles, California.', '2 2 Department of Human Genetics, and University of California, Los Angeles, California.', '3 3 Department of Statistics, University of California, Los Angeles, California.']","Dat Duong, Wasi Uddin Ahmad, Eleazar Eskin, Kai-Wei Chang, Jingyi Jessica Li, ",Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell biology,2019 Jan,gene ontology; natural language processing; semantic similarity.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30383443
443,Racial disparities in automated speech recognition,"Automated speech recognition (ASR) systems, which use sophisticated machine-learning algorithms to convert spoken language to text, have become increasingly widespread, powering popular virtual assistants, facilitating automated closed captioning, and enabling digital dictation platforms for health care. Over the last several years, the quality of these systems has dramatically improved, due both to advances in deep learning and to the collection of large-scale datasets used to train the systems. There is concern, however, that these tools do not work equally well for all subgroups of the population. Here, we examine the ability of five state-of-the-art ASR systems-developed by Amazon, Apple, Google, IBM, and Microsoft-to transcribe structured interviews conducted with 42 white speakers and 73 black speakers. In total, this corpus spans five US cities and consists of 19.8 h of audio matched on the age and gender of the speaker. We found that all five ASR systems exhibited substantial racial disparities, with an average word error rate (WER) of 0.35 for black speakers compared with 0.19 for white speakers. We trace these disparities to the underlying acoustic models used by the ASR systems as the race gap was equally large on a subset of identical phrases spoken by black and white individuals in our corpus. We conclude by proposing strategies-such as using more diverse training datasets that include African American Vernacular English-to reduce these performance differences and ensure speech recognition technology is inclusive.","['1 Institute for Computational & Mathematical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.', '2 Department of Psychology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.', '3 Department of Linguistics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.', '4 Department of Management Science & Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.', '5 Department of Linguistics, Georgetown University, Washington, DC 20057.', '6 Department of Computer Science, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.', '7 Department of Management Science & Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305; scgoel@stanford.edu.']","Allison Koenecke, Andrew Nam, Emily Lake, Joe Nudell, Minnie Quartey, Zion Mengesha, Connor Toups, John R Rickford, Dan Jurafsky, Sharad Goel, ",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2020,fair machine learning; natural language processing; speech-to-text.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32205437

Using structured data (e.g., demographic variables and vital signs) and different sections of the first SOAP notes as predictors, we developed six NLP-based prediction models (i.e., term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) and truncated singular value decomposition (SVD)) to predict LOS. The metric for model evaluation is the mean squared error (MSE). Results:
      
    

    
      Of the six NLP-based models, the model using structured data and all the sections of the first SOAP notes processed by the TF-IDF and truncated SVD method performed the best, with an MSE of 3.00 [95% CI: 2.94-3.06]. In addition, ten important topics extracted by the TF-IDF and truncated SVD method had significant effects on the LOS (p < 0.001). Conclusion:
      
    

    
      NLP-based models can be used as an early short-term prediction of LOS and have the potential for mixed-type clinical data analysis. The proposed models would likely aid ED physicians' decision-making processes and improve ED quality of care.","['1 Department of Electrical Engineering, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Department of Emergency Medicine, Taichung Veterans General Hospital Chiayi Branch, Chia-Yi, Taiwan.', '2 Department of Electrical Engineering, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', '3 Department of Multimedia and Game Developing Management, Far East University, Tainan, Taiwan.

446,Towards data-driven medical imaging using natural language processing in patients with suspected urolithiasis,"Objective:
      
    

    
      The majority of radiological reports are still written as free text and lack structure. Further evaluation of free-text reports is difficult to achieve without a great deal of manual effort, and is not possible in everyday clinical practice. This study aims to automatically capture clinical information and positive hit rates from narrative radiological reports of suspected urolithiasis using natural language processing (NLP). Methods:
      
    

    
      Narrative reports of low dose computed tomography (CT) of the retroperitoneum from April 2016 to July 2018 (n = 1714) were analyzed using NLP. These free-text reports were automatically structured based on RadLex concepts. Manual feedback was used to test and train the NLP engine to further enhance the performance. The chi-squared test, phi coefficient, and logistic regression analysis were performed to determine the effect of clinical information on the positive hit rate of urolithiasis. Results:
      
    

    
      Urolithiasis was affirmed in 72 % of the reports; in 38 % at least one stone was described in the kidneys, and in 45 % at least one stone was described in the ureter. Clinical information, such as previous stone history and obstructive uropathy, showed a strong correlation with confirmed urolithiasis (p = 0.001). Previous stone history and the combination of obstructive uropathy and loin pain had the highest association with positive urolithiasis (p < 0.001). Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Applying this NLP approach to already existing free-text reports allows the conversion of such reports into a structured form. This may be valuable for epidemiological studies, to evaluate the appropriateness of CT examinations, or to answer a variety of research questions.","['1 Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Germany.

447,Identifying epilepsy psychiatric comorbidities with machine learning,"Objective:
      
    

    
      People with epilepsy are at increased risk for mental health comorbidities. Machine-learning methods based on spoken language can detect suicidality in adults. This study's purpose was to use spoken words to create machine-learning classifiers that identify current or lifetime history of comorbid psychiatric conditions in teenagers and young adults with epilepsy. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      Eligible participants were >12 years old with epilepsy. All participants were interviewed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) or the MINI Kid Tracking and asked five open-ended conversational questions. N-grams and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) word categories were used to construct machine learning classification models from language harvested from interviews. Data were analyzed for four individual MINI identified disorders and for three mutually exclusive groups: participants with no psychiatric disorders, participants with non-suicidal psychiatric disorders, and participants with any degree of suicidality. Performance was measured using areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AROCs). Results:
      
    

    
      Classifiers were constructed from 227 interviews with 122 participants (7.5 ± 3.1 minutes and 454 ± 299 words). AROCs for models differentiating the non-overlapping groups and individual disorders ranged 57%-78% (many with P < .02). Discussion and conclusion:
      
    

    
      Machine-learning classifiers of spoken language can reliably identify current or lifetime history of suicidality and depression in people with epilepsy. Data suggest identification of anxiety and bipolar disorders may be achieved with larger data sets. Machine-learning analysis of spoken language can be promising as a useful screening alternative when traditional approaches are unwieldy (eg, telephone calls, primary care offices, school health clinics).","[""1 Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio."", '2 Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio.']","Tracy Glauser, Daniel Santel, Melissa DelBello, Robert Faist, Tonia Toon, Peggy Clark, Rachel McCourt, Benjamin Wissel, John Pestian, ",Acta neurologica Scandinavica,2020 May,artificial intelligence; childhood absence epilepsy; natural language processing; psychiatric screening.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31889296
448,The Revival of the Notes Field: Leveraging the Unstructured Content in Electronic Health Records,"Problem: Clinical practice requires the production of a time- and resource-consuming great amount of notes. They contain relevant information, but their secondary use is almost impossible, due to their unstructured nature. Researchers are trying to address this problems, with traditional and promising novel techniques. Application in real hospital settings seems not to be possible yet, though, both because of relatively small and dirty dataset, and for the lack of language-specific pre-trained models. Aim: Our aim is to demonstrate the potential of the above techniques, but also raise awareness of the still open challenges that the scientific communities of IT and medical practitioners must jointly address to realize the full potential of unstructured content that is daily produced and digitized in hospital settings, both to improve its data quality and leverage the insights from data-driven predictive models. Methods: To this extent, we present a narrative literature review of the most recent and relevant contributions to leverage the application of Natural Language Processing techniques to the free-text content electronic patient records. In particular, we focused on four selected application domains, namely: data quality, information extraction, sentiment analysis and predictive models, and automated patient cohort selection. Then, we will present a few empirical studies that we undertook at a major teaching hospital specializing in musculoskeletal diseases. Results: We provide the reader with some simple and affordable pipelines, which demonstrate the feasibility of reaching literature performance levels with a single institution non-English dataset. In such a way, we bridged literature and real world needs, performing a step further toward the revival of notes fields.","['1 K-tree SRL, Pont-Saint-Martin, Italy.', '2 University of Milano-Bicocca, Milan, Italy.', '3 Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy.', '4 Link-Up Datareg, Cinisello Balsamo, Italy.', '5 IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Galeazzi, Milan, Italy.']","Michela Assale, Linda Greta Dui, Andrea Cina, Andrea Seveso, Federico Cabitza, ",Frontiers in medicine,2019,clinical intelligence; data quality; information extraction; literature review; machine learning; natural language processing (NLP); sentiment analysis; text mining.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31058150
449,Automating the Capture of Structured Pathology Data for Prostate Cancer Clinical Care and Research,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      Cancer pathology findings are critical for many aspects of care but are often locked away as unstructured free text. Our objective was to develop a natural language processing (NLP) system to extract prostate pathology details from postoperative pathology reports and a parallel structured data entry process for use by urologists during routine documentation care and compare accuracy when compared with manual abstraction and concordance between NLP and clinician-entered approaches. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      From February 2016, clinicians used note templates with custom structured data elements (SDEs) during routine clinical care for men with prostate cancer. We also developed an NLP algorithm to parse radical prostatectomy pathology reports and extract structured data. We compared accuracy of clinician-entered SDEs and NLP-parsed data to manual abstraction as a gold standard and compared concordance (Cohen's κ) between approaches assuming no gold standard. Results:
      
    

    
      There were 523 patients with NLP-extracted data, 319 with SDE data, and 555 with manually abstracted data. For Gleason scores, NLP and clinician SDE accuracy was 95.6% and 95.8%, respectively, compared with manual abstraction, with concordance of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.89 to 0.98). For margin status, extracapsular extension, and seminal vesicle invasion, stage, and lymph node status, NLP accuracy was 94.8% to 100%, SDE accuracy was 87.7% to 100%, and concordance between NLP and SDE ranged from 0.92 to 1.0. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      We show that a real-world deployment of an NLP algorithm to extract pathology data and structured data entry by clinicians during routine clinical care in a busy clinical practice can generate accurate data when compared with manual abstraction for some, but not all, components of a prostate pathology report.","['1 University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.', '2 University of California, San Francisco Medical Center, San Francisco, CA.']","Anobel Y Odisho, Mark Bridge, Mitchell Webb, Niloufar Ameli, Renu S Eapen, Frank Stauf, Janet E Cowan, Samuel L Washington 3rd, Annika Herlemann, Peter R Carroll, Matthew R Cooperberg, ",JCO clinical cancer informatics,2019 Jul,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31314550
450,Characters matter: How narratives shape affective responses to risk communication,"Introduction:
      
    

    
      Whereas scientists depend on the language of probability to relay information about hazards, risk communication may be more effective when embedding scientific information in narratives. The persuasive power of narratives is theorized to reside, in part, in narrative transportation. Purpose:
      
    

    
      This study seeks to advance the science of stories in risk communication by measuring real-time affective responses as a proxy indicator for narrative transportation during science messages that present scientific information in the context of narrative. Methods:
      
    

    
      This study employed a within-subjects design in which participants (n = 90) were exposed to eight science messages regarding flood risk. Conventional science messages using probability and certainty language represented two conditions. The remaining six conditions were narrative science messages that embedded the two conventional science messages within three story forms that manipulated the narrative mechanism of character selection. Informed by the Narrative Policy Framework, the characters portrayed in the narrative science messages were hero, victim, and victim-to-hero. Natural language processing techniques were applied to identify and rank hero and victim vocabularies from 45 resident interviews conducted in the study area; the resulting classified vocabulary was used to build each of the three story types. Affective response data were collected over 12 group sessions across three flood-prone communities in Montana. Dial response technology was used to capture continuous, second-by-second recording of participants' affective responses while listening to each of the eight science messages. Message order was randomized across sessions. ANOVA and three linear mixed-effects models were estimated to test our predictions. Results:
      
    

    
      First, both probabilistic and certainty science language evoked negative affective responses with no statistical differences between them. Second, narrative science messages were associated with greater variance in affective responses than conventional science messages. Third, when characters are in action, variation in the narrative mechanism of character selection leads to significantly different affective responses. Hero and victim-to-hero characters elicit positive affective responses, while victim characters produce a slightly negative response. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      In risk communication, characters matter in audience experience of narrative transportation as measured by affective responses.","['1 Department of Political Science, College of Letters & Science, Montana State University, Bozeman, Montana, United States of America.', '2 Montana Institute on Ecosystems, Montana State University, Bozeman, Montana, United States of America.', '3 Department of Land Resources & Environmental Sciences, College of Agriculture, Montana State University, Bozeman, Montana, United States of America.', '4 Department of Agricultural Economics & Economics, College of Agriculture, Montana State University, Bozeman, Montana, United States of America.', '5 Department of Computer Science, Gianforte School of Computing, Montana State University, Bozeman, Montana, United States of America.', '6 Department of Earth Sciences, College of Letters & Science, Montana State University, Bozeman, Montana, United States of America.']","Elizabeth A Shanahan, Ann Marie Reinhold, Eric D Raile, Geoffrey C Poole, Richard C Ready, Clemente Izurieta, Jamie McEvoy, Nicolas T Bergmann, Henry King, ",PloS one,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31815957
451,Combining entity co-occurrence with specialized word embeddings to measure entity relation in Alzheimer's disease,"Background:
      
    

    
      Extracting useful information from biomedical literature plays an important role in the development of modern medicine. In natural language processing, there have been rigorous attempts to find meaningful relationships between entities automatically by co-occurrence-based methods. It has been increasingly important to understand whether relationships exist, and if so how strong, between any two entities extracted from a large number of texts. One of the defining methods is to measure semantic similarity and relatedness between two entities. Methods:
      
    

    
      We propose a hybrid ranking method that combines a co-occurrence approach considering both direct and indirect entity pair relationship with specialized word embeddings for measuring the relatedness of two entities. Results:
      
    

    
      We evaluate the proposed ranking method comparatively with other well-known methods such as co-occurrence, Word2Vec, COALS (Correlated Occurrence Analog to Lexical Semantics), and random indexing by calculating top-ranked entities related to Alzheimer's disease. In addition, we analyze gene, pathway, and gene-phenotype relationships. Overall, the proposed method tends to find more hidden relationships than the other methods. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Our proposed method is able to select more useful related entities that not only highly co-occur but also have more indirect relations for the target entity. In pathway analysis, our proposed method shows superior performance at identifying (functional) cross clustering and higher-level pathways. Our proposed method, resulting from phenotype analysis, has an advantage in identifying the common genotype relating to phenotypes from biological literature.","['1 Department of Library and Information Science, Yonsei University, 50 Yonsei-ro Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, 03722, Republic of Korea.', '2 Department of Library and Information Science, Yonsei University, 50 Yonsei-ro Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, 03722, Republic of Korea. min.song@yonsei.ac.kr.', '3 Department of Creative IT Engineering, POSTECH, 77 Cheongam-ro Nam-gu, Pohang, Gyeongbuk, 37673, Republic of Korea.']","Go Eun Heo, Qing Xie, Min Song, Jeong-Hoon Lee, ",BMC medical informatics and decision making,2019,Alzheimer’s disease; Information extraction; Knowledge discovery; Ranking algorithm; Semantic relatedness.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31801521

      Physical distancing during the coronavirus Covid-19 pandemic has brought telehealth to the forefront to keep up with patient care amidst an international crisis that is exhausting healthcare resources. Understanding and managing health-related concerns resulting from physical distancing measures are of utmost importance. Objectives:
      
    

    
      To describe and analyze the volume, content, and geospatial distribution of tweets associated with telehealth during the Covid-19 pandemic. Methods:
      
    

    
      We inquired Twitter public data to access tweets related to telehealth from March 30, 2020 to April 6, 2020. We analyzed tweets using natural language processing (NLP) and unsupervised learning methods. Clustering analysis was performed to classify tweets. Geographic tweet distribution was correlated with Covid-19 confirmed cases in the United States. All analyses were carried on the Google Cloud computing service ""Google Colab"" using Python libraries (Python Software Foundation). Results:
      
    

    
      A total of 41,329 tweets containing the term ""telehealth"" were retrieved. The most common terms appearing alongside 'telehealth' were ""covid"", ""health"", ""care"", ""services"", ""patients"", and ""pandemic"". Mental health was the most common health-related topic that appeared in our search reflecting a high need for mental healthcare during the pandemic. Similarly, Medicare was the most common appearing health plan mirroring the accelerated access to telehealth and change in coverage policies. The geographic distribution of tweets related to telehealth and having a specific location within the United States (n=19,367) was significantly associated with the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases reported in each state (p<0.001). Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Social media activity is an accurate reflection of disease burden during the Covid-19 pandemic. Widespread adoption of telehealth-favoring policies is necessary and mostly needed to address mental health problems that may arise in areas of high infection and death rates.","['1 Postgraduate Research, Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA.', '2 Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, LBN.']","Elie Massaad, Patrick Cherfan, ",Cureus,2020,covid-19; data mining; natural language processing; telehealth; twitter.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32467813
453,Precursor-induced conditional random fields: connecting separate entities by induction for improved clinical named entity recognition,"Background:
      
    

    
      This paper presents a conditional random fields (CRF) method that enables the capture of specific high-order label transition factors to improve clinical named entity recognition performance. Consecutive clinical entities in a sentence are usually separated from each other, and the textual descriptions in clinical narrative documents frequently indicate causal or posterior relationships that can be used to facilitate clinical named entity recognition. However, the CRF that is generally used for named entity recognition is a first-order model that constrains label transition dependency of adjoining labels under the Markov assumption. Methods:
      
    

    
      Based on the first-order structure, our proposed model utilizes non-entity tokens between separated entities as an information transmission medium by applying a label induction method. The model is referred to as precursor-induced CRF because its non-entity state memorizes precursor entity information, and the model's structure allows the precursor entity information to propagate forward through the label sequence. Results:
      
    

    
      We compared the proposed model with both first- and second-order CRFs in terms of their F1-scores, using two clinical named entity recognition corpora (the i2b2 2012 challenge and the Seoul National University Hospital electronic health record). The proposed model demonstrated better entity recognition performance than both the first- and second-order CRFs and was also more efficient than the higher-order model. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The proposed precursor-induced CRF which uses non-entity labels as label transition information improves entity recognition F1 score by exploiting long-distance transition factors without exponentially increasing the computational time. In contrast, a conventional second-order CRF model that uses longer distance transition factors showed even worse results than the first-order model and required the longest computation time. Thus, the proposed model could offer a considerable performance improvement over current clinical named entity recognition methods based on the CRF models.","['1 Interdisciplinary Program for Bioengineering, Graduate School, Seoul National University, 103 Daehak-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul, 03080, South Korea.', '2 Interdisciplinary Program for Bioengineering, Graduate School, Seoul National University, 103 Daehak-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul, 03080, South Korea. jinchoi@snu.ac.kr.', '3 Department of Biomedical Engineering, Seoul National University College of Medicine, 103 Daehak-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul, 03080, South Korea. jinchoi@snu.ac.kr.', '4 Institute of Medical and Biological Engineering, Medical Research Center, Seoul National University, 101 Daehak-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul, 03080, South Korea. jinchoi@snu.ac.kr.']","Wangjin Lee, Jinwook Choi, ",BMC medical informatics and decision making,2019,Clinical named entity recognition; Clinical natural language processing; Conditional random fields; High-order dependency; Induction method.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31307440
454,How language shapes prejudice against women: An examination across 45 world languages,"Language provides an ever-present context for our cognitions and has the ability to shape them. Languages across the world can be gendered (language in which the form of noun, verb, or pronoun is presented as female or male) versus genderless. In an ongoing debate, one stream of research suggests that gendered languages are more likely to display gender prejudice than genderless languages. However, another stream of research suggests that language does not have the ability to shape gender prejudice. In this research, we contribute to the debate by using a Natural Language Processing (NLP) method which captures the meaning of a word from the context in which it occurs. Using text data from Wikipedia and the Common Crawl project (that contains text from billions of publicly facing websites) across 45 world languages, covering the majority of the world's population, we test for gender prejudice in gendered and genderless languages. We find that gender prejudice occurs more in gendered rather than genderless languages. Moreover, we examine whether genderedness of language influences the stereotypic dimensions of warmth and competence utilizing the same NLP method.

455,Structured pruning of recurrent neural networks through neuron selection,"Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have recently achieved remarkable successes in a number of applications. However, the huge sizes and computational burden of these models make it difficult for their deployment on edge devices. A practically effective approach is to reduce the overall storage and computation costs of RNNs by network pruning techniques. Despite their successful applications, those pruning methods based on Lasso either produce irregular sparse patterns in weight matrices, which is not helpful in practical speedup. To address these issues, we propose a structured pruning method through neuron selection which can remove the independent neuron of RNNs. More specifically, we introduce two sets of binary random variables, which can be interpreted as gates or switches to the input neurons and the hidden neurons, respectively. We demonstrate that the corresponding optimization problem can be addressed by minimizing the L0 norm of the weight matrix. Finally, experimental results on language modeling and machine reading comprehension tasks have indicated the advantages of the proposed method in comparison with state-of-the-art pruning competitors. In particular, nearly 20× practical speedup during inference was achieved without losing performance for the language model on the Penn TreeBank dataset, indicating the promising performance of the proposed method.","['1 SMILE Lab, School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu 610031, China.', '2 Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin NT 999077, Hong Kong SAR.', '3 SMILE Lab, School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu 610031, China; Center of Artificial Intelligence, Peng Cheng Lab, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China.

457,Publication Landscape Analysis on Gliomas: How Much Has Been Done in the Past 25 Years?,"Introduction: The body of glioma-related literature has grown significantly over the past 25 years. Despite this growth in the amount of published research, gliomas remain one of the most intransigent cancers. The purpose of this study was to analyze the landscape of glioma-related research over the past 25 years using machine learning and text analysis. Methods: In April 2019, we downloaded glioma-related publications indexed in PubMed between 1994 and 2018. We used Python to extract the title, publication date, MeSH terms, and abstract from the metadata of each publication for bibliometric assessment. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) was applied to the abstracts to identify publications' research topics with greater specificity. Results: We identified and analyzed a total of 52,625 publications in our study. We found that research on prognosis and the treatment of glioblastoma increased the most in terms of volume and rate of publications over the past 25 years. However, publications regarding clinical trials accounted for <5% of all publications considered in this study. The current research landscape covers clinical, pre-clinical, biological, and technical aspects of glioblastoma; at present, researchers appear to be less concerned with glioblastoma's psychological effects or patients' end-of-life care. Conclusion: Publication of glioma-related research has expanded rapidly over the past 25 years. Common topics include the disease's molecular background, patients' survival, and treatment outcomes; more research needs to be done on the psychological aspects of glioblastoma and end-of-life care.","['1 Department of Neurosurgery, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.', '2 Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.']","Chenzhe Feng, Yijun Wu, Lu Gao, Xiaopeng Guo, Zihao Wang, Bing Xing, ",Frontiers in oncology,2020,bibliometrics; gliomas; machine learning; natural language processing; publication analysis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32038995

460,The Impact of Field of View on Understanding of a Movie Is Reduced by Magnifying Around the Center of Interest,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      Magnification is commonly used to reduce the impact of impaired central vision. However, magnification limits the field of view (FoV) which may make it difficult to follow the story. Most people with normal vision look in about the same place at about the same time, the center of interest (COI), when watching ""Hollywood"" movies. We hypothesized that if the FoV was centered at the COI, then this view would provide more useful information than either the original image center or an unrelated view location (the COI locations from a different video clip) as the FoV reduced. Methods:
      
    

    
      The FoV was varied between 100% (original) and 3%. To measure video comprehension as the FoV reduced, subjects described 30-second video clips in response to two open-ended questions. A computational, natural-language approach was used to provide an information acquisition (IA) score. Results:
      
    

    
      The IA scores reduced as the FoV decreased. When the FoV was around the COI, subjects were better able to understand the content of the video clips (higher IA scores) as the FoV decreased than the other conditions. Thus, magnification around the COI may serve as a better video enhancement approach than simple magnification of the image center. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      These results have implications for future image processing and scene viewing, which may help people with central vision loss view directed dynamic visual content (""Hollywood"" movies). Translational relevance:
      
    

    
      Our results are promising for the use of magnification around the COI as a vision rehabilitation aid for people with central vision loss.","['1 Schepens Eye Research Institute, Massachusetts Eye and Ear, Boston, MA, USA.', '2 Department of Ophthalmology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']","Francisco M Costela, Russell L Woods, ",Translational vision science & technology,2020,Magnification; center of interest; field of view; movies; zoom.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32855853

Most of the active initiatives are based on the use of standards, each one proposed for a concrete use, without integrating other needs or standards allowing on homogenous use. We propose an alternative to get an unified view of health related data, valid for several uses, that can integrate heterogeneous sources. The proposal set the framework to integrate the developments made so far to automatically learn the extraction and conversion of the data. All the sources are integrated under a single access point. We present the main concepts of EHRagg as a middleware between systems that can incorporate several sources giving an unified access following the FAIR principles.","['1 University of Granada, Granada, Spain.', '2 University of Jaen, Jaen, Spain.', '3 San Cecilio Hospital, Granada, Spain.']","Belen Prados-Suarez, Carlos Molina, Carmen Peña-Yañez, ",Studies in health technology and informatics,2020,Data Mining; Health Data; Interoperability; Natural Language Processing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32570415
462,Optimizing a quantum reservoir computer for time series prediction,"Quantum computing and neural networks show great promise for the future of information processing. In this paper we study a quantum reservoir computer (QRC), a framework harnessing quantum dynamics and designed for fast and efficient solving of temporal machine learning tasks such as speech recognition, time series prediction and natural language processing. Specifically, we study memory capacity and accuracy of a quantum reservoir computer based on the fully connected transverse field Ising model by investigating different forms of inter-spin interactions and computing timescales. We show that variation in inter-spin interactions leads to a better memory capacity in general, by engineering the type of interactions the capacity can be greatly enhanced and there exists an optimal timescale at which the capacity is maximized. To connect computational capabilities to physical properties of the underlaying system, we also study the out-of-time-ordered correlator and find that its faster decay implies a more accurate memory. Furthermore, as an example application on real world data, we use QRC to predict stock values.","['1 Department of Applied Physics and Quantum-Phase Electronics Center (QPEC), The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8656, Japan. aki.kutvonen@gmail.com.', '2 Department of Applied Physics, COMP Center of Excellence, Aalto University School of Science, P.O.

464,Machine learning through cryptographic glasses: combating adversarial attacks by key-based diversified aggregation,"In recent years, classification techniques based on deep neural networks (DNN) were widely used in many fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and self-driving cars. However, the vulnerability of the DNN-based classification systems to adversarial attacks questions their usage in many critical applications. Therefore, the development of robust DNN-based classifiers is a critical point for the future deployment of these methods. Not less important issue is understanding of the mechanisms behind this vulnerability. Additionally, it is not completely clear how to link machine learning with cryptography to create an information advantage of the defender over the attacker. In this paper, we propose a key-based diversified aggregation (KDA) mechanism as a defense strategy in a gray- and black-box scenario. KDA assumes that the attacker (i) knows the architecture of classifier and the used defense strategy, (ii) has an access to the training data set, but (iii) does not know a secret key and does not have access to the internal states of the system. The robustness of the system is achieved by a specially designed key-based randomization. The proposed randomization prevents the gradients' back propagation and restricts the attacker to create a ""bypass"" system. The randomization is performed simultaneously in several channels. Each channel introduces its own randomization in a special transform domain. The sharing of a secret key between the training and test stages creates an information advantage to the defender. Finally, the aggregation of soft outputs from each channel stabilizes the results and increases the reliability of the final score. The performed experimental evaluation demonstrates a high robustness and universality of the KDA against state-of-the-art gradient-based gray-box transferability attacks and the non-gradient-based black-box attacks (The results reported in this paper have been partially presented in CVPR 2019 (Taran et al., Defending against adversarial attacks by randomized diversification, 2019) & ICIP 2019 (Taran et al., Robustification of deep net classifiers by key-based diversified aggregation with pre-filtering, 2019)).","['1 Stochastic Information Processing Group, Department of Computer Science, University of Geneva, 7 Route de Drize, Carouge, GE Switzerland.']","Olga Taran, Shideh Rezaeifar, Taras Holotyak, Slava Voloshynovskiy, ",EURASIP journal on information security,2020,Adversarial examples; Black-box attacks; Defense; Diversified aggregation; Machine learning; Non-gradient/gradient-based attacks; Randomization.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32685910
465,PhenoPro: a novel toolkit for assisting in the diagnosis of Mendelian disease,"Motivation:
      
    

    
      Whole-exome sequencing (WES) is now being used in clinical practice for the diagnosis of the causal genes of Mendelian diseases. In order to make the diagnosis, however, the clinical phenotypes [e.g. Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms] of a patient are needed for prioritizing the variants called from the WES data of the patient. Computational tools are therefore needed to standardize and accelerate this process. Results:
      
    

    
      Here, we introduce a tool named PhenoPro for prioritizing the causal gene of Mendelian disease given both the HPO terms assigned to and the variants called from the WES data of a patient. PhenoPro has been benchmarked using both simulated patients and 287 real diagnosed patients of Chinese ancestry, and shows significant improvements over five previous tools. Moreover, the addition of an internal variant data of Chinese ancestry and the variant data from the patients' parents can further improve PhenoPro's performance. To make PhenoPro a fully automated tool, we also include a natural language processing component for automated HPO term assignment from clinical reports, and demonstrate that the natural language processing is as effective as manual HPO assignment using real clinical reports. In conclusion, PhenoPro can be used as a pre-screening tool to assist in the diagnosis of Mendelian disease genes. Availability and implementation:

466,Hierarchical sequence labeling for extracting BEL statements from biomedical literature,"Background:
      
    

    
      Extracting relations between bio-entities from biomedical literature is often a challenging task and also an essential step towards biomedical knowledge expansion. The BioCreative community has organized a shared task to evaluate the robustness of the causal relationship extraction algorithms in Biological Expression Language (BEL) from biomedical literature. Method:
      
    

    
      We first map the sentence-level BEL statements in the BC-V training corpus to the corresponding text segments, thus generating hierarchically tagged training instances. A hierarchical sequence labeling model was afterwards induced from these training instances and applied to the test sentences in order to construct the BEL statements. Results:
      
    

    
      The experimental results on extracting BEL statements from BioCreative V Track 4 test corpus show that our method achieves promising performance with an overall F-measure of 31.6%. Furthermore, it has the potential to be enhanced by adopting more advanced machine learning approaches. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      We propose a framework for hierarchical relation extraction using hierarchical sequence labeling on the instance-level training corpus derived from the original sentence-level corpus via word alignment. Its main advantage is that we can make full use of the original training corpus to induce the sequence labelers and then apply them to the test corpus.","['1 School of Computer Science and Technology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', '2 School of Computer Science and Technology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China. qianlonghua@suda.edu.cn.']","Suwen Liu, Yifan Shao, Longhua Qian, Guodong Zhou, ",BMC medical informatics and decision making,2019,Biological expression language; Causal relationship extraction; Hierarchical sequence labeling; Word alignment.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30961584
467,Close yet independent: Dissociation of social from valence and abstract semantic dimensions in the left anterior temporal lobe,"The anterior temporal lobe (ATL) is engaged in various types of semantic dimensions. One consistently reported dimension is social information, with abstract words describing social behaviors inducing stronger activations in the ATL than nonsocial words. One potential factor that has been systematically confounded in this finding is emotional valence, given that abstract social words tend to be associated with emotional feelings. We investigated which factors drove the ATL sensitivity using a 2 (social/nonsocial) × 2 (valenced/neutral) factorial design in an fMRI study with relatively high spatial resolutions. We found that sociality and valence were processed in different ATL regions without significant interactions: The social effect was found in the left anterior superior temporal sulcus (aSTS), whereas the valence effect activated small clusters in the bilateral temporal poles (TP). In the left ATL, the social- and valence-related clusters were distinct from another superior ATL area that exhibited a general ""abstractness"" effect with little modulation of sociality or valence. These subregions exhibited distinct whole-brain functional connectivity patterns during the resting state, with the social cluster functionally connected to the default mode network, the valence cluster connected to the adjacent temporal regions and amygdala, and the abstractness cluster connected to a distributed network including a set of language-related regions. These results of activation profiles and connectivity patterns together indicate that the way in which the left ATL supports semantic processing is highly fine-grained, with the neural substrate for social semantic effects dissociated from those for emotional valence and abstractness.","['1 State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning & IDG/McGovern Institute for Brain Research, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China.', '2 Beijing Key Laboratory of Brain Imaging and Connectomics, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China.']","Xiaosha Wang, Bijun Wang, Yanchao Bi, ",Human brain mapping,2019,abstract words; anterior temporal lobe; emotional valence; semantics; sociality.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31379052
468,An Exploratory Study on Pseudo-Data Generation in Prescription and Adverse Drug Reaction Extraction,"Prescription information and adverse drug reactions (ADR) are two components of detailed medication instructions that can benefit many aspects of clinical research. Automatic extraction of this information from free-text narratives via Information Extraction (IE) can open it up to downstream uses. IE is commonly tackled by supervised Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems which rely on annotated training data. However, training data generation is manual, time-consuming, and labor-intensive. It is desirable to develop automatic methods for augmenting manually labeled data. We propose pseudo-data generation as one such automatic method. Pseudo-data are synthetic data generated by combining elements of existing labeled data. We propose and evaluate two sets of pseudo-data generation methods: knowledge-driven methods based on gazetteers and data-driven methods based on deep learning. We use the resulting pseudo-data to improve medication and ADR extraction. Data-driven pseudo-data are suitable for concept categories with high semantic regularities and short textual spans. Knowledge-driven pseudo-data are effective for concept categories with longer textual spans, assuming the knowledge base offers good coverage of these concepts. Combining the knowledge- and data-driven pseudo-data achieves significant performance improvement on medication names and ADRs over baselines limited to the use of available labeled data.","['1 The State University of New York at Albany, Albany, NY, USA.', '2 George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, USA.']","Carson Tao, Kahyun Lee, Michele Filannino, Özlem Uzuner, ",Studies in health technology and informatics,2019,Information Storage and Retrieval; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31437951

However, such information holds potentials for greatly improving the quality of the word representation, as suggested in some recent studies in the general domain. Here we present BioWordVec: an open set of biomedical word vectors/embeddings that combines subword information from unlabeled biomedical text with a widely-used biomedical controlled vocabulary called Medical Subject Headings (MeSH).

Especially as a modern image processing technology, DL has been successfully applied in various tasks, such as object detection, semantic segmentation, and scene analysis. However, with the increase of dense scenes in reality, due to severe occlusions, and small size of objects, the analysis of dense scenes becomes particularly challenging. To overcome these problems, DL recently has been increasingly applied to dense scenes and has begun to be used in dense agricultural scenes. The purpose of this review is to explore the applications of DL for dense scenes analysis in agriculture. In order to better elaborate the topic, we first describe the types of dense scenes in agriculture, as well as the challenges. Next, we introduce various popular deep neural networks used in these dense scenes. Then, the applications of these structures in various agricultural tasks are comprehensively introduced in this review, including recognition and classification, detection, counting and yield estimation.

      This study aimed to present the results of groups participating in a Japanese subtask, English subtask, and Chinese subtask along with discussions, to clarify the issues that need to be resolved in the field of medical NLP. Methods:
      
    

    
      In summary, 8 groups (19 systems) participated in the Japanese subtask, 4 groups (12 systems) participated in the English subtask, and 2 groups (6 systems) participated in the Chinese subtask. In total, 2 baseline systems were constructed for each subtask. The performance of the participant and baseline systems was assessed using the exact match accuracy, F-measure based on precision and recall, and Hamming loss. Results:
      
    

    
      The best system achieved exactly 0.880 match accuracy, 0.920 F-measure, and 0.019 Hamming loss.

473,Identification of pharmacodynamic biomarker hypotheses through literature analysis with IBM Watson,"Background:
      
    

    
      Pharmacodynamic biomarkers are becoming increasingly valuable for assessing drug activity and target modulation in clinical trials. However, identifying quality biomarkers is challenging due to the increasing volume and heterogeneity of relevant data describing the biological networks that underlie disease mechanisms. A biological pathway network typically includes entities (e.g. genes, proteins and chemicals/drugs) as well as the relationships between these and is typically curated or mined from structured databases and textual co-occurrence data. We propose a hybrid Natural Language Processing and directed relationships-based network analysis approach using IBM Watson for Drug Discovery to rank all human genes and identify potential candidate biomarkers, requiring only an initial determination of a specific target-disease relationship. Methods:
      
    

    
      Through natural language processing of scientific literature, Watson for Drug Discovery creates a network of semantic relationships between biological concepts such as genes, drugs, and diseases. Using Bruton's tyrosine kinase as a case study, Watson for Drug Discovery's automatically extracted relationship network was compared with a prominent manually curated physical interaction network. Additionally, potential biomarkers for Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibition were predicted using a matrix factorization approach and subsequently compared with expert-generated biomarkers. Results:
      
    

    
      Watson's natural language processing generated a relationship network matching 55 (86%) genes upstream of BTK and 98 (95%) genes downstream of Bruton's tyrosine kinase in a prominent manually curated physical interaction network. Matrix factorization analysis predicted 11 of 13 genes identified by Merck subject matter experts in the top 20% of Watson for Drug Discovery's 13,595 ranked genes, with 7 in the top 5%. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Taken together, these results suggest that Watson for Drug Discovery's automatic relationship network identifies the majority of upstream and downstream genes in biological pathway networks and can be used to help with the identification and prioritization of pharmacodynamic biomarker evaluation, accelerating the early phases of disease hypothesis generation.","['1 Merck KGaA, Frankfurter Straße, Darmstadt, Germany.', '2 IBM Watson Health, Almaden, California, United States of America.', '3 EMD Serono, Middlesex Turnpike, Billerica, United States of America.', '4 IBM Watson Health, New York, New York, United States of America.', '5 IBM Watson Health, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.']","Sonja Hatz, Scott Spangler, Andrew Bender, Matthew Studham, Philipp Haselmayer, Alix M B Lacoste, Van C Willis, Richard L Martin, Harsha Gurulingappa, Ulrich Betz, ",PloS one,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30958864

There are nuances to the utilization of these analytics tools, which must be well understood by clinicians seeking to take advantage of these innovative research strategies. One must recognize technical challenges to NLP, such as unintended search outcomes and variability in the expression of human written texts. Other caveats include dealing written texts in image formats, which may ultimately be handled with transformation to text format by OCR, though this technology is still under development. IoT is beginning to be used in cardiac monitoring, medication adherence alerts, lifestyle monitoring, and saving traditional labs from equipment failure catastrophes. These technologies will become more prevalent in the future research landscape, and cardiothoracic surgeons should understand the advantages of these technologies to propel our research to the next level. Experience and understanding of technology are needed in building a robust NLP search result, and effective communication with the data management team is a crucial step in successful utilization of these technologies.

475,Assessing Canadians Health Activity and Nutritional Habits Through Social Media,"When conducting data analysis in the twenty-first century, social media is crucial to the analysis due to the ability to provide information on a variety of topics such as health, food, feedback on products, and many others. Presently, users utilize social media to share their daily lifestyles. For example, travel locations, exercises, and food are common subjects of social media posts. By analyzing such information collected from users, health of the general population can be gauged. This analysis can become an integral part of federal efforts to study the health of a nation's people on a large scale. In this paper, we focus on such efforts from a Canadian lens. Public health is becoming a primary concern for many governments around the world. It is believed that it is necessary to analyze the current scenario within a given population before creating any new policies. Traditionally, governments use a variety of ways to gauge the flavor for any new policy including door to door surveys, a national level census, or hospital information to decide health policies. This information is limited and sometimes takes a long time to collect and analyze sufficiently enough to aid in decision making. In this paper, our approach is to solve such problems through the advancement of natural language processing algorithms and large scale data analysis. Our in-depth results show that the proposed method provides a viable solution in less time with the same accuracy when compared to traditional methods.","['1 Department of Computer Science, Lakehead University, Thunder Bay, ON, Canada.', '2 Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Brandon University, Brandon, MB, Canada.', '3 Research Center for Interneural Computing, China Medical University, Taiwan, China.', '4 Northern Ontario School of Medicine, Thunder Bay, ON, Canada.']","Neel Shah, Gautam Srivastava, David W Savage, Vijay Mago, ",Frontiers in public health,2020,calories and physical activity; data analysis; health analysis; machine learning; natural language processing; social media analysis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31993412

      Data, particularly 'big' data are increasingly being used for research in health. Using data from electronic medical records optimally requires coded data, but not all systems produce coded data. Objective:
      
    

    
      To design a suitable, accurate method for converting large volumes of narrative diagnoses from Australian general practice records to codify them into SNOMED-CT-AU. Such codification will make them clinically useful for aggregation for population health and research purposes. Method:
      
    

    
      The developed method consisted of using natural language processing to automatically code the texts, followed by a manual process to correct codes and subsequent natural language processing re-computation. These steps were repeated for four iterations until 95% of the records were coded. The coded data were then aggregated into classes considered to be useful for population health analytics. Results:
      
    

    
      Coding the data effectively covered 95% of the corpus. Problems with the use of SNOMED CT-AU were identified and protocols for creating consistent coding were created.

477,Quantifying risk factors in medical reports with a context-aware linear model,"Objective:
      
    

    
      We seek to quantify the mortality risk associated with mentions of medical concepts in textual electronic health records (EHRs). Recognizing mentions of named entities of relevant types (eg, conditions, symptoms, laboratory tests or behaviors) in text is a well-researched task. However, determining the level of risk associated with them is partly dependent on the textual context in which they appear, which may describe severity, temporal aspects, quantity, etc. Methods:
      
    

    
      To take into account that a given word appearing in the context of different risk factors (medical concepts) can make different contributions toward risk level, we propose a multitask approach, called context-aware linear modeling, which can be applied using appropriately regularized linear regression. To improve the performance for risk factors unseen in training data (eg, rare diseases), we take into account their distributional similarity to other concepts. Results:
      
    

    
      The evaluation is based on a corpus of 531 reports from EHRs with 99 376 risk factors rated manually by experts. While context-aware linear modeling significantly outperforms single-task models, taking into account concept similarity further improves performance, reaching the level of human annotators' agreements. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Our results show that automatic quantification of risk factors in EHRs can achieve performance comparable to human assessment, and taking into account the multitask structure of the problem and the ability to handle rare concepts is crucial for its accuracy.","['1 National Centre for Text Mining, School of Computer Science, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.']","Piotr Przybyła, Austin J Brockmeier, Sophia Ananiadou, ",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2019,electronic health records; machine learning; multitask learning; natural language processing; risk assessment.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30840055
478,A web-based support system for biometeorological research,"Data are the fundamental building blocks to conduct scientific studies that seek to understand natural phenomena in space and time. The notion of data processing is ubiquitous and nearly operates in any project that requires gaining insight from the data. The increasing availability of information sources, data formats and download services offered to the users, makes it difficult to reuse or exploit the potential of those new resources in multiple scientific fields. In this paper, we present a spatial extract-transform-load (spatial-ETL) approach for downloading atmospheric datasets in order to produce new biometeorological indices and expose them publicly for reuse in research studies. The technologies and processes involved in our work are clearly defined in a context where the GDAL library and the Python programming language are key elements for the development and implementation of the geoprocessing tools. Since the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is the source of information, the ETL process is executed each time this service publishes an updated atmospheric prediction model, thus obtaining different forecasts for spatial and temporal analyses. As a result, we present a web application intended for downloading these newly created datasets after processing, and visualising interactive web maps with the outcomes resulting from a number of geoprocessing tasks. We also elaborate on all functions and technologies used for the design of those processes, with emphasis on the optimisation of the resources as implemented in cloud services.","['1 Science and Technology Department, Valencian International University, Valencia, Spain. barroquia@universidadviu.com.', '2 Department of Cartographic Engineering, Geodesy and Photogrammetry, Universitat Politècnica de València, Valencia, Spain.', '3 Valencian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Universitat Politècnica de València, Valencia, Spain.', '4 Department of Geography, University of Cantabria, Cantabria, Spain.']","Benjamín Arroquia-Cuadros, Ángel Marqués-Mateu, Laura Sebastia, Pablo Fdez-Arroyabe, ",International journal of biometeorology,2020,Biometeorology; Data science; ETL; Geomatics; Geoprocessing; Web mapping.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32789557
479,What do patients learn about psychotropic medications on the web? A natural language processing study,"Background:
      
    

    
      Low rates of medication adherence remain a major challenge across psychiatry. In part, this likely reflects patient concerns about safety and adverse effects, accurate or otherwise. We therefore sought to characterize online information about common psychiatric medications in terms of positive and negative sentiment. Methods:
      
    

    
      We applied a natural language processing tool to score the sentiment expressed in web search results for 51 psychotropic medications across 3 drug classes (antidepressants, antipsychotics, and mood stabilizers), as a means of seeing if articles referencing these medications were generally positive or generally negative in tone. We compared between medications of the same class, and across medication classes. Results:
      
    

    
      Across 12,733 web search results, significant within-class differences in positive (antidepressants: F(24,2682) = 2.97, p < 0.001; antipsychotics: F(16,4029) = 3.25, p < 0.001; mood stabilizers: F(8,2371) = 6.88, p < 0.001) and negative sentiment (antidepressants: F(24,6282) = 11.17, p < 0.001; antipsychotics: F(16, 4029) = 12.13, p < 0.001; mood stabilizers: F(8, 2371) = 13.28, p < 0.001) were identified. Among these were significantly greater negative sentiment for the antidepressants sertraline, duloxetine, venlafaxine, and paroxetine, and for the antipsychotics, quetiapine and risperidone. Conversely, lithium preparations and valproate exhibited less negative sentiment than other mood stabilizing medications. Limitations:
      
    

    
      While these results provide a novel means of comparing medications, the present analyses cannot be linked to individual patient consumption of this information, or to its influence on their future clinical interactions. Conclusions:

480,"MADEx: A System for Detecting Medications, Adverse Drug Events, and Their Relations from Clinical Notes","Introduction:
      
    

    
      Early detection of adverse drug events (ADEs) from electronic health records is an important, challenging task to support pharmacovigilance and drug safety surveillance. A well-known challenge to use clinical text for detection of ADEs is that much of the detailed information is documented in a narrative manner. Clinical natural language processing (NLP) is the key technology to extract information from unstructured clinical text. Objective:
      
    

    
      We present a machine learning-based clinical NLP system-MADEx-for detecting medications, ADEs, and their relations from clinical notes. Methods:
      
    

    
      We developed a recurrent neural network (RNN) model using a long short-term memory (LSTM) strategy for clinical name entity recognition (NER) and compared it with baseline conditional random fields (CRFs). We also developed a modified training strategy for the RNN, which outperformed the widely used early stop strategy. For relation extraction, we compared support vector machines (SVMs) and random forests on single-sentence relations and cross-sentence relations. In addition, we developed an integrated pipeline to extract entities and relations together by combining RNNs and SVMs. Results:
      
    

    
      MADEx achieved the top-three best performances (F1 score of 0.8233) for clinical NER in the 2018 Medication and Adverse Drug Events (MADE1.0) challenge. The post-challenge evaluation showed that the relation extraction module and integrated pipeline (identify entity and relation together) of MADEx are comparable with the best systems developed in this challenge. Conclusion:

481,Efficient goal attainment and engagement in a care manager system using unstructured notes,"Objective:
      
    

    
      To improve efficient goal attainment of patients by analyzing the unstructured text in care manager (CM) notes (CMNs). Our task is to determine whether the goal assigned by the CM can be achieved in a timely manner. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      Our data consists of CM structured and unstructured records from a private firm in Orlando, FL. The CM data is based on phone interactions between the CM and the patient. A portion of the data has been manually annotated to indicate engagement. We present 2 machine learning classifiers: an engagement model and a goal attainment model. Results:
      
    

    
      We can successfully distinguish automatically between engagement and lack of engagement. Subsequently, incorporating engagement and features from textual information from the unstructured notes significantly improves goal attainment classification. Discussion:
      
    

    
      Two key challenges in this task were the time-consuming annotation effort for engagement classification and the limited amount of data for the more difficult goal attainment class (specifically, for people who take a long time to achieve their goals). We successfully explore domain adaptation and transfer learning techniques to improve performance on the under-represented classes. We also explore the value of using features from unstructured notes to improve the model and interpretability. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Unstructured CMNs can be used to improve accuracy of our classification models for predicting patient self-management goal attainment. This work can be used to help identify patients who may require special attention from CMs to improve engagement in self-management.","['1 IBM Research, Yorktown Heights, New York, USA.', '2 MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, IBM Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.']","Sara Rosenthal, Subhro Das, Pei-Yun Sabrina Hsueh, Ken Barker, Ching-Hua Chen, ",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2020,evidence-based healthcare management; natural language processing; patient engagement; supervised machine learning.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32142137
482,Talker change detection: A comparison of human and machine performance,"The automatic analysis of conversational audio remains difficult, in part, due to the presence of multiple talkers speaking in turns, often with significant intonation variations and overlapping speech. The majority of prior work on psychoacoustic speech analysis and system design has focused on single-talker speech or multi-talker speech with overlapping talkers (for example, the cocktail party effect). There has been much less focus on how listeners detect a change in talker or in probing the acoustic features significant in characterizing a talker's voice in conversational speech. This study examines human talker change detection (TCD) in multi-party speech utterances using a behavioral paradigm in which listeners indicate the moment of perceived talker change. Human reaction times in this task can be well-estimated by a model of the acoustic feature distance among speech segments before and after a change in talker, with estimation improving for models incorporating longer durations of speech prior to a talker change. Further, human performance is superior to several online and offline state-of-the-art machine TCD systems.","['1 Department of Psychology, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213, USA.', '2 Department of Electrical Engineering, CV Raman Road, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore 560012, India.']","Neeraj Kumar Sharma, Shobhana Ganesh, Sriram Ganapathy, Lori L Holt, ",The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America,2019 Jan,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30710945
483,Combining relation extraction with function detection for BEL statement extraction,"The BioCreative-V community proposed a challenging task of automatic extraction of causal relation network in Biological Expression Language (BEL) from the biomedical literature. Previous studies on this task largely used models induced from other related tasks and then transformed intermediate structures to BEL statements, which left the given training corpus unexplored. To make full use of the BEL training corpus, in this work, we propose a deep learning-based approach to extract BEL statements. Specifically, we decompose the problem into two subtasks: entity relation extraction and entity function detection. First, two attention-based bidirectional long short-term memory networks models are used to extract entity relation and entity function, respectively. Then entity relation and their functions are combined into a BEL statement. In order to boost the overall performance, a strategy of threshold filtering is applied to improve the precision of identified entity functions. We evaluate our approach on the BioCreative-V Track 4 corpus with or without gold entities. The experimental results show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance with an overall F1-measure of 46.9% in stage 2 and 21.3% in stage 1, respectively.","['1 School of Computer Science and Technology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.']","Suwen Liu, Wei Cheng, Longhua Qian, Guodong Zhou, ",Database : the journal of biological databases and curation,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30624649
484,Towards a characterization of apparent contradictions in the biomedical literature using context analysis,"Background:
      
    

    
      With the substantial growth in the biomedical research literature, a larger number of claims are published daily, some of which seemingly disagree with or contradict prior claims on the same topics. Resolving such contradictions is critical to advancing our understanding of human disease and developing effective treatments. Automated text analysis techniques can facilitate such analysis by extracting claims from the literature, flagging those that are potentially contradictory, and identifying any study characteristics that may explain such contradictions. Methods:
      
    

    
      Using SemMedDB, our own PubMed-scale repository of semantic predications (subject-relation-object triples), we identified apparent contradictions in the biomedical research literature and developed a categorization of contextual characteristics that explain such contradictions. Clinically relevant semantic predications relating to 20 diseases and involving opposing predicate pairs (e.g., an intervention treats or causes a disease) were retrieved from SemMedDB. After addressing inference, uncertainty, generic concepts, and NLP errors through automatic and manual filtering steps, a set of apparent contradictions were identified and characterized. Results:
      
    

    
      We retrieved 117,676 predication instances from 62,360 PubMed abstracts (Jan 1980-Dec 2016). From these instances, automatic filtering steps generated 2236 candidate contradictory pairs. Through manual analysis, we determined that 58 of these pairs (2.6%) were apparent contradictions. We identified five main categories of contextual characteristics that explain these contradictions: (a) internal to the patient, (b) external to the patient, (c) endogenous/exogenous, (d) known controversy, and (e) contradictions in literature. Categories (a) and (b) were subcategorized further (e.g., species, dosage) and accounted for the bulk of the contradictory information. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Semantic predications, by accounting for lexical variability, and SemMedDB, owing to its literature scale, can support identification and elucidation of potentially contradictory claims across the biomedical domain. Further filtering and classification steps are needed to distinguish among them the true contradictory claims. The ability to detect contradictions automatically can facilitate important biomedical knowledge management tasks, such as tracking and verifying scientific claims, summarizing research on a given topic, identifying knowledge gaps, and assessing evidence for systematic reviews, with potential benefits to the scientific community. Future work will focus on automating these steps for fully automatic recognition of contradictions from the biomedical research literature.","['1 National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, 8600 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20894, USA.

Specifically, two strategies were proposed for feature engineering: (1) domain knowledge features and (2) unsupervised word representation features of clustered and binarized word embeddings. Our best system achieved an F-measure of 91.79% for recognizing software from titles and an F-measure of 86.35% for recognizing software from both titles and abstracts using inexact matching criteria. We then created a biomedical software catalog with 19,557 entries using the developed system.

A majority of clinical NLP systems adopt dictionary or lexicon based approaches and the performance of concept encoding is often evaluated using a human created gold standard generated with reference to the most up-to-date standard terminologies available at the time of gold standard creation. With the advance of medical science, standard terminologies or dictionaries can evolve. However, it remains unknown whether the dictionary updates will impact the performance of concept encoding. In this study, we evaluated the annotation performance of two clinical NLP systems, cTAKES and MedXN based on updated dictionaries to gain further insights. Specifically, we compared the automatic annotation results with previously manually generated gold standards. The results of our study demonstrate the annotation changes based on dictionary updates in clinical NLP systems and that it is necessary to do temporal management for gold standards, which raises the need for appropriate terminology management tools for back version compatibility to update gold standards.","['1 Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN, United States.', '2 Institute for Health Informatics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, United States.']","Yadan Fan, Andrew Wen, Feichen Shen, Sunghwan Sohn, Hongfang Liu, Liwei Wang, ",AMIA Joint Summits on Translational Science proceedings.

488,Driving pressure is not associated with mortality in mechanically ventilated patients without ARDS,"Background:
      
    

    
      In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), low tidal volume ventilation has been associated with reduced mortality. Driving pressure (tidal volume normalized to respiratory system compliance) may be an even stronger predictor of ARDS survival than tidal volume. We sought to study whether these associations hold true in acute respiratory failure patients without ARDS. Methods:
      
    

    
      This is a retrospectively cohort analysis of mechanically ventilated adult patients admitted to ICUs from 12 hospitals over 2 years. We used natural language processing of chest radiograph reports and data from the electronic medical record to identify patients who had ARDS. We used multivariable logistic regression and generalized linear models to estimate associations between tidal volume, driving pressure, and respiratory system compliance with adjusted 30-day mortality using covariates of Acute Physiology Score (APS), Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), age, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio. Results:
      
    

    
      We studied 2641 patients; 48% had ARDS (n = 1273). Patients with ARDS had higher mean APS (25 vs. 23, p < .001) but similar CCI (4 vs. 3, p = 0.6) scores. For non-ARDS patients, tidal volume was associated with increased adjusted mortality (OR 1.18 per 1 mL/kg PBW increase in tidal volume, CI 1.04 to 1.35, p = 0.010). We observed no association between driving pressure or respiratory compliance and mortality in patients without ARDS.

With these ideas in mind, I offer a model of morphological processing that incorporates semantic and morpho-syntactic operations in service to meaning composition, and discuss how such a model could be implemented in the human brain.

490,Identifying indigenous practices for cultivation of wild saprophytic mushrooms: responding to the need for sustainable utilization of natural resources,"Background:
      
    

    
      Due to increasing pressure on natural resources, subsistence agriculture communities in Uganda and Sub-Saharan Africa are experiencing increasingly restricted access to diminishing natural resources that are a critical requirement of their livelihoods. Previously, common-pool resources like forests and grasslands have been either gazetted for conservation or leased for agriculture, the latter in particular for large-scale sugarcane production. Satisfying the increasing consumer demand for grassland or forestry products like wild mushrooms as food or medicine, requires innovative ethno-biological and industry development strategies to improve production capacity, while easing the pressure on diminishing natural resources and averting ecosystems degradation. Methods:
      
    

    
      This case study addresses traditional knowledge systems for artisanal mycoculture to identify cultivation practices that enhance sustainable utilization of natural resources. Multi-scalar stakeholder engagement across government and community sectors identified artisanal mushroom producers across five districts in Uganda. Focus groups and semi-structured interviews characterized artisanal production methods and identified locally used substrates for cultivation of different mushroom species. Results:
      
    

    
      Artisanal practices were characterized for the cultivation of six wild saprophytic mushroom species including Volvariella speciosa (akasukusuku), two Termitomyces sp. (obunegyere and another locally unnamed species), Agaricus sp. (ensyabire) and Agrocybe sp. (emponzira), and one exotic Pleurotus sp. (oyster) that are used as food or medicine. The substrates used for each species differed according to the mushroom's mode of decomposition, those being the following: tertiary decomposers such as those growing under rotting tree stumps or logs from forestry activity like the Agrocybe sp. known as emponzira which grows in forests, thickets, or near homesteads where big logs of hardwood have been left to rot. Also pieces of firewood are chipped off whenever need arises thus providing fuel; secondary decomposers growing on naturally composted grass associated with termites like the Termitomyces sp. known as obunegyere growing in protected sites in gardens, composted cattle manure for Agaricus sp. known as ensyabire in the kraal area where cattle manure is plenty, composted maize cobs for a locally unnamed Agaricus sp. on heaped cobs placed near homesteads; and primary decomposers growing on waste sorghum from brewing the traditional alcoholic drink, muramba for Pleurotus sp. (oyster), and banana and spear grass residue from banana juice processing like the Volvariella speciosa known as akasukusuku because it is associated with the banana plantation locally known in the Luganda language as olusuku and is usually heaped under ficus trees. Management practices also varied based on mode of decomposition and other ecological requirements such as the following: zero tillage and minimal disturbance in areas where obunegyere grow, heaping banana and spear grass residues under the cool ficus trees which also keep them away from banana stump that may cause infestation with nematodes and insects. Even within the generic practices accessibility by the users is critical for example placing logs near homes where children can use them to play, they can be used as fire wood and to even get off-season mushroom as household waste water can make the mushrooms grow. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our description of artisanal mycoculture methods that respond to conservation and utilization pressures, demonstrates the value of addressing traditional knowledge to improve ethno-biology and mycoculture industry practice. Traditional communities engage in multiple technological and organizational innovations and practices for sustainability and in the case of mushroom production to conserve the environment and culture, ensure variety, food and nutrition security, and income. The results of this study present opportunities to preserve ecosystem quality while developing an artisanal mycoculture system. They have also identified aspects of artisanal mycoculture that most urgently require further ethno-biological study and industry development. Future research and industry development can utilize the result of this study to boost artisanal production of wild saprophytic mushrooms in Sub-Saharan countries, for food or medicinal consumption, and environment conservation. Further development of production efficiencies in context with sustainable natural resource management is recommended.","['1 Centre for Industrial Microbiology and Bioprocess Engineering, Department of Product Development, Uganda Industrial Research Institute, P.

491,Predicting life expectancy with a long short-term memory recurrent neural network using electronic medical records,"Background:
      
    

    
      Life expectancy is one of the most important factors in end-of-life decision making. Good prognostication for example helps to determine the course of treatment and helps to anticipate the procurement of health care services and facilities, or more broadly: facilitates Advance Care Planning. Advance Care Planning improves the quality of the final phase of life by stimulating doctors to explore the preferences for end-of-life care with their patients, and people close to the patients. Physicians, however, tend to overestimate life expectancy, and miss the window of opportunity to initiate Advance Care Planning. This research tests the potential of using machine learning and natural language processing techniques for predicting life expectancy from electronic medical records. Methods:
      
    

    
      We approached the task of predicting life expectancy as a supervised machine learning task. We trained and tested a long short-term memory recurrent neural network on the medical records of deceased patients. We developed the model with a ten-fold cross-validation procedure, and evaluated its performance on a held-out set of test data. We compared the performance of a model which does not use text features (baseline model) to the performance of a model which uses features extracted from the free texts of the medical records (keyword model), and to doctors' performance on a similar task as described in scientific literature. Results:
      
    

    
      Both doctors and the baseline model were correct in 20% of the cases, taking a margin of 33% around the actual life expectancy as the target. The keyword model, in comparison, attained an accuracy of 29% with its prognoses. While doctors overestimated life expectancy in 63% of the incorrect prognoses, which harms anticipation to appropriate end-of-life care, the keyword model overestimated life expectancy in only 31% of the incorrect prognoses. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Prognostication of life expectancy is difficult for humans. Our research shows that machine learning and natural language processing techniques offer a feasible and promising approach to predicting life expectancy. The research has potential for real-life applications, such as supporting timely recognition of the right moment to start Advance Care Planning.","['1 Centre for Language Studies, Radboud University, Erasmusplein 1, 6525, HT, Nijmegen, The Netherlands. m.t.beeksma@let.ru.nl.', '2 Leiden Institute for Advanced Computer Sciences, Leiden University, Niels Bohrweg 1, 2333, CA, Leiden, The Netherlands.', '3 KNAW Meertens Institute, Oudezijds Achterburgwal 185, 1012, DK, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', '4 Centre for Language Studies, Radboud University, Erasmusplein 1, 6525, HT, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', '5 IQ Healthcare, Radboudumc, Mailbox 9101, 6500, HB, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']","Merijn Beeksma, Suzan Verberne, Antal van den Bosch, Enny Das, Iris Hendrickx, Stef Groenewoud, ",BMC medical informatics and decision making,2019,Advance care planning; Clinical free-text; Life expectancy prediction; Long short-term memory.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30819172

      Evidence-based women's healthcare is underpinned by systematic reviews and guidelines. Generating an evidence synthesis to support guidance for clinical practice is a time-consuming and labour-intensive activity that delays transfer of research into practice. Artificial intelligence has the potential to rapidly collate, combine, and update high-quality medical evidence with accuracy and precision, and without bias. Recent findings:
      
    

    
      This article describes the main fields of artificial intelligence with examples of its application to systematic reviews. These include the capabilities of processing natural language texts, retrieving information, reasoning, and learning. The complementarity and interconnection of the various artificial intelligence techniques can be harnessed to solve difficult problems in automation of reviews. Computer science can advance evidence-based medicine through development, testing, and refinement of artificial intelligence tools to deploy automation, creating 'living' evidence syntheses.

493,The human brain processes hierarchical structures of meter and harmony differently: Evidence from musicians and nonmusicians,"The processing of temporal structure has been widely investigated, but evidence on how the brain processes temporal and nontemporal structures simultaneously is sparse. Using event-related potentials (ERPs), we examined how the brain responds to temporal (metric) and nontemporal (harmonic) structures in music simultaneously, and whether these processes are impacted by musical expertise. Fifteen musicians and 15 nonmusicians rated the degree of completeness of musical sequences with or without violations in metric or harmonic structures. In the single violation conditions, the ERP results showed that both musicians and nonmusicians exhibited an early right anterior negativity (ERAN) as well as an N5 to temporal violations (""when""), and only an N5-like response to nontemporal violations (""what""), which were consistent with the behavioral results. In the double violation condition, however, only the ERP results, but not the behavioral results, revealed a significant interaction between temporal and nontemporal violations at a later integrative stage, as manifested by an enlarged N5 effect compared to the single violation conditions. These findings provide the first evidence that the human brain uses different neural mechanisms in processing metric and harmonic structures in music, which may shed light on how the brain generates predictions for ""what"" and ""when"" events in the natural environment.","['1 Department of Psychology, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai, China.', '2 Department of Psychology, Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', '3 School of Psychology and Clinical Language Sciences, University of Reading, Reading, UK.', '4 Music College, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai, China.', '5 Institute of Psychology, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai, China.']","Lijun Sun, William Forde Thompson, Fang Liu, Linshu Zhou, Cunmei Jiang, ",Psychophysiology,2020 Sep,ERPs; harmonic structure; metric structure; musical expertise; what and when information.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32449180
494,Recommendation system in social networks with topical attention and probabilistic matrix factorization,"Collaborative filtering (CF) is a common recommendation mechanism that relies on user-item ratings. However, the intrinsic sparsity of user-item rating data can be problematic in many domains and settings, limiting the ability to generate accurate predictions and effective recommendations. At present, most algorithms use two-valued trust relationship of social network to improve recommendation quality but fail to take into account the difference of trust intensity of each friend and user's comment information. To this end, the recommendation system within a social network adopts topical attention and probabilistic matrix factorization (STAPMF) is proposed. We combine the trust information in social networks and the topical information from review documents by proposing a novel algorithm combining probabilistic matrix factorization and attention-based recurrent neural networks to extract item underlying feature vectors, user's personal potential feature vectors, and user's social hidden feature vectors, which represent the features extracted from the user's trusted network. Using real-world datasets, we show a significant improvement in recommendation performance comparing with the prevailing state-of-the-art algorithms for social network-based recommendation.","['1 School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong Normal University, Jinan, China.']","Weiwei Zhang, Fangai Liu, Daomeng Xu, Lu Jiang, ",PloS one,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31671119
495,Classifying Promoters by Interpreting the Hidden Information of DNA Sequences via Deep Learning and Combination of Continuous FastText N-Grams,"A promoter is a short region of DNA (100-1,000 bp) where transcription of a gene by RNA polymerase begins. It is typically located directly upstream or at the 5' end of the transcription initiation site. DNA promoter has been proven to be the primary cause of many human diseases, especially diabetes, cancer, or Huntington's disease. Therefore, classifying promoters has become an interesting problem and it has attracted the attention of a lot of researchers in the bioinformatics field. There were a variety of studies conducted to resolve this problem, however, their performance results still require further improvement. In this study, we will present an innovative approach by interpreting DNA sequences as a combination of continuous FastText N-grams, which are then fed into a deep neural network in order to classify them. Our approach is able to attain a cross-validation accuracy of 85.41 and 73.1% in the two layers, respectively. Our results outperformed the state-of-the-art methods on the same dataset, especially in the second layer (strength classification). Throughout this study, promoter regions could be identified with high accuracy and it provides analysis for further biological research as well as precision medicine.

497,deepBioWSD: effective deep neural word sense disambiguation of biomedical text data,"Objective:
      
    

    
      In biomedicine, there is a wealth of information hidden in unstructured narratives such as research articles and clinical reports. To exploit these data properly, a word sense disambiguation (WSD) algorithm prevents downstream difficulties in the natural language processing applications pipeline. Supervised WSD algorithms largely outperform un- or semisupervised and knowledge-based methods; however, they train 1 separate classifier for each ambiguous term, necessitating a large number of expert-labeled training data, an unattainable goal in medical informatics. To alleviate this need, a single model that shares statistical strength across all instances and scales well with the vocabulary size is desirable. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      Built on recent advances in deep learning, our deepBioWSD model leverages 1 single bidirectional long short-term memory network that makes sense prediction for any ambiguous term. In the model, first, the Unified Medical Language System sense embeddings will be computed using their text definitions; and then, after initializing the network with these embeddings, it will be trained on all (available) training data collectively. This method also considers a novel technique for automatic collection of training data from PubMed to (pre)train the network in an unsupervised manner. Results:
      
    

    
      We use the MSH WSD dataset to compare WSD algorithms, with macro and micro accuracies employed as evaluation metrics. deepBioWSD outperforms existing models in biomedical text WSD by achieving the state-of-the-art performance of 96.82% for macro accuracy. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Apart from the disambiguation improvement and unsupervised training, deepBioWSD depends on considerably less number of expert-labeled data as it learns the target and the context terms jointly. These merit deepBioWSD to be conveniently deployable in real-time biomedical applications.","['1 Faculty of Computer Science, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada.', '2 Institute for Big Data Analytics, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada.', '3 School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.', '4 School of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Ottawa, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON K1G 5Z3, Canada.']","Ahmad Pesaranghader, Stan Matwin, Marina Sokolova, Ali Pesaranghader, ",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2019,bidirectional long short-term memory network; biomedical text mining; deep neural networks; word sense disambiguation; zero-shot learning.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30811548
498,Differential brain mechanisms during reading human vs. machine translated fiction and news texts,"Few neuroimaigng studies on reading comprehension have been conducted under natural reading settings. In this study, we showed texts presented in a natural way during functional MRI (fMRI) measurements to reveal brain areas sensitive to reading comprehension. Specifically, this paradigm independently manipulated two holistic features of article style: text genre and translation style, a qualitative index of how typical word choices and arrangements are made in daily use of the language. Specifically, articles from The New York Times (news) and Reader's Digest (fiction) translated from English to Mandarin Chinese either by human experts or machine (Google Translate) were used to investigate the correlation of brain activity across participants during article reading. We found that bi-hemispheric visual cortex, precuneus, and occipito-parietal junction show significantly correlated hemodynamics across participants regardless of translation style and article genre. Compared to machine translation, reading human expert translation elicited more reliable fMRI signals across participants at precuneus, potentially because narrative representations and contents can be coherently presented over tens of seconds. We also found significantly stronger inter-subject correlated fMRI signals at temporal poles and fusiform gyri in fiction reading than in news reading. This may be attributed to more stable empathy processing across participants in fiction reading. The degree of stability of brain responses across subjects at extra-linguistic areas was found correlated with subjective rating on the text fluency. The functional connectivity between these areas was modulated by text genre and translation style. Taken together, our imaging results suggested stable and selective neural substrates associated with comprehending holistic features of written narratives.","['1 Institute of Biomedical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', '2 Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', '3 Department of Neuroscience and Biomedical Engineering, Aalto University, Espoo, Finland.', '4 Institute of Neuroscience, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', '5 Institute of Neuroscience, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan. wjkuo@ym.edu.tw.']","Fa-Hsuan Lin, Yun-Fei Liu, Hsin-Ju Lee, Claire H C Chang, Iiro P Jaaskelainen, Jyh-Neng Yeh, Wen-Jui Kuo, ",Scientific reports,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31519990
499,CeModule: an integrative framework for discovering regulatory patterns from genomic data in cancer,"Background:
      
    

    
      Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are emerging as key regulators and play critical roles in a wide range of tumorigenesis. Recent studies have suggested that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) could interact with microRNAs (miRNAs) and indirectly regulate miRNA targets through competing interactions. Therefore, uncovering the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory mechanism of lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs in post-transcriptional level will aid in deciphering the underlying pathogenesis of human polygenic diseases and may unveil new diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities. However, the functional roles of vast majority of cancer specific ncRNAs and their combinational regulation patterns are still insufficiently understood. Results:
      
    

    
      Here we develop an integrative framework called CeModule to discover lncRNA, miRNA and mRNA-associated regulatory modules. We fully utilize the matched expression profiles of lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs and establish a model based on joint orthogonality non-negative matrix factorization for identifying modules. Meanwhile, we impose the experimentally verified miRNA-lncRNA interactions, the validated miRNA-mRNA interactions and the weighted gene-gene network into this framework to improve the module accuracy through the network-based penalties. The sparse regularizations are also used to help this model obtain modular sparse solutions. Finally, an iterative multiplicative updating algorithm is adopted to solve the optimization problem. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We applied CeModule to two cancer datasets including ovarian cancer (OV) and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC) obtained from TCGA. The modular analysis indicated that the identified modules involving lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs are significantly associated and functionally enriched in cancer-related biological processes and pathways, which may provide new insights into the complex regulatory mechanism of human diseases at the system level.","['1 College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, 410082, China.', '2 Hunan Provincial Key Laboratory of Intelligent Computing and Language Information Processing, Hunan Normal University, Changsha, 410081, China.', '3 College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, 410082, China. luojiawei@hnu.edu.cn.', '4 College of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong Normal University, Jinan, 250000, China.']","Qiu Xiao, Jiawei Luo, Cheng Liang, Jie Cai, Guanghui Li, Buwen Cao, ",BMC bioinformatics,2019,Cancer; Machine learning; Module discovery; Regulatory pattern; ceRNA; lncRNA function; microRNA.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30732558
500,Active Bilingualism in Aging: Balanced Bilingualism Usage and Less Frequent Language Switching Relates to Better Conflict Monitoring and Goal Maintenance Ability,"Objectives:
      
    

    
      Experience-related neuroplasticity suggests that bilinguals who actively manage their two languages would develop more efficient neural organization at brain regions related to language control, which also overlap with areas involved in executive control. Our aim was to examine how active bilingualism-manifested as the regular balanced use of two languages and language switching-may be related to the different domains of executive control in highly proficient healthy older adult bilinguals, controlling for age, processing speed, and fluid intelligence. Methods:
      
    

    
      Participants were 76 community-dwelling older adults who reported being physically and mentally healthy and showed no signs of cognitive impairment. They completed a self-report questionnaire on their language background, two computer measures for previously identified covariates (processing speed as measured by two-choice reaction time (RT) task and fluid intelligence as measured by the Raven's Progressive Matrices), as well as a battery of computerized executive control tasks (Color-shape Task Switching, Stroop, Flanker, and Spatial 2-back task). Results:
      
    

    
      Regression analyses showed that, even after controlling for age, processing speed, and fluid intelligence, more balanced bilingualism usage and less frequent language switching predicted higher goal maintenance (non-switch trials RT in Color-shape Task Switching) and conflict monitoring abilities (global RT in Color-shape Task Switching and Flanker task).

      Consumers increasingly turn to the internet in search of health-related information; and they want their questions answered with short and precise passages, rather than needing to analyze lists of relevant documents returned by search engines and reading each document to find an answer. We aim to answer consumer health questions with information from reliable sources. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      We combine knowledge-based, traditional machine and deep learning approaches to understand consumers' questions and select the best answers from consumer-oriented sources. We evaluate the end-to-end system and its components on simple questions generated in a pilot development of MedlinePlus Alexa skill, as well as the short and long real-life questions submitted to the National Library of Medicine by consumers. Results:
      
    

    
      Our system achieves 78.7% mean average precision and 87.9% mean reciprocal rank on simple Alexa questions, and 44.5% mean average precision and 51.6% mean reciprocal rank on real-life questions submitted by National Library of Medicine consumers. Discussion:
      
    

    
      The ensemble of deep learning, domain knowledge, and traditional approaches recognizes question type and focus well in the simple questions, but it leaves room for improvement on the real-life consumers' questions. Information retrieval approaches alone are sufficient for finding answers to simple Alexa questions. Answering real-life questions, however, benefits from a combination of information retrieval and inference approaches. Conclusion:

For clinicians who are not fluent in English, the HPO has been translated into many languages, and there have been four initiatives to develop Japanese translations. At the Biomedical Linked Annotation Hackathon 6 (BLAH6), a rule-based approach was attempted to determine the preferable Japanese translation for each HPO term among the candidates developed by the four approaches. The relationship between the HPO and Mammalian Phenotype translations was also investigated, with the eventual goal of harmonizing the two translations to facilitate phenotype-based comparisons of species in Japanese through cross-species phenotype matching. In order to deal with the increase in the number of HPO terms and the need for manual curation, it would be useful to have a dictionary containing word-by-word correspondences and fixed translation phrases for English word order. These considerations seem applicable to HPO localization into other languages.","['1 National Institute of Public Health, Wako 351-0197, Japan.', '2 Social Cooperation Program of IT Healthcare, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan.', '3 Database Center for Life Science, Research Organization of Information and Systems, Kashiwa 277-0871, Japan.', '4 BioResource Research Center, RIKEN, Tsukuba 305-0074, Japan.', '5 National Bioscience Database Center, Japan Science and Technology Agency, Tokyo 102-8666, Japan.', '6 Advanced Research Center for Innovations in Next-Generation Medicine, Tohoku University, Sendai 980-8573, Japan.']","Kota Ninomiya, Terue Takatsuki, Tatsuya Kushida, Yasunori Yamamoto, Soichi Ogishima, ",Genomics & informatics,2020 Jun,biological ontologies; natural language processing; phenotype; rare diseases; translations.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32634877
504,Autobiographical recall of personally familiar names and temporal information in e-mails: An automatic analytic approach using e-mail communications,"An important question that arises from autobiographical memory research is whether the variables that influence memory in the laboratory also drive memory for autobiographical episodes in real life. We explored this question within the context of e-mail communications and investigated the variables that influence recall for personally familiar names and temporal information in e-mails. We designed a Web-based program that analyzed each participant's year-old sent e-mail archive and applied textual analysis algorithms to identify a set of sentences likely to be memorable. These sentences were then used as the stimuli in a cued recall task. Participants saw two sentences from their sent e-mail as a cue and attempted to recall the name of the e-mail recipient. Participants also rated the vividness of recall for the e-mail conversation and estimated the month in which they had written the e-mail. Linear mixed-effect analyses revealed that recipient name recall accuracy decreased with longer retention intervals and increased with greater frequency of contact with the recipient. Also, with longer retention intervals, participants dated e-mails as being more recent than their actual month. This telescoping error was moderately larger for e-mails with greater sentiment. These findings suggest that memory for personally familiar names and temporal information in e-mails closely follows the patterns for autobiographical memory and proper-name recall found in laboratory settings. This study introduces an innovative, Web-based experimental method for studying the cognitive processes related to autobiographical memories using ecologically valid, naturalistic communications.","['1 Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences, Washington University, St Louis, MO, USA. abhilasha.kumar@wustl.edu.', '2 Department of Computer Science, Ashoka University, Sonipat, Haryana, India.', '3 Department of Psychiatry, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.']","Abhilasha A Kumar, Sudheendra Hangal, Allyson C Rosen, ",Behavior research methods,2019 Aug,Autobiographical memory; Natural language processing; Text mining.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30719687
505,Efficient Reuse of Natural Language Processing Models for Phenotype-Mention Identification in Free-text Electronic Medical Records: A Phenotype Embedding Approach,"Background:
      
    

    
      Much effort has been put into the use of automated approaches, such as natural language processing (NLP), to mine or extract data from free-text medical records in order to construct comprehensive patient profiles for delivering better health care. Reusing NLP models in new settings, however, remains cumbersome, as it requires validation and retraining on new data iteratively to achieve convergent results. Objective:
      
    

    
      The aim of this work is to minimize the effort involved in reusing NLP models on free-text medical records. Methods:
      
    

    
      We formally define and analyze the model adaptation problem in phenotype-mention identification tasks. We identify ""duplicate waste"" and ""imbalance waste,"" which collectively impede efficient model reuse. We propose a phenotype embedding-based approach to minimize these sources of waste without the need for labelled data from new settings. Results:
      
    

    
      We conduct experiments on data from a large mental health registry to reuse NLP models in four phenotype-mention identification tasks. The proposed approach can choose the best model for a new task, identifying up to 76% waste (duplicate waste), that is, phenotype mentions without the need for validation and model retraining and with very good performance (93%-97% accuracy). It can also provide guidance for validating and retraining the selected model for novel language patterns in new tasks, saving around 80% waste (imbalance waste), that is, the effort required in ""blind"" model-adaptation approaches. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Adapting pretrained NLP models for new tasks can be more efficient and effective if the language pattern landscapes of old settings and new settings can be made explicit and comparable. Our experiments show that the phenotype-mention embedding approach is an effective way to model language patterns for phenotype-mention identification tasks and that its use can guide efficient NLP model reuse.","['1 Centre for Medical Informatics, Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.', '2 School of Computer and Software, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China.', '3 Health Data Research UK, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.', ""4 Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, United Kingdom."", '5 South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom.', '6 Centre for Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Melbourne School of Global and Population Health, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia.', '7 Health Data Research UK, University College London, London, United Kingdom.']","Honghan Wu, Karen Hodgson, Sue Dyson, Katherine I Morley, Zina M Ibrahim, Ehtesham Iqbal, Robert Stewart, Richard Jb Dobson, Cathie Sudlow, ",JMIR medical informatics,2019,clustering; electronic health records; machine learning; model adaptation; natural language processing; phenotype; phenotype embedding; text mining; word embedding.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31845899

511,Machine learning and natural language processing in psychotherapy research: Alliance as example use case,"Artificial intelligence generally and machine learning specifically have become deeply woven into the lives and technologies of modern life. Machine learning is dramatically changing scientific research and industry and may also hold promise for addressing limitations encountered in mental health care and psychotherapy. The current paper introduces machine learning and natural language processing as related methodologies that may prove valuable for automating the assessment of meaningful aspects of treatment. Prediction of therapeutic alliance from session recordings is used as a case in point. Recordings from 1,235 sessions of 386 clients seen by 40 therapists at a university counseling center were processed using automatic speech recognition software. Machine learning algorithms learned associations between client ratings of therapeutic alliance exclusively from session linguistic content. Using a portion of the data to train the model, machine learning algorithms modestly predicted alliance ratings from session content in an independent test set (Spearman's ρ = .15, p < .001). These results highlight the potential to harness natural language processing and machine learning to predict a key psychotherapy process variable that is relatively distal from linguistic content. Six practical suggestions for conducting psychotherapy research using machine learning are presented along with several directions for future research. Questions of dissemination and implementation may be particularly important to explore as machine learning improves in its ability to automate assessment of psychotherapy process and outcome.

512,A Data Element-Function Conceptual Model for Data Quality Checks,"Introduction:
      
    

    
      In aggregate, existing data quality (DQ) checks are currently represented in heterogeneous formats, making it difficult to compare, categorize, and index checks. This study contributes a data element-function conceptual model to facilitate the categorization and indexing of DQ checks and explores the feasibility of leveraging natural language processing (NLP) for scalable acquisition of knowledge of common data elements and functions from DQ checks narratives. Methods:
      
    

    
      The model defines a ""data element"", the primary focus of the check, and a ""function"", the qualitative or quantitative measure over a data element. We applied NLP techniques to extract both from 172 checks for Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) and 3,434 checks for Kaiser Permanente's Center for Effectiveness and Safety Research (CESR). Results:
      
    

    
      The model was able to classify all checks. A total of 751 unique data elements and 24 unique functions were extracted. The top five frequent data element-function pairings for OHDSI were Person-Count (55 checks), Insurance-Distribution (17), Medication-Count (16), Condition-Count (14), and Observations-Count (13); for CESR, they were Medication-Variable Type (175), Medication-Missing (172), Medication-Existence (152), Medication-Count (127), and Socioeconomic Factors-Variable Type (114). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      This study shows the efficacy of the data element-function conceptual model for classifying DQ checks, demonstrates early promise of NLP-assisted knowledge acquisition, and reveals the great heterogeneity in the focus in DQ checks, confirming variation in intrinsic checks and use-case specific ""fitness-for-use"" checks.","['1 Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, US.', '2 University of Colorado Denver Anschutz Medical Campus, US.', '3 Kaiser Permanente Northwest Center for Health Research, US.', ""4 Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, US."", '5 Department of Population Medicine, Harvard Medical School and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute, US.']","James R Rogers, Tiffany J Callahan, Tian Kang, Alan Bauck, Ritu Khare, Jeffrey S Brown, Michael G Kahn, Chunhua Weng, ","EGEMS (Washington, DC)",2019,clinical data research networks; data quality; electronic healthcare records; knowledge acquisition; natural language processing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31065558
513,Development of machine learning and natural language processing algorithms for preoperative prediction and automated identification of intraoperative vascular injury in anterior lumbar spine surgery,"Background:
      
    

    
      Intraoperative vascular injury (VI) may be an unavoidable complication of anterior lumbar spine surgery; however, vascular injury has implications for quality and safety reporting as this intraoperative complication may result in serious bleeding, thrombosis, and postoperative stricture. Purpose:
      
    

    
      The purpose of this study was to (1) develop machine learning algorithms for preoperative prediction of VI and (2) develop natural language processing (NLP) algorithms for automated surveillance of intraoperative VI from free-text operative notes. Patient sample:
      
    

    
      Adult patients, 18 years or age or older, undergoing anterior lumbar spine surgery at two academic and three community medical centers were included in this analysis. Outcome measures:
      
    

    
      The primary outcome was unintended VI during anterior lumbar spine surgery. Methods:
      
    

    
      Manual review of free-text operative notes was used to identify patients who had unintended VI. The available population was split into training and testing cohorts. Five machine learning algorithms were developed for preoperative prediction of VI. An NLP algorithm was trained for automated detection of intraoperative VI from free-text operative notes. Performance of the NLP algorithm was compared to current procedural terminology and international classification of diseases codes. Results:
      
    

    
      In all, 1035 patients underwent anterior lumbar spine surgery and the rate of intraoperative VI was 7.2% (n=75). Variables used for preoperative prediction of VI were age, male sex, body mass index, diabetes, L4-L5 exposure, and surgery for infection (discitis, osteomyelitis). The best performing machine learning algorithm achieved c-statistic of 0.73 for preoperative prediction of VI (https://sorg-apps.shinyapps.io/lumbar_vascular_injury/). For automated detection of intraoperative VI from free-text notes, the NLP algorithm achieved c-statistic of 0.92. The NLP algorithm identified 18 of the 21 patients (sensitivity 0.86) who had a VI whereas current procedural terminologyand international classification of diseases codes identified 6 of the 21 (sensitivity 0.29) patients. At this threshold, the NLP algorithm had a specificity of 0.93, negative predictive value of 0.99, positive predictive value of 0.51, and F1-score of 0.64. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Relying on administrative procedural and diagnosis codes may underestimate the rate of unintended intraoperative VI in anterior lumbar spine surgery. External and prospective validation of the algorithms presented here may improve quality and safety reporting.","['1 Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', '2 Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Newton Wellesley Hospital, Newton, MA, USA.', '3 Department of Neurosurgery, North Shore Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA.', '4 Division of Vascular & Endovascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', ""5 Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Brigham and Women's Faulkner Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", '6 Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Newton Wellesley Hospital, Newton, MA, USA.

514,Crowdbreaks: Tracking Health Trends Using Public Social Media Data and Crowdsourcing,"In the past decade, tracking health trends using social media data has shown great promise, due to a powerful combination of massive adoption of social media around the world, and increasingly potent hardware and software that enables us to work with these new big data streams. At the same time, many challenging problems have been identified. First, there is often a mismatch between how rapidly online data can change, and how rapidly algorithms are updated, which means that there is limited reusability for algorithms trained on past data as their performance decreases over time. Second, much of the work is focusing on specific issues during a specific past period in time, even though public health institutions would need flexible tools to assess multiple evolving situations in real time. Third, most tools providing such capabilities are proprietary systems with little algorithmic or data transparency, and thus little buy-in from the global public health and research community. Here, we introduce Crowdbreaks, an open platform which allows tracking of health trends by making use of continuous crowdsourced labeling of public social media content. The system is built in a way which automatizes the typical workflow from data collection, filtering, labeling and training of machine learning classifiers and therefore can greatly accelerate the research process in the public health domain. This work describes the technical aspects of the platform, thereby covering the functionalities at its current state and exploring its future use cases and extensions.","['1 Digital Epidemiology Lab, EPFL, Geneva, Switzerland.', '2 School of Life Sciences, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland.', '3 School of Computer and Communication Sciences, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland.']","Martin M Müller, Marcel Salathé, ",Frontiers in public health,2019,crowdsourcing; data mining; data stream analytics; machine learning; natural language processing (NLP); sentiment analysis (SA); social media data; vaccination.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31037238

517,Automated Methods Enable Direct Computation on Phenotypic Descriptions for Novel Candidate Gene Prediction,"Natural language descriptions of plant phenotypes are a rich source of information for genetics and genomics research. We computationally translated descriptions of plant phenotypes into structured representations that can be analyzed to identify biologically meaningful associations. These representations include the entity-quality (EQ) formalism, which uses terms from biological ontologies to represent phenotypes in a standardized, semantically rich format, as well as numerical vector representations generated using natural language processing (NLP) methods (such as the bag-of-words approach and document embedding). We compared resulting phenotype similarity measures to those derived from manually curated data to determine the performance of each method. Computationally derived EQ and vector representations were comparably successful in recapitulating biological truth to representations created through manual EQ statement curation. Moreover, NLP methods for generating vector representations of phenotypes are scalable to large quantities of text because they require no human input. These results indicate that it is now possible to computationally and automatically produce and populate large-scale information resources that enable researchers to query phenotypic descriptions directly.","['1 Department of Genetics, Development, and Cell Biology, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, United States.', '2 Interdepartmental Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, United States.', '3 Department of Agronomy, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, United States.']","Ian R Braun, Carolyn J Lawrence-Dill, ",Frontiers in plant science,2020,machine learning; natural language processing; ontology; phenologs; phenotype; semantic similarity.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31998331
518,Predicting Onset of Dementia Using Clinical Notes and Machine Learning: Case-Control Study,"Background:
      
    

    
      Clinical trials need efficient tools to assist in recruiting patients at risk of Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD). Early detection can also assist patients with financial planning for long-term care. Clinical notes are an important, underutilized source of information in machine learning models because of the cost of collection and complexity of analysis. Objective:
      
    

    
      This study aimed to investigate the use of deidentified clinical notes from multiple hospital systems collected over 10 years to augment retrospective machine learning models of the risk of developing ADRD. Methods:
      
    

    
      We used 2 years of data to predict the future outcome of ADRD onset. Clinical notes are provided in a deidentified format with specific terms and sentiments. Terms in clinical notes are embedded into a 100-dimensional vector space to identify clusters of related terms and abbreviations that differ across hospital systems and individual clinicians. Results:
      
    

    
      When using clinical notes, the area under the curve (AUC) improved from 0.85 to 0.94, and positive predictive value (PPV) increased from 45.07% (25,245/56,018) to 68.32% (14,153/20,717) in the model at disease onset. Models with clinical notes improved in both AUC and PPV in years 3-6 when notes' volume was largest; results are mixed in years 7 and 8 with the smallest cohorts. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Although clinical notes helped in the short term, the presence of ADRD symptomatic terms years earlier than onset adds evidence to other studies that clinicians undercode diagnoses of ADRD. De-identified clinical notes increase the accuracy of risk models. Clinical notes collected across multiple hospital systems via natural language processing can be merged using postprocessing techniques to aid model accuracy.","['1 OptumLabs, Optum, Cambridge, MA, United States.']","Christopher A Hane, Vijay S Nori, William H Crown, Darshak M Sanghavi, Paul Bleicher, ",JMIR medical informatics,2020,Alzheimer disease; dementia; health information interoperability; health information systems; machine learning; natural language processing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32490841
519,Predicting mechanical restraint of psychiatric inpatients by applying machine learning on electronic health data,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Mechanical restraint (MR) is used to prevent patients from harming themselves or others during inpatient treatment. The objective of this study was to investigate whether incident MR occurring in the first 3 days following admission could be predicted based on analysis of electronic health data available after the first hour of admission. Methods:
      
    

    
      The dataset consisted of clinical notes from electronic health records from the Central Denmark Region and data from the Danish Health Registers from patients admitted to a psychiatric department in the period from 2011 to 2015. Supervised machine learning algorithms were trained on a randomly selected subset of the data and validated using an independent test dataset. Results:
      
    

    
      A total of 5050 patients with 8869 admissions were included in the study. One hundred patients were mechanically restrained in the period between one hour and 3 days after the admission. A Random Forest algorithm predicted MR with an area under the curve of 0.87 (95% CI 0.79-0.93). At 94% specificity, the sensitivity was 56%. Among the ten strongest predictors, nine were derived from the clinical notes. Conclusions:

521,A Method to Learn Embedding of a Probabilistic Medical Knowledge Graph: Algorithm Development,"Background:
      
    

    
      Knowledge graph embedding is an effective semantic representation method for entities and relations in knowledge graphs. Several translation-based algorithms, including TransE, TransH, TransR, TransD, and TranSparse, have been proposed to learn effective embedding vectors from typical knowledge graphs in which the relations between head and tail entities are deterministic. However, in medical knowledge graphs, the relations between head and tail entities are inherently probabilistic. This difference introduces a challenge in embedding medical knowledge graphs. Objective:
      
    

    
      We aimed to address the challenge of how to learn the probability values of triplets into representation vectors by making enhancements to existing TransX (where X is E, H, R, D, or Sparse) algorithms, including the following: (1) constructing a mapping function between the score value and the probability, and (2) introducing probability-based loss of triplets into the original margin-based loss function. Methods:
      
    

    
      We performed the proposed PrTransX algorithm on a medical knowledge graph that we built from large-scale real-world electronic medical records data. We evaluated the embeddings using link prediction task. Results:
      
    

    
      Compared with the corresponding TransX algorithms, the proposed PrTransX performed better than the TransX model in all evaluation indicators, achieving a higher proportion of corrected entities ranked in the top 10 and normalized discounted cumulative gain of the top 10 predicted tail entities, and lower mean rank. Conclusions:

      We distributed a survey in 2016-2017 to 1731 clinician SR users at two large medical centers in Boston, Massachusetts and Aurora, Colorado. The survey asked about demographic and clinical characteristics, SR use and preferences, perceived accuracy, efficiency, and usability of SR, and overall satisfaction.

Although 29.4% of respondents did not include SR among their preferred documentation methods, 78.8% were satisfied with SR, and 77.2% agreed that SR improves efficiency. Satisfaction was associated positively with efficiency and negatively with error prevalence and editing time. Respondents were interested in further training about using SR effectively but expressed concerns regarding software reliability, editing and workflow. Discussion:
      
    

    
      Compared to other documentation methods (e.g., scribes, templates, typing, traditional dictation), SR has emerged as an effective solution, overcoming limitations inherent in other options and potentially improving efficiency while preserving documentation quality. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      While concerns about SR usability and accuracy persist, clinicians expressed positive opinions about its impact on workflow and efficiency. Faster and better approaches are needed for clinical documentation, and SR is likely to play an important role going forward.","['1 Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA.

523,"Developing a fully automated evidence synthesis tool for identifying, assessing and collating the evidence","Evidence synthesis is a key element of evidence-based medicine. However, it is currently hampered by being labour intensive meaning that many trials are not incorporated into robust evidence syntheses and that many are out of date. To overcome this, a variety of techniques are being explored, including using automation technology. Here, we describe a fully automated evidence synthesis system for intervention studies, one that identifies all the relevant evidence, assesses the evidence for reliability and collates it to estimate the relative effectiveness of an intervention. Techniques used include machine learning, natural language processing and rule-based systems. Results are visualised using modern visualisation techniques.

524,The Effect of Option Homogeneity in Multiple-Choice Items,"Previous research has found that option homogeneity in multiple-choice items affects item difficulty when items with homogeneous options are compared to the same items with heterogeneous options. This study conducted an empirical test of the effect of option homogeneity in multiple-choice items on a professional licensure examination to determine the predictability and magnitude of the change. Similarity of options to the key was determined by using subject matter experts and a natural language processing algorithm. Contrary to current research, data analysis revealed no consistent effect on item difficulty, discrimination, fit to the measurement model, or response time associated with the absence or presence of option homogeneity. While the results are negative, they call into question established guidelines in item development. A hypothesis is proposed to explain why this effect is found in some studies but not others.","['1 National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians, Columbus, OH, USA.', '2 Oncology Nursing Certification Corporation, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', '3 Pearson VUE, Chicago, IL, USA.', '4 National Council of State Boards of Nursing, Chicago, IL, USA.']","Gregory M Applegate, Karen A Sutherland, Kirk A Becker, Xiao Luo, ",Applied psychological measurement,2019 Mar,item analysis; item difficulty; item writing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30792559
525,An extensive review of tools for manual annotation of documents,"Motivation:
      
    

    
      Annotation tools are applied to build training and test corpora, which are essential for the development and evaluation of new natural language processing algorithms. Further, annotation tools are also used to extract new information for a particular use case. However, owing to the high number of existing annotation tools, finding the one that best fits particular needs is a demanding task that requires searching the scientific literature followed by installing and trying various tools. Methods:
      
    

    
      We searched for annotation tools and selected a subset of them according to five requirements with which they should comply, such as being Web-based or supporting the definition of a schema. We installed the selected tools (when necessary), carried out hands-on experiments and evaluated them using 26 criteria that covered functional and technical aspects. We defined each criterion on three levels of matches and a score for the final evaluation of the tools. Results:
      
    

    
      We evaluated 78 tools and selected the following 15 for a detailed evaluation: BioQRator, brat, Catma, Djangology, ezTag, FLAT, LightTag, MAT, MyMiner, PDFAnno, prodigy, tagtog, TextAE, WAT-SL and WebAnno. Full compliance with our 26 criteria ranged from only 9 up to 20 criteria, which demonstrated that some tools are comprehensive and mature enough to be used on most annotation projects. The highest score of 0.81 was obtained by WebAnno (of a maximum value of 1.0).","['1 German Centre for the Protection of Laboratory Animals (BfR), German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR), Berlin, Germany.']","Mariana Neves, Jurica Ševa, ",Briefings in bioinformatics,2019,annotation tools; corpus construction; manual annotation.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31838514
526,Clinical Text Data in Machine Learning: Systematic Review,"Background:
      
    

    
      Clinical narratives represent the main form of communication within health care, providing a personalized account of patient history and assessments, and offering rich information for clinical decision making. Natural language processing (NLP) has repeatedly demonstrated its feasibility to unlock evidence buried in clinical narratives. Machine learning can facilitate rapid development of NLP tools by leveraging large amounts of text data. Objective:
      
    

    
      The main aim of this study was to provide systematic evidence on the properties of text data used to train machine learning approaches to clinical NLP. We also investigated the types of NLP tasks that have been supported by machine learning and how they can be applied in clinical practice. Methods:
      
    

    
      Our methodology was based on the guidelines for performing systematic reviews. In August 2018, we used PubMed, a multifaceted interface, to perform a literature search against MEDLINE. We identified 110 relevant studies and extracted information about text data used to support machine learning, NLP tasks supported, and their clinical applications. The data properties considered included their size, provenance, collection methods, annotation, and any relevant statistics. Results:
      
    

    
      The majority of datasets used to train machine learning models included only hundreds or thousands of documents. Only 10 studies used tens of thousands of documents, with a handful of studies utilizing more. Relatively small datasets were utilized for training even when much larger datasets were available. The main reason for such poor data utilization is the annotation bottleneck faced by supervised machine learning algorithms. Active learning was explored to iteratively sample a subset of data for manual annotation as a strategy for minimizing the annotation effort while maximizing the predictive performance of the model. Supervised learning was successfully used where clinical codes integrated with free-text notes into electronic health records were utilized as class labels. Similarly, distant supervision was used to utilize an existing knowledge base to automatically annotate raw text. Where manual annotation was unavoidable, crowdsourcing was explored, but it remains unsuitable because of the sensitive nature of data considered. Besides the small volume, training data were typically sourced from a small number of institutions, thus offering no hard evidence about the transferability of machine learning models. The majority of studies focused on text classification. Most commonly, the classification results were used to support phenotyping, prognosis, care improvement, resource management, and surveillance. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We identified the data annotation bottleneck as one of the key obstacles to machine learning approaches in clinical NLP. Active learning and distant supervision were explored as a way of saving the annotation efforts. Future research in this field would benefit from alternatives such as data augmentation and transfer learning, or unsupervised learning, which do not require data annotation.","['1 School of Computer Science and Informatics, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom.', '2 Department of Computer Science, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.']","Irena Spasic, Goran Nenadic, ",JMIR medical informatics,2020,machine learning; medical informatics; medical informatics applications; natural language processing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32229465

Researchers are looking for new ways to extract knowledge to create databases and applications to help doctors treat patients and minimize medical errors. A very important part in treating a patient is to provide a fair and effective treatment for diseases. In this article we present a method of extracting important information from medical prospectuses, such as a drug-treated condition, a medicine name, a drug type, etc. To extract these entities, we use Stanford NER Tagger trained for prospectuses in Romanian language. The model was trained and tested with 3 types of medication. For each test, the accuracy of the extracted data was calculated. The extracted medical information is used to create databases with structured information that are useful for decision-support applications to check for or find suggestions for the best treatments.","['1 Department of Automation and Applied Informatics, University Politehnica.', '2 Department of Computes and Information Technology, University Politehnica.']","Oana Sorina Chirila, Ciprian-Bogdan Chirila, Lăcrămioara Stoicu-Tivadar, ",Studies in health technology and informatics,2019,Named entity recognition; Natural Language Processing; Stanford’s CoreNLP; medical prospectuses.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31349323

Information about AEs can enable their prevention. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques can identify AEs from narratives and match them to a structured terminology. We propose a novel neural network for AE normalization utilizing bidirectional long short-term memory (biLSTM) with attention mechanism that generalizes to diverse datasets. We train this network to first learn a framework for general AE normalization and then to learn the specifics of the task on individual corpora. Our results on the datasets from the Text Analysis Conference (TAC) 2017-ADR track, FDA adverse drug event evaluation shared task, and the Social Media Mining for Health Applications Workshop & Shared Task 2019 show that our approach outperforms widely used rule-based normalizers on a diverse set of narratives.

      Meaningful recognition of nurses submitted by patients and families using interactive patient care (IPC) technology was analyzed using artificial intelligence (AI) to identify the themes and behaviors associated with extraordinary nursing. Background:
      
    

    
      Meaningful recognition positively impacts nursing and organizational outcomes. The use of AI techniques such as natural language processing and machine learning to identify and describe behaviors impacting patient experiences is an emerging science. Methods:
      
    

    
      Nurse recognition comments were collected from a convenience sample of 3 organizations via an IPC inpatient platform and analyzed using the AI techniques of natural language processing, machine learning, sentiment analytics, and corollary dictionaries based on rules of linguistics. Results:
      
    

    
      The top theme of nursing recognition comments was courtesy and respect with the behaviors of empathy/compassion, helpfulness, kindness, attentiveness, and emotional comfort. The theme of skills/knowledge was the 2nd most common, with the behaviors of being professional, knowledgeable, keeping track, competence, dedication, and being thorough.

531,Use of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to Drive Personalized Medicine Approaches for Spine Care,"Personalized medicine is a new paradigm of healthcare in which interventions are based on individual patient characteristics rather than on ""one-size-fits-all"" guidelines. As epidemiological datasets continue to burgeon in size and complexity, powerful methods such as statistical machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) become necessary to interpret and develop prognostic models from underlying data. Through such analysis, machine learning can be used to facilitate personalized medicine via its precise predictions. Additionally, other AI tools, such as natural language processing and computer vision, can play an instrumental part in personalizing the care provided to patients with spine disease. In the present report, we discuss the current strides made in incorporating AI into research on spine disease, especially traumatic spinal cord injury and degenerative spine disease. We describe studies using AI to build accurate prognostic models, extract important information from medical reports via natural language processing, and evaluate functional status in a granular manner using computer vision. Through a case illustration, we have demonstrated how these breakthroughs can facilitate an increased role for more personalized medicine and, thus, change the landscape of spine care.","['1 Division of Neurosurgery, Department of Surgery, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', '2 Division of Neurosurgery, Department of Surgery, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Division of Neurosurgery, Toronto Western Hospital, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', '3 Neurosurgical Unit, Department of Biomedicine, Neurosciences and Advanced Diagnostics, University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy.', '4 Division of Neurosurgery, Department of Surgery, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Division of Neurosurgery, Toronto Western Hospital, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

532,How Will Machine Learning Inform the Clinical Care of Atrial Fibrillation?,"Machine learning applications in cardiology have rapidly evolved in the past decade. With the availability of machine learning tools coupled with vast data sources, the management of atrial fibrillation (AF), a common chronic disease with significant associated morbidity and socioeconomic impact, is undergoing a knowledge and practice transformation in the increasingly complex healthcare environment. Among other advances, deep-learning machine learning methods, including convolutional neural networks, have enabled the development of AF screening pathways using the ubiquitous 12-lead ECG to detect asymptomatic paroxysmal AF in at-risk populations (such as those with cryptogenic stroke), the refinement of AF and stroke prediction schemes through comprehensive digital phenotyping using structured and unstructured data abstraction from the electronic health record or wearable monitoring technologies, and the optimization of treatment strategies, ranging from stroke prophylaxis to monitoring of antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) therapy. Although the clinical and population-wide impact of these tools continues to be elucidated, such transformative progress does not come without challenges, such as the concerns about adopting black box technologies, assessing input data quality for training such models, and the risk of perpetuating rather than alleviating health disparities. This review critically appraises the advances of machine learning related to the care of AF thus far, their potential future directions, and its potential limitations and challenges.","['1 From the Department of Cardiovascular Medicine (K.C.S., P.A.N.), Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', '2 Robert D and Patricia E Kern Center for the Science of Health Care Delivery (X.Y.), Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', '3 Division of Health Care Policy and Research, Department of Health Sciences Research (X.Y.), Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', '4 Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA (J.P.P., A.A.P.).', '5 Division of Cardiology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston (J.P.P.).']","Konstantinos C Siontis, Xiaoxi Yao, James P Pirruccello, Anthony A Philippakis, Peter A Noseworthy, ",Circulation research,2020,ECG; artificial intelligence; atrial fibrillation; electronic health record; machine learning; natural language processing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32833571
533,Extracting Structured Genotype Information from Free-Text HLA Reports Using a Rule-Based Approach,"Background:
      
    

    
      Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing is important for transplant patients to prevent a severe mismatch reaction, and the result can also support the diagnosis of various disease or prediction of drug side effects. However, such secondary applications of HLA typing results are limited because they are typically provided in free-text format or PDFs on electronic medical records. We here propose a method to convert HLA genotype information stored in an unstructured format into a reusable structured format by extracting serotype/allele information. Methods:
      
    

    
      We queried HLA typing reports from the clinical data warehouse of Seoul National University Hospital (SUPPREME) from 2000 to 2018 as a rule-development data set (64,024 reports) and from the most recent year (6,181 reports) as a test set. We used a rule-based natural language approach using a Python regex function to extract the 1) number of patients in the report, 2) clinical characteristics such as indication of the HLA testing, and 3) precise HLA genotypes. The performance of the rules and codes was evaluated by comparison between the extracted results from the test set and a validation set generated by manual curation. Results:
      
    

    
      Among 11,287 reports for development set and 1,107 for the test set describing HLA typing for a single patient, iterative rule generation developed 124 extracting rules and 8 cleaning rules for HLA genotypes. Application of these rules extracted HLA genotypes with 0.892-0.999 precision and 0.795-0.998 recall for the five HLA genes. The precision and recall of the extracting rules for the number of patients in a report were 0.997 and 0.994 and those for the clinical variable extraction were 0.997 and 0.992, respectively. All extracted HLA alleles and serotypes were transformed according to formal HLA nomenclature by the cleaning rules. Conclusion:

      Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) data elements are contained in both structured and unstructured documents in electronic health records and require manual data collection. The goal of this study is to develop a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm to replicate manual chart review for PJI data elements. Methods:
      
    

    
      PJI was identified among all total joint arthroplasty (TJA) procedures performed at a single academic institution between 2000 and 2017. Data elements that comprise the Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS) criteria were manually extracted and used as the gold standard for validation. A training sample of 1208 TJA surgeries (170 PJI cases) was randomly selected to develop the prototype NLP algorithms and an additional 1179 surgeries (150 PJI cases) were randomly selected as the test sample. The algorithms were applied to all consultation notes, operative notes, pathology reports, and microbiology reports to predict the correct status of PJI based on MSIS criteria. Results:
      
    

    
      The algorithm, which identified patients with PJI based on MSIS criteria, achieved an f1-score (harmonic mean of precision and recall) of 0.911. Algorithm performance in extracting the presence of sinus tract, purulence, pathologic documentation of inflammation, and growth of cultured organisms from the involved TJA achieved f1-scores that ranged from 0.771 to 0.982, sensitivity that ranged from 0.730 to 1.000, and specificity that ranged from 0.947 to 1.000. Conclusion:

      The aims of this study were to assess follow-up recommendations in radiology reports, develop and assess traditional machine learning (TML) and deep learning (DL) models in identifying follow-up, and benchmark them against a natural language processing (NLP) system. Methods:
      
    

    
      This HIPAA-compliant, institutional review board-approved study was performed at an academic medical center generating >500,000 radiology reports annually. One thousand randomly selected ultrasound, radiography, CT, and MRI reports generated in 2016 were manually reviewed and annotated for follow-up recommendations. TML (support vector machines, random forest, logistic regression) and DL (recurrent neural nets) algorithms were constructed and trained on 850 reports (training data), with subsequent optimization of model architectures and parameters. Precision, recall, and F1 score were calculated on the remaining 150 reports (test data). A previously developed and validated NLP system (iSCOUT) was also applied to the test data, with equivalent metrics calculated. Results:
      
    

    
      Follow-up recommendations were present in 12.7% of reports. The TML algorithms achieved F1 scores of 0.75 (random forest), 0.83 (logistic regression), and 0.85 (support vector machine) on the test data. DL recurrent neural nets had an F1 score of 0.71; iSCOUT also had an F1 score of 0.71. Performance of both TML and DL methods by F1 scores appeared to plateau after 500 to 700 samples while training.

536,Promoting Reproducible Research for Characterizing Nonmedical Use of Medications Through Data Annotation: Description of a Twitter Corpus and Guidelines,"Background:
      
    

    
      Social media data are being increasingly used for population-level health research because it provides near real-time access to large volumes of consumer-generated data. Recently, a number of studies have explored the possibility of using social media data, such as from Twitter, for monitoring prescription medication abuse. However, there is a paucity of annotated data or guidelines for data characterization that discuss how information related to abuse-prone medications is presented on Twitter. Objective:
      
    

    
      This study discusses the creation of an annotated corpus suitable for training supervised classification algorithms for the automatic classification of medication abuse-related chatter. The annotation strategies used for improving interannotator agreement (IAA), a detailed annotation guideline, and machine learning experiments that illustrate the utility of the annotated corpus are also described. Methods:
      
    

    
      We employed an iterative annotation strategy, with interannotator discussions held and updates made to the annotation guidelines at each iteration to improve IAA for the manual annotation task. Using the grounded theory approach, we first characterized tweets into fine-grained categories and then grouped them into 4 broad classes-abuse or misuse, personal consumption, mention, and unrelated. After the completion of manual annotations, we experimented with several machine learning algorithms to illustrate the utility of the corpus and generate baseline performance metrics for automatic classification on these data. Results:
      
    

    
      Our final annotated set consisted of 16,443 tweets mentioning at least 20 abuse-prone medications including opioids, benzodiazepines, atypical antipsychotics, central nervous system stimulants, and gamma-aminobutyric acid analogs. Our final overall IAA was 0.86 (Cohen kappa), which represents high agreement. The manual annotation process revealed the variety of ways in which prescription medication misuse or abuse is discussed on Twitter, including expressions indicating coingestion, nonmedical use, nonstandard route of intake, and consumption above the prescribed doses. Among machine learning classifiers, support vector machines obtained the highest automatic classification accuracy of 73.00% (95% CI 71.4-74.5) over the test set (n=3271). Conclusions:

537,Frequency of Clinicians' Assessments for Access to Lethal Means in Persons at Risk for Suicide,"Objective: We measured the frequency of clinicians' assessments for access to lethal means, including firearms and medications in patients at risk of suicide from electronic medical and mental health records in outpatient and emergency settings.Methods: We included adult patients who reported suicide ideation on the PHQ-9 depression screener in behavioral health and primary care outpatient settings of a large integrated health system in the U.S. and those with suicidal behavior treated in the emergency department. Two separate natural language processing queries were developed on medical record text documentation: (1) assessment for access to firearms (8,994 patients), (2) assessment for access to medications (4,939 patients).Results: Only 35% of patients had documentation of firearm or medication assessment in the month following treatment for suicidal behavior in the emergency setting. Among those reporting suicidal ideation in outpatient setting, 31% had documentation of firearm assessment and 23% for medication assessment. The accuracy of the estimates was very good for firearm assessment (F1 = 89%) and medication assessment in the outpatient setting (F1 = 91%) and fair for medication assessment in the emergency setting (F1 = 70%) due to more varied documentation styles.Conclusions: Lethal means assessment following report of suicidal ideation or behavior is low in a nonacademic health care setting.

538,An Analysis of Public Opinions Regarding Take-Away Food Safety: A 2015-2018 Case Study on Sina Weibo,"Take-away food (also referred to as ""take-out"" food in different regions of the world) is a very convenient and popular dining choice for millions of people. In this article, we collect online textual data regarding ""take-away food safety"" from Sina Weibo between 2015 and 2018 using the Octopus Collector. After the posts from Sina Weibo were preprocessed, users' emotions and opinions were analyzed using natural language processing. To our knowledge, little work has studied public opinions regarding take-away food safety. This paper fills this gap by using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and k-means to extract and cluster topics from the posts, allowing for the users' emotions and related opinions to be mined and analyzed. The results of this research are as follows: (1) data analysis showed that the degree of topics have increased over the years, and there are a variety of topics about take-away food safety; (2) emotional analysis showed that 93.8% of the posts were positive; and (3) topic analysis showed that the topic of public discussion is diverse and rich. Our analysis of public opinion on take-away food safety generates insights for government and industry stakeholders to promote the healthy and vigorous development of the food industry.","['1 School of Economics and Management, China University of Petroleum, Beijing 102249, China.', '2 Department of Industrial and System Engineering, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY 14260, USA.']","Cen Song, Chunyu Guo, Kyle Hunt, Jun Zhuang, ","Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",2020,emotional analysis; food safety; natural language processing; online public opinion; take-away food; topic analysis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32325650
539,RedMed: Extending drug lexicons for social media applications,"Social media has been identified as a promising potential source of information for pharmacovigilance. The adoption of social media data has been hindered by the massive and noisy nature of the data. Initial attempts to use social media data have relied on exact text matches to drugs of interest, and therefore suffer from the gap between formal drug lexicons and the informal nature of social media. The Reddit comment archive represents an ideal corpus for bridging this gap. We trained a word embedding model, RedMed, to facilitate the identification and retrieval of health entities from Reddit data. We compare the performance of our model trained on a consumer-generated corpus against publicly available models trained on expert-generated corpora. Our automated classification pipeline achieves an accuracy of 0.88 and a specificity of >0.9 across four different term classes. Of all drug mentions, an average of 79% (±0.5%) were exact matches to a generic or trademark drug name, 14% (±0.5%) were misspellings, 6.4% (±0.3%) were synonyms, and 0.13% (±0.05%) were pill marks. We find that our system captures an additional 20% of mentions; these would have been missed by approaches that rely solely on exact string matches. We provide a lexicon of misspellings and synonyms for 2978 drugs and a word embedding model trained on a health-oriented subset of Reddit.","['1 Biomedical Informatics Training Program, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', '2 Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.

540,"Using Natural Language Processing to Examine the Uptake, Content, and Readability of Media Coverage of a Pan-Canadian Drug Safety Research Project: Cross-Sectional Observational Study","Background:
      
    

    
      Isotretinoin, for treating cystic acne, increases the risk of miscarriage and fetal abnormalities when taken during pregnancy. The Health Canada-approved product monograph for isotretinoin includes pregnancy prevention guidelines. A recent study by the Canadian Network for Observational Drug Effect Studies (CNODES) on the occurrence of pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes during isotretinoin therapy estimated poor adherence to these guidelines. Media uptake of this study was unknown; awareness of this uptake could help improve drug safety communication. Objective:
      
    

    
      The aim of this study was to understand how the media present pharmacoepidemiological research using the CNODES isotretinoin study as a case study. Methods:
      
    

    
      Google News was searched (April 25-May 6, 2016), using a predefined set of terms, for mention of the CNODES study. In total, 26 articles and 3 CNODES publications (original article, press release, and podcast) were identified. The article texts were cleaned (eg, advertisements and links removed), and the podcast was transcribed. A dictionary of 1295 unique words was created using natural language processing (NLP) techniques (term frequency-inverse document frequency, Porter stemming, and stop-word filtering) to identify common words and phrases. Similarity between the articles and reference publications was calculated using Euclidian distance; articles were grouped using hierarchical agglomerative clustering. Nine readability scales were applied to measure text readability based on factors such as number of words, difficult words, syllables, sentence counts, and other textual metrics. Results:
      
    

    
      The top 5 dictionary words were pregnancy (250 appearances), isotretinoin (220), study (209), drug (201), and women (185). Three distinct clusters were identified: Clusters 2 (5 articles) and 3 (4 articles) were from health-related websites and media, respectively; Cluster 1 (18 articles) contained largely media sources; 2 articles fell outside these clusters. Use of the term isotretinoin versus Accutane (a brand name of isotretinoin), discussion of pregnancy complications, and assignment of responsibility for guideline adherence varied between clusters. For example, the term pregnanc appeared most often in Clusters 1 (14.6 average times per article) and 2 (11.4) and relatively infrequently in Cluster 3 (1.8). Average readability for all articles was high (eg, Flesch-Kincaid, 13; Gunning Fog, 15; SMOG Index, 10; Coleman Liau Index, 15; Linsear Write Index, 13; and Text Standard, 13). Readability increased from Cluster 2 (Gunning Fog of 16.9) to 3 (12.2). It varied between clusters (average 13th-15th grade) but exceeded the recommended health information reading level (grade 6th to 8th), overall. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Media interpretation of the CNODES study varied, with differences in synonym usage and areas of focus. All articles were written above the recommended health information reading level. Analyzing media using NLP techniques can help determine drug safety communication effectiveness. This project is important for understanding how drug safety studies are taken up and redistributed in the media.","['1 Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada.', '2 Nova Scotia Health Authority, Halifax, NS, Canada.', '3 University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.']","Hossein Mohammadhassanzadeh, Ingrid Sketris, Robyn Traynor, Susan Alexander, Brandace Winquist, Samuel Alan Stewart, ",JMIR formative research,2020,knowledge translation; mass media; natural language processing; pharmacoepidemiology; readability.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31934872
541,Deep learning to convert unstructured CT pulmonary angiography reports into structured reports,"Background:
      
    

    
      Structured reports have been shown to improve communication between radiologists and providers. However, some radiologists are concerned about resultant decreased workflow efficiency. We tested a machine learning-based algorithm designed to convert unstructured computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) reports into structured reports. Methods:
      
    

    
      A self-supervised convolutional neural network-based algorithm was trained on a dataset of 475 manually structured CTPA reports. Labels for individual statements included ""pulmonary arteries,"" ""lungs and airways,"" ""pleura,"" ""mediastinum and lymph nodes,"" ""cardiovascular,"" ""soft tissues and bones,"" ""upper abdomen,"" and ""lines/tubes."" The algorithm was applied to a test set of 400 unstructured CTPA reports, generating a predicted label for each statement, which was evaluated by two independent observers. Per-statement accuracy was calculated based on strict criteria (algorithm label counted as correct if the statement unequivocally contained content only related to that particular label) and a modified criteria, accounting for problematic statements, including typographical errors, statements that did not fit well into the classification scheme, statements containing content for multiple labels, etc. RESULTS: Of the 4,157 statements, 3,806 (91.6%) and 3,986 (95.9%) were correctly labeled by the algorithm using strict and modified criteria, respectively, while 274 (6.6%) were problematic for the manual observers to label, the majority of which (n = 173) were due to more than one section being included in one statement. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      This algorithm showed high accuracy in converting free-text findings into structured reports, which could improve communication between radiologists and clinicians without loss of productivity and provide more structured data for research/data mining applications.","['1 Department of Radiology, Medical University of South Carolina, 171 Ashley Avenue, Charleston, SC, 29425, USA.', '2 Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc., 40 Liberty Boulevard, Malvern, PA, 19355, USA.', '3 Department of Radiology, Medical University of South Carolina, 171 Ashley Avenue, Charleston, SC, 29425, USA. nanceradiology@gmail.com.']","Adam Spandorfer, Cody Branch, Puneet Sharma, Pooyan Sahbaee, U Joseph Schoepf, James G Ravenel, John W Nance, ",European radiology experimental,2019,"Artificial intelligence; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Structured reporting; Tomography (x-ray, computed).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31549323
542,Automated screening of natural language in electronic health records for the diagnosis septic shock is feasible and outperforms an approach based on explicit administrative codes,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      Identification of patients for epidemiologic research through administrative coding has important limitations. We investigated the feasibility of a search based on natural language processing (NLP) on the text sections of electronic health records for identification of patients with septic shock. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      Results of an explicit search strategy (using explicit concept retrieval) and a combined search strategy (using both explicit and implicit concept retrieval) were compared to hospital ICD-9 based administrative coding and to our department's own prospectively compiled infection database. Results:
      
    

    
      Of 8911 patients admitted to the medical or surgical ICU, 1023 (11.5%) suffered from septic shock according to the combined search strategy. This was significantly more than those identified by the explicit strategy (518, 5.8%), by hospital administrative coding (549, 5.8%) or by our own prospectively compiled database (609, 6.8%) (p < .001). Sensitivity and specificity of the automated combined search strategy were 72.7% (95%CI 69.0%-76.2%) and 93.0% (95%CI 92.4%-93.6%), compared to 56.0% (95%CI 52.0%-60.0%) and 97.5% (95%CI 97.1%-97.8%) for hospital administrative coding.

      Recent efforts to update the definitions and taxonomic structure of concepts related to pain have revealed opportunities to better quantify topics of existing pain research subject areas. Methods:
      
    

    
      Here, we apply basic natural language processing (NLP) analyses on a corpus of >200,000 abstracts published on PubMed under the medical subject heading (MeSH) of ""pain"" to quantify the topics, content, and themes on pain-related research dating back to the 1940s. Results:
      
    

    
      The most common stemmed terms included ""pain"" (601,122 occurrences), ""patient"" (508,064 occurrences), and ""studi-"" (208,839 occurrences). Contrarily, terms with the highest term frequency-inverse document frequency included ""tmd"" (6.21), ""qol"" (6.01), and ""endometriosis"" (5.94). Using the vector-embedded model of term definitions available via the ""word2vec"" technique, the most similar terms to ""pain"" included ""discomfort,"" ""symptom,"" and ""pain-related."" For the term ""acute,"" the most similar terms in the word2vec vector space included ""nonspecific,"" ""vaso-occlusive,"" and ""subacute""; for the term ""chronic,"" the most similar terms included ""persistent,"" ""longstanding,"" and ""long-standing."" Topic modeling via Latent Dirichlet analysis identified peak coherence (0.49) at 40 topics. Network analysis of these topic models identified three topics that were outliers from the core cluster, two of which pertained to women's health and obstetrics and were closely connected to one another, yet considered distant from the third outlier pertaining to age. A deep learning-based gated recurrent units abstract generation model successfully synthesized several unique abstracts with varying levels of believability, with special attention and some confusion at lower temperatures to the roles of placebo in randomized controlled trials.

544,Linking entities through an ontology using word embeddings and syntactic re-ranking,"Background:
      
    

    
      Although there is an enormous number of textual resources in the biomedical domain, currently, manually curated resources cover only a small part of the existing knowledge. The vast majority of these information is in unstructured form which contain nonstandard naming conventions. The task of named entity recognition, which is the identification of entity names from text, is not adequate without a standardization step. Linking each identified entity mention in text to an ontology/dictionary concept is an essential task to make sense of the identified entities. This paper presents an unsupervised approach for the linking of named entities to concepts in an ontology/dictionary. We propose an approach for the normalization of biomedical entities through an ontology/dictionary by using word embeddings to represent semantic spaces, and a syntactic parser to give higher weight to the most informative word in the named entity mentions. Results:
      
    

    
      We applied the proposed method to two different normalization tasks: the normalization of bacteria biotope entities through the Onto-Biotope ontology and the normalization of adverse drug reaction entities through the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The proposed method achieved a precision score of 65.9%, which is 2.9 percentage points above the state-of-the-art result on the BioNLP Shared Task 2016 Bacteria Biotope test data and a macro-averaged precision score of 68.7% on the Text Analysis Conference 2017 Adverse Drug Reaction test data. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The core contribution of this paper is a syntax-based way of combining the individual word vectors to form vectors for the named entity mentions and ontology concepts, which can then be used to measure the similarity between them. The proposed approach is unsupervised and does not require labeled data, making it easily applicable to different domains.","['1 Department of Computer Engineering, Boğaziçi University, İstanbul, 34342, Turkey.', '2 Department of Computer Engineering, Boğaziçi University, İstanbul, 34342, Turkey. arzucan.ozgur@boun.edu.tr.']","İlknur Karadeniz, Arzucan Özgür, ",BMC bioinformatics,2019,Adverse drug reactions; Bacteria biotopes; Entity categorization; Entity linking; Named entity normalization; Natural language processing; Text mining; Word embeddings.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30917789
545,Medical knowledge infused convolutional neural networks for cohort selection in clinical trials,"Objective:
      
    

    
      In this era of digitized health records, there has been a marked interest in using de-identified patient records for conducting various health related surveys. To assist in this research effort, we developed a novel clinical data representation model entitled medical knowledge-infused convolutional neural network (MKCNN), which is used for learning the clinical trial criteria eligibility status of patients to participate in cohort studies. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      In this study, we propose a clinical text representation infused with medical knowledge (MK). First, we isolate the noise from the relevant data using a medically relevant description extractor; then we utilize log-likelihood ratio based weights from selected sentences to highlight ""met"" and ""not-met"" knowledge-infused representations in bichannel setting for each instance. The combined medical knowledge-infused representation (MK) from these modules helps identify significant clinical criteria semantics, which in turn renders effective learning when used with a convolutional neural network architecture. Results:
      
    

    
      MKCNN outperforms other Medical Knowledge (MK) relevant learning architectures by approximately 3%; notably SVM and XGBoost implementations developed in this study. MKCNN scored 86.1% on F1metric, a gain of 6% above the average performance assessed from the submissions for n2c2 task. Although pattern/rule-based methods show a higher average performance for the n2c2 clinical data set, MKCNN significantly improves performance of machine learning implementations for clinical datasets. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      MKCNN scored 86.1% on the F1 score metric. In contrast to many of the rule-based systems introduced during the n2c2 challenge workshop, our system presents a model that heavily draws on machine-based learning. In addition, the MK representations add more value to clinical comprehension and interpretation of natural texts.","['1 Graduate Institute of Data Science, College of Management, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', '2 Institute of Biomedical Informatics, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', '3 Bioinformatics Program, Taiwan International Graduate Program, Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.', '4 Clinical Big Data Research Center, Taipei Medical University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', '5 Pervasive AI Research Labs, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan.', '6 Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.']","Chi-Jen Chen, Neha Warikoo, Yung-Chun Chang, Jin-Hua Chen, Wen-Lian Hsu, ",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2019,clinical trials; cohort selection; convolutional neural network; medical records; natural language processing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31390470
546,Implementation of an Artificial Intelligence-Based Double Read System in Capturing Pulmonary Nodule Discrepancy in CT Studies,"Studies show that up to 80% of all radiology errors are due to errors in perception. Early detection is critical for good outcomes in patients with primary lung cancer and lung metastasis. However, pulmonary nodules can be easily missed due to their small size. We prospectively applied a machine vision algorithm to CT studies containing lung parenchyma to detect pulmonary nodules, as well as a natural language processing algorithm to the text of the report to identify documentation of pulmonary nodules. Apparent discrepancies in perception - instances where a pulmonary nodule was not reported - were flagged for a secondary review by a radiologist. Four thousand and nine hundred studies were prospectively processed, of which 450 cases with potential discrepancies were detected. Preliminary manual analysis was performed to analyze the base error rate and to optimize thresholds for the machine vision and natural language processing algorithms, and 104 cases were flagged for final review. Of these 104 cases, 50 cases contained undocumented pulmonary nodules. Among these cases, 7 cases were classified as likely to be significant, where report addendums were done and the clinicians notified. We have successfully implemented an automated double read system to detect pulmonary nodule discrepancies, with minimal disruption to the radiology workflow and while keeping personal health information on-premises. This successful implementation demonstrates the viability of using an automated and secure radiology double-read system to improve patient safety in radiology workflows, either at a health system or an independent radiology practice.","['1 Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore, Singapore.

The annotation is based on Spatial Role Labeling. The information includes annotating a radiographic finding, its associated anatomical location, any potential diagnosis described in connection to the spatial relation (between finding and location), and any hedging phrase used to describe the certainty level of a finding/diagnosis. All these annotations are identified with reference to a spatial expression (or Spatial Indicator) that triggers a spatial relation in a sentence. The spatial roles used to encode the spatial information are Trajector, Landmark, Diagnosis, and Hedge. In total, there are 1962 Spatial Indicators (mainly prepositions). There are 2293 Trajectors, 2167 Landmarks, 455 Diagnosis, and 388 Hedges in the dataset. This annotated dataset can be used for developing automatic approaches targeted toward spatial information extraction from radiology reports which then can be applied to numerous clinical applications.

548,Criteria2Query: a natural language interface to clinical databases for cohort definition,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Cohort definition is a bottleneck for conducting clinical research and depends on subjective decisions by domain experts. Data-driven cohort definition is appealing but requires substantial knowledge of terminologies and clinical data models. Criteria2Query is a natural language interface that facilitates human-computer collaboration for cohort definition and execution using clinical databases. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      Criteria2Query uses a hybrid information extraction pipeline combining machine learning and rule-based methods to systematically parse eligibility criteria text, transforms it first into a structured criteria representation and next into sharable and executable clinical data queries represented as SQL queries conforming to the OMOP Common Data Model. Users can interactively review, refine, and execute queries in the ATLAS web application. To test effectiveness, we evaluated 125 criteria across different disease domains from ClinicalTrials.gov and 52 user-entered criteria. We evaluated F1 score and accuracy against 2 domain experts and calculated the average computation time for fully automated query formulation. We conducted an anonymous survey evaluating usability. Results:
      
    

    
      Criteria2Query achieved 0.795 and 0.805 F1 score for entity recognition and relation extraction, respectively. Accuracies for negation detection, logic detection, entity normalization, and attribute normalization were 0.984, 0.864, 0.514 and 0.793, respectively. Fully automatic query formulation took 1.22 seconds/criterion. More than 80% (11+ of 13) of users would use Criteria2Query in their future cohort definition tasks. Conclusions:

      Utilisation of routinely collected electronic health records from secondary care offers unprecedented possibilities for medical science research but can also present difficulties. One key issue is that medical information is presented as free-form text and, therefore, requires time commitment from clinicians to manually extract salient information. Natural language processing (NLP) methods can be used to automatically extract clinically relevant information. Objective:
      
    

    
      Our aim is to use natural language processing (NLP) to capture real-world data on individuals with depression from the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) clinical text to foster the use of electronic healthcare data in mental health research. Methods:
      
    

    
      We used a combination of methods to extract salient information from electronic health records. First, clinical experts define the information of interest and subsequently build the training and testing corpora for statistical models. Second, we built and fine-tuned the statistical models using active learning procedures. Findings:

To assist in this complex decision making, we investigate the effectiveness of different ranking models based on the BERT models under the same retrieval platform to ensure fair comparisons. An evaluation on the TREC Precision Medicine benchmarks indicates that our approach using the BERT model pre-trained on scientific abstracts and clinical notes achieves state-of-the-art results, on par with highly specialised, manually optimised heuristic models. We also report the best results to date on the TREC Precision Medicine 2017 ad hoc retrieval task for clinical trial search.","['1 CSIRO Data61, Marsfield, NSW, Australia.

552,Ontology-based clinical information extraction from physician's free-text notes,"Documenting clinical notes in electronic health records might affect physician's workflow. In this paper, an Ontology-based clinical information extraction system, OB-CIE, has been developed. OB-CIE system provides a method for extracting clinical concepts from physician's free-text notes and converts the unstructured clinical notes to structured information to be accessed in electronic health records. OB-CIE system can help physicians to document visit notes without changing their workflow. For recognizing named entities of clinical concepts, ontology concepts have been used to construct a dictionary of semantic categories, then, exact dictionary matching method has been used to match noun phrases to their semantic categories. A rule-based approach has been used to classify clinical sentences to their predefined categories. The system evaluation results have achieved an F-measure of 94.90% and 97.80% for concepts classification and sentences classification, respectively. The results have showed that OB-CIE system performed well on extracting clinical concepts compared with data mining techniques. The system can be used in another field by adapting its ontology and extraction rule set.","['1 Information Systems Department, Faculty of Computers and Information, Helwan University, Helwan, Cairo, Egypt; Business Information Systems Department, Faculty of Commerce and Business Administration, Helwan University, Helwan, Cairo, Egypt.

553,Use of Natural Language Processing for Precise Retrieval of Key Elements of Health IT Evaluation Studies,"Having precise information about health IT evaluation studies is important for evidence-based decisions in medical informatics. In a former feasibility study, we used a faceted search based on ontological modeling of key elements of studies to retrieve precisely described health IT evaluation studies. However, extracting the key elements manually for the modeling of the ontology was time and resource-intensive. We now aimed at applying natural language processing to substitute manual data extraction by automatic data extraction. Four methods (Named Entity Recognition, Bag-of-Words, Term-Frequency-Inverse-Document-Frequency, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation Topic Modeling were applied to 24 health IT evaluation studies. We evaluated which of these methods was best suited for extracting key elements of each study. As gold standard, we used results from manual extraction. As a result, Named Entity Recognition is promising but needs to be adapted to the existing study context. After the adaption, key elements of studies could be collected in a more feasible, time- and resource-saving way.","['1 Institute of Medical Informatics, UMIT - Private University for Health Sciences, Medical Informatics and Technology GmbH, Hall in Tirol, Austria.', '2 Institute of Medical Informatics, Statistics and Epidemiology, University of Leipzig, Germany.']","Verena Dornauer, Franziska Jahn, Konrad Hoeffner, Alfred Winter, Elske Ammenwerth, ",Studies in health technology and informatics,2020,evaluation studies; health IT; natural language processing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32604609

In addition, the sentiment of each group's speech was compared using IBM Watson's sentiment classification functionality. Key findings suggest that some topics-such as the issue of ""enhancement,"" the parent-child relationship, or the role of China-are covered very disproportionately by different groups of authors, and that the current discourse regarding gene editing has not demonstrated extensive consideration of the perspectives of the disabled, religious adherents, or other relevant interest groups.

      We developed medExtractR, a natural language processing system to extract medication information from clinical notes. Using a targeted approach, medExtractR focuses on individual drugs to facilitate creation of medication-specific research datasets from electronic health records. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      Written using the R programming language, medExtractR combines lexicon dictionaries and regular expressions to identify relevant medication entities (eg, drug name, strength, frequency). MedExtractR was developed on notes from Vanderbilt University Medical Center, using medications prescribed with varying complexity. We evaluated medExtractR and compared it with 3 existing systems: MedEx, MedXN, and CLAMP (Clinical Language Annotation, Modeling, and Processing). We also demonstrated how medExtractR can be easily tuned for better performance on an outside dataset using the MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III) database. Results:
      
    

    
      On 50 test notes per development drug and 110 test notes for an additional drug, medExtractR achieved high overall performance (F-measures >0.95), exceeding performance of the 3 existing systems across all drugs. MedExtractR achieved the highest F-measure for each individual entity, except drug name and dose amount for allopurinol. With tuning and customization, medExtractR achieved F-measures >0.90 in the MIMIC-III dataset. Discussion:
      
    

    
      The medExtractR system successfully extracted entities for medications of interest. High performance in entity-level extraction provides a strong foundation for developing robust research datasets for pharmacological research. When working with new datasets, medExtractR should be tuned on a small sample of notes before being broadly applied. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The medExtractR system achieved high performance extracting specific medications from clinical text, leading to higher-quality research datasets for drug-related studies than some existing general-purpose medication extraction tools.","['1 Department of Biostatistics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', '2 Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', '3 Department of Biomedical Informatics, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.']","Hannah L Weeks, Cole Beck, Elizabeth McNeer, Michael L Williams, Cosmin A Bejan, Joshua C Denny, Leena Choi, ",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2020,medication extraction; medication population study; natural language processing; real world data.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31943012
558,Studying expressions of loneliness in individuals using twitter: an observational study,"Objectives:
      
    

    
      Loneliness is a major public health problem and an estimated 17% of adults aged 18-70 in the USA reported being lonely. We sought to characterise the (online) lives of people who mention the words 'lonely' or 'alone' in their Twitter timeline and correlate their posts with predictors of mental health. Setting and design:
      
    

    
      From approximately 400 million tweets collected from Twitter in Pennsylvania, USA, between 2012 and 2016, we identified users whose Twitter posts contained the words 'lonely' or 'alone' and compared them to a control group matched by age, gender and period of posting. Using natural-language processing, we characterised the topics and diurnal patterns of users' posts, their association with linguistic markers of mental health and if language can predict manifestations of loneliness. The statistical analysis, data synthesis and model creation were conducted in 2018-2019. Primary outcome measures:
      
    

    
      We evaluated counts of language features in the users with posts including the words lonely or alone compared with the control group. These language features were measured by (a) open-vocabulary topics, (b) Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC) lexicon, (c) linguistic markers of anger, depression and anxiety, and (d) temporal patterns and number of drug words. Using machine learning, we also evaluated if expressions of loneliness can be predicted in users' timelines, measured by area under curve (AUC). Results:
      
    

    
      Twitter timelines of users (n=6202) with posts including the words lonely or alone were found to include themes about difficult interpersonal relationships, psychosomatic symptoms, substance use, wanting change, unhealthy eating and having troubles with sleep. Their posts were also associated with linguistic markers of anger, depression and anxiety. A random forest model predicted expressions of loneliness online with an AUC of 0.86. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Users' Twitter timelines with the words lonely or alone often include psychosocial features and can potentially have associations with how individuals express and experience loneliness. This can inform low-resource online assessment for high-risk individuals experiencing loneliness and interventions focused on addressing morbidities in this condition.","['1 Computer and Information Science, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States sharathg@sas.upenn.edu.', '2 Center for Digital Health, Penn Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, United States.', '3 Perelmen School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.', '4 Computer and Information Science, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States.', ""5 Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, United States."", '6 Positive Psychology Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.', '7 The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.']","Sharath Chandra Guntuku, Rachelle Schneider, Arthur Pelullo, Jami Young, Vivien Wong, Lyle Ungar, Daniel Polsky, Kevin G Volpp, Raina Merchant, ",BMJ open,2019,loneliness mentions; mental health; natural language processing; social media; twitter.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31685502

In the course of this project it was discovered that important information are only available in form of free texts instead of structured data and can therefore not be processed by standard ETL tools, which is necessary to establish a digital expert system for rejection diagnostics. Due to this reason, data integration has been improved by a combination of methods from natural language processing and methods from image processing.

563,Assessment of Deep Natural Language Processing in Ascertaining Oncologic Outcomes From Radiology Reports,"Importance:
      
    

    
      A rapid learning health care system for oncology will require scalable methods for extracting clinical end points from electronic health records (EHRs). Outside of clinical trials, end points such as cancer progression and response are not routinely encoded into structured data. Objective:
      
    

    
      To determine whether deep natural language processing can extract relevant cancer outcomes from radiologic reports, a ubiquitous but unstructured EHR data source. Design, setting, and participants:
      
    

    
      A retrospective cohort study evaluated 1112 patients who underwent tumor genotyping for a diagnosis of lung cancer and participated in the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute PROFILE study from June 26, 2013, to July 2, 2018. Exposures:
      
    

    
      Patients were divided into curation and reserve sets. Human abstractors applied a structured framework to radiologic reports for the curation set to ascertain the presence of cancer and changes in cancer status over time (ie, worsening/progressing vs improving/responding). Deep learning models were then trained to capture these outcomes from report text and subsequently evaluated in a 10% held-out test subset of curation patients. Cox proportional hazards regression models compared human and machine curations of disease-free survival, progression-free survival, and time to improvement/response in the curation set, and measured associations between report classification and overall survival in the curation and reserve sets. Main outcomes and measures:
      
    

    
      The primary outcome was area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for deep learning models; secondary outcomes were time to improvement/response, disease-free survival, progression-free survival, and overall survival. Results:
      
    

    
      A total of 2406 patients were included (mean [SD] age, 66.5 [10.8] years; 1428 female [59.7%]; 2170 [90.2%] white). Radiologic reports (n = 14 230) were manually reviewed for 1112 patients in the curation set. In the test subset (n = 109), deep learning models identified the presence of cancer, improvement/response, and worsening/progression with accurate discrimination (AUC >0.90). Machine and human curation yielded similar measurements of disease-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] for machine vs human curation, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.71-1.95); progression-free survival (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.71-1.71); and time to improvement/response (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.65-1.64). Among 15 000 additional reports for 1294 reserve set patients, algorithm-detected cancer worsening/progression was associated with decreased overall survival (HR for mortality, 4.04; 95% CI, 2.78-5.85), and improvement/response was associated with increased overall survival (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.22-0.77).

      Medical errors are a leading cause of death in the United States. Despite widespread adoption of patient safety reporting systems to address medical errors, making sense of the reports collected in these systems is challenging in practice. Event classification taxonomies used in many reporting systems can be complex and difficult to understand by frontline reporters, leading reporters to classify reports as ""miscellaneous"" as opposed to assigning a specific event-type category, which may facilitate analysis. Methods:
      
    

    
      To assist patient safety analysts in their analysis of ""miscellaneous"" reports, we developed an ensemble machine learning natural language processing model to reclassify these reports. We integrated the model into a clinical workflow dashboard, evaluated user feedback, and compared differences in user thresholds for model performance. Results and conclusions:

565,Integrated Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning Models for Standardizing Radiotherapy Structure Names,"The lack of standardized structure names in radiotherapy (RT) data limits interoperability, data sharing, and the ability to perform big data analysis. To standardize radiotherapy structure names, we developed an integrated natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) based system that can map the physician-given structure names to American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) Task Group 263 (TG-263) standard names. The dataset consist of 794 prostate and 754 lung cancer patients across the 40 different radiation therapy centers managed by the Veterans Health Administration (VA). Additionally, data from the Radiation Oncology department at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) was collected to serve as a test set. Domain experts identified as anatomically significant nine prostate and ten lung organs-at-risk (OAR) structures and manually labeled them according to the TG-263 standards, and remaining structures were labeled as Non_OAR. We experimented with six different classification algorithms and three feature vector methods, and the final model was built with fastText algorithm. Multiple validation techniques are used to assess the robustness of the proposed methodology. The macro-averaged F 1 score was used as the main evaluation metric. The model achieved an F 1 score of 0.97 on prostate structures and 0.99 for lung structures from the VA dataset. The model also performed well on the test (VCU) dataset, achieving an F 1 score of 0.93 for prostate structures and 0.95 on lung structures. In this work, we demonstrate that NLP and ML based approaches can used to standardize the physician-given RT structure names with high fidelity.

567,Discovering New Social Determinants of Health Concepts from Unstructured Data: Framework and Evaluation,"Social determinants of health (SDoH) are the complex set of circumstances in which individuals are born, or with which they live, that impact their health. Integrating SDoH into practice requires that information systems are able to identify SDoH-related concepts from charts and case notes through vocabularies or terminologies. Despite significant standardisation efforts across healthcare domains, SDoH coverage remains sparse in existing terminologies due to the broad spectrum of this domain, ranging from family relations, risk factors, to social programs and benefits, which are not consistently captured across administrative and clinical settings. This paper presents a framework to mine, evaluate and recommend new multidisciplinary concepts that relate to or impact the health and well-being of individuals using a word embedding model trained from a large dynamic corpus of unstructured data. Five key SDoH domains were selected and evaluated by domain experts. The concepts resulting from the trained model were matched against well-established meta-thesaurus UMLS and terminology SNOMED-CT and, overall, a significant proportion of concepts from a set of 10,000 candidates were not found (31% and 28% respectively). The results confirm both the gaps in current terminologies and the feasibility and impact of the methods presented in this paper for the incremental discovery and validation of new SDoH concepts together with domain experts. This sustainable approach facilitates the development and refinement of new and existing terminologies and, in turn, it allows systems such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) annotators to leverage SDoH concepts across integrated care settings.","['1 AI for Health & Social Care Research Group, IBM Research, Ireland.', '2 IBM Watson Health, Dublin, Ireland.', '3 NIHR Greater Manchester Patient Safety Translational Research Centre, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.']","Joao H Bettencourt-Silva, Natalia Mulligan, Marco Sbodio, John Segrave-Daly, Richard Williams, Vanessa Lopez, Carlos Alzate, ",Studies in health technology and informatics,2020,Social Determinants of Health; Terminologies; Vocabularies.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32570369

Using the ROUGE toolkit, we evaluate the summarizer against several methods previously described in literature. Results:
      
    

    
      The summarizer obtains state-of-the-art results and significantly improves the performance of biomedical text summarization in comparison to a set of domain-specific and domain-independent methods. The largest language model not specifically pretrained on biomedical text outperformed other models. However, among language models of the same size, the one further pretrained on biomedical text obtained best results. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We demonstrate that a hybrid system combining a deep bidirectional language model and a clustering method yields state-of-the-art results without requiring labor-intensive creation of annotated features or knowledge bases or computationally demanding domain-specific pretraining. This study provides a starting point towards investigating deep contextualized language models for biomedical text summarization.","['1 Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Decision Support, Center for Medical Statistics, Informatics, and Intelligent Systems, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.

569,A natural language-based tool for diagnosis of serrated polyposis syndrome,"Background and aims:
      
    

    
      Serrated polyposis syndrome (SPS) is common but under-recognized and is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. The diagnosis is based on the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria and is inclusive of the cumulative number of lifetime serrated polyps. We used natural language processing (NLP) to extract colonoscopy and pathology data from the electronic medical record (EMR). The aim of this study was to assess feasibility of using an NLP-based SPS tool to identify patients with SPS. Methods:
      
    

    
      NLP was used to extract data from 323,494 colonoscopies performed in 255,074 distinct patients between August 1998 and March 2016 to identify individuals who met SPS criteria. The accuracy of diagnosis of SPS was assessed by manual review of the EMR. Results:
      
    

    
      Of 255,074 patients, 71 were identified as meeting 1 WHO criteria for SPS. Manual review confirmed the diagnosis of SPS to be accurate in 66 cases (93%). Erroneous diagnosis in the remaining 5 cases occurred because of duplicate polyp data by NLP extraction. Only 25 of 66 patients (38%) were diagnosed with SPS by a clinician in the EMR. Of these, SPS was diagnosed by NLP at least 2 years before the clinician in 5 of 25 patients (20%). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      In a large cohort, NLP accurately identified SPS in over 90% of cases, most of which were not previously recognized. NLP can assist in collating colonoscopy and pathology data across multiple procedures in the same patient to make an accurate and earlier diagnosis of SPS.","['1 Department of Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.', '2 Center for Populations Health Research, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.', '3 Department of General Surgery, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.', '4 Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.']","Gopanandan Parthasarathy, Rocio Lopez, John McMichael, Carol A Burke, ",Gastrointestinal endoscopy,2020 Oct,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32417299
570,Integration of Neural Network-Based Symbolic Regression in Deep Learning for Scientific Discovery,"Symbolic regression is a powerful technique to discover analytic equations that describe data, which can lead to explainable models and the ability to predict unseen data. In contrast, neural networks have achieved amazing levels of accuracy on image recognition and natural language processing tasks, but they are often seen as black-box models that are difficult to interpret and typically extrapolate poorly. In this article, we use a neural network-based architecture for symbolic regression called the equation learner (EQL) network and integrate it with other deep learning architectures such that the whole system can be trained end-to-end through backpropagation. To demonstrate the power of such systems, we study their performance on several substantially different tasks. First, we show that the neural network can perform symbolic regression and learn the form of several functions. Next, we present an MNIST arithmetic task where a convolutional network extracts the digits. Finally, we demonstrate the prediction of dynamical systems where an unknown parameter is extracted through an encoder. We find that the EQL-based architecture can extrapolate quite well outside of the training data set compared with a standard neural network-based architecture, paving the way for deep learning to be applied in scientific exploration and discovery.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Samuel Kim, Peter Y Lu, Srijon Mukherjee, Michael Gilbert, Li Jing, Vladimir Ceperic, Marin Soljacic, ",IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32857704
571,Identifying Predictors of Suicide in Severe Mental Illness: A Feasibility Study of a Clinical Prediction Rule (Oxford Mental Illness and Suicide Tool or OxMIS),"Background:
      
    

    
      Oxford Mental Illness and Suicide tool (OxMIS) is a brief, scalable, freely available, structured risk assessment tool to assess suicide risk in patients with severe mental illness (schizophrenia-spectrum disorders or bipolar disorder). OxMIS requires further external validation, but a lack of large-scale cohorts with relevant variables makes this challenging. Electronic health records provide possible data sources for external validation of risk prediction tools. However, they contain large amounts of information within free-text that is not readily extractable. In this study, we examined the feasibility of identifying suicide predictors needed to validate OxMIS in routinely collected electronic health records. Methods:
      
    

    
      In study 1, we manually reviewed electronic health records of 57 patients with severe mental illness to calculate OxMIS risk scores. In study 2, we examined the feasibility of using natural language processing to scale up this process. We used anonymized free-text documents from the Clinical Record Interactive Search database to train a named entity recognition model, a machine learning technique which recognizes concepts in free-text. The model identified eight concepts relevant for suicide risk assessment: medication (antidepressant/antipsychotic treatment), violence, education, self-harm, benefits receipt, drug/alcohol use disorder, suicide, and psychiatric admission. We assessed model performance in terms of precision (similar to positive predictive value), recall (similar to sensitivity) and F1 statistic (an overall performance measure). Results:
      
    

    
      In study 1, we estimated suicide risk for all patients using the OxMIS calculator, giving a range of 12 month risk estimates from 0.1-3.4%. For 13 out of 17 predictors, there was no missing information in electronic health records. For the remaining 4 predictors missingness ranged from 7-26%; to account for these missing variables, it was possible for OxMIS to estimate suicide risk using a range of scores. In study 2, the named entity recognition model had an overall precision of 0.77, recall of 0.90 and F1 score of 0.83. The concept with the best precision and recall was medication (precision 0.84, recall 0.96) and the weakest were suicide (precision 0.37), and drug/alcohol use disorder (recall 0.61). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      It is feasible to estimate suicide risk with the OxMIS tool using predictors identified in routine clinical records. Predictors could be extracted using natural language processing. However, electronic health records differ from other data sources, particularly for family history variables, which creates methodological challenges.","['1 Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', '2 Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust, Warneford Hospital, Oxford, United Kingdom.']","Morwenna Senior, Matthias Burghart, Rongqin Yu, Andrey Kormilitzin, Qiang Liu, Nemanja Vaci, Alejo Nevado-Holgado, Smita Pandit, Jakov Zlodre, Seena Fazel, ",Frontiers in psychiatry,2020,OxMIS; bipolar disorder; electronic health records; feasibility; natural language processing; risk assessment; schizophrenia; suicide.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32351413
572,A Method for Generating Synthetic Electronic Medical Record Text,"Machine learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) have achieved remarkable success in many fields and have brought new opportunities and high expectation in the analyses of medical data, of which the most common type is the massive free-text electronic medical records (EMR). However, the free EMR texts are lacking consistent standards, rich of private information, and limited in availability. Also, it is often hard to have a balanced number of samples for the types of diseases under study. These problems hinder the development of ML and NLP methods for EMR data analysis. To tackle these problems, we developed a model called Medical Text Generative Adversarial Network or mtGAN, to generate synthetic EMR text. It is based on the GAN framework and is trained by the REINFORCE algorithm. It takes disease features as inputs and generates synthetic texts as EMRs for the corresponding diseases. We evaluate the model from micro-level, macro-level and application-level on a Chinese EMR text dataset. The results show that the method has a good capacity to fit real data and can generate realistic and diverse EMR samples. This provides a novel way to avoid potential leakage of patient privacy while still supply sufficient well-controlled cohort data for developing downstream ML and NLP methods.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Jiaqi Guan, Runzhe Li, Sheng Yu, Xuegong Zhang, ",IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31647443
573,Social language in autism spectrum disorder: A computational analysis of sentiment and linguistic abstraction,"Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) demonstrate impairments with pragmatic (social) language, including narrative skills and conversational abilities. We aimed to quantitatively characterize narrative performance in ASD using natural language processing techniques: sentiment and language abstraction analyses based on the Linguistic Category Model. Individuals with ASD and with typical development matched for age, gender, ethnicity, and verbal and nonverbal intelligence quotients produced language samples during two standardized tasks from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition assessment: Telling a Story from a Book and Description of a Picture. Only the narratives produced during the Book Task differed between ASD and control groups in terms of emotional polarity and language abstraction. Participants with typical development used words with positive sentiment more often in comparison to individuals with ASD. In the case of words with negative sentiment, the differences were marginally significant (participants with typical development used words with negative sentiment more often). The Book Task narratives of individuals with ASD were also characterized by a lower level of language abstraction than narratives of peers with typical development. Linguistic abstraction was strongly positively correlated with a higher number of words with emotional polarity. Neither linguistic abstraction nor emotional polarity correlated with participants' age or verbal and nonverbal IQ. The results support the promise of sentiment and language abstraction analyses as a useful tool for the quantitative, fully automated assessment of narrative abilities among individuals with ASD.","['1 Department of Health and Rehabilitation Psychology, Faculty of Psychology, University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', '2 The Linguistic Engineering Group, Institute of Computer Science Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, Poland.']","Izabela Chojnicka, Aleksander Wawer, ",PloS one,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32142537

575,Natural language processing and machine learning to enable automatic extraction and classification of patients' smoking status from electronic medical records,"Background:
      
    

    
      The electronic medical record (EMR) offers unique possibilities for clinical research, but some important patient attributes are not readily available due to its unstructured properties. We applied text mining using machine learning to enable automatic classification of unstructured information on smoking status from Swedish EMR data. Methods:
      
    

    
      Data on patients' smoking status from EMRs were used to develop 32 different predictive models that were trained using Weka, changing sentence frequency, classifier type, tokenization, and attribute selection in a database of 85,000 classified sentences. The models were evaluated using F-score and accuracy based on out-of-sample test data including 8500 sentences. The error weight matrix was used to select the best model, assigning a weight to each type of misclassification and applying it to the model confusion matrices. The best performing model was then compared to a rule-based method. Results:
      
    

    
      The best performing model was based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) classifier using a combination of unigrams and bigrams as tokens. Sentence frequency and attributes selection did not improve model performance. SMO achieved 98.14% accuracy and 0.981 F-score versus 79.32% and 0.756 for the rule-based model. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      A model using machine-learning algorithms to automatically classify patients' smoking status was successfully developed. Such algorithms may enable automatic assessment of smoking status and other unstructured data directly from EMRs without manual classification of complete case notes.","['1 Department of Learning, Informatics, Management and Ethics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', '2 IQVIA Solutions Sweden AB, Solna, Sweden.', '3 Department of Computer and Systems Sciences (DSV), Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden.']","Andrea Caccamisi, Leif Jørgensen, Hercules Dalianis, Mats Rosenlund, ",Upsala journal of medical sciences,2020,Clinical informatics; electronic medical records; machine learning; natural language processing; smoking; text mining.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32696698
576,"Applying citizen science to gene, drug and disease relationship extraction from biomedical abstracts","Motivation:
      
    

    
      Biomedical literature is growing at a rate that outpaces our ability to harness the knowledge contained therein. To mine valuable inferences from the large volume of literature, many researchers use information extraction algorithms to harvest information in biomedical texts. Information extraction is usually accomplished via a combination of manual expert curation and computational methods. Advances in computational methods usually depend on the time-consuming generation of gold standards by a limited number of expert curators. Citizen science is public participation in scientific research. We previously found that citizen scientists are willing and capable of performing named entity recognition of disease mentions in biomedical abstracts, but did not know if this was true with relationship extraction (RE). Results:
      
    

    
      In this article, we introduce the Relationship Extraction Module of the web-based application Mark2Cure (M2C) and demonstrate that citizen scientists can perform RE. We confirm the importance of accurate named entity recognition on user performance of RE and identify design issues that impacted data quality. We find that the data generated by citizen scientists can be used to identify relationship types not currently available in the M2C Relationship Extraction Module. We compare the citizen science-generated data with algorithm-mined data and identify ways in which the two approaches may complement one another. We also discuss opportunities for future improvement of this system, as well as the potential synergies between citizen science, manual biocuration and natural language processing.

577,Challenges of Developing a Natural Language Processing Method With Electronic Health Records to Identify Persons With Chronic Mobility Disability,"Objective:
      
    

    
      To assess the utility of applying natural language processing (NLP) to electronic health records (EHRs) to identify individuals with chronic mobility disability. Design:
      
    

    
      We used EHRs from the Research Patient Data Repository, which contains EHRs from a large Massachusetts health care delivery system. This analysis was part of a larger study assessing the effects of disability on diagnosis of colorectal cancer. We applied NLP text extraction software to longitudinal EHRs of colorectal cancer patients to identify persons who use a wheelchair (our indicator of mobility disability for this analysis). We manually reviewed the clinical notes identified by NLP using directed content analysis to identify true cases using wheelchairs, duration or chronicity of use, and documentation quality. Setting:
      
    

    
      EHRs from large health care delivery system PARTICIPANTS: Patients (N=14,877) 21-75 years old who were newly diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 2005 and 2017. Interventions:
      
    

    
      Not applicable. Main outcome measures:
      
    

    
      Confirmation of patients' chronic wheelchair use in NLP-flagged notes; quality of disability documentation. Results:
      
    

    
      We identified 14,877 patients with colorectal cancer with 303,182 associated clinical notes. NLP screening identified 1482 (0.5%) notes that contained 1+ wheelchair-associated keyword. These notes were associated with 420 patients (2.8% of colorectal cancer population). Of the 1482 notes, 286 (19.3%, representing 105 patients, 0.7% of the total) contained documentation of reason for wheelchair use and duration. Directed content analysis identified 3 themes concerning disability documentation: (1) wheelchair keywords used in specific EHR contexts; (2) reason for wheelchair not clearly stated; and (3) duration of wheelchair use not consistently documented. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      NLP offers an option to screen for patients with chronic mobility disability in much less time than required by manual chart review. Nonetheless, manual chart review must confirm that flagged patients have chronic mobility disability (are not false positives). Notes, however, often have inadequate disability documentation.","['1 Health Policy Research Center, Mongan Institute, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA.', ""2 Department of Psychosocial Oncology and Palliative Care, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA; Division of Palliative Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA."", '3 Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA; Division of Hematology and Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA.', '4 Division of General Internal Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA.', '5 Health Policy Research Center, Mongan Institute, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA; Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.

578,Adversarial active learning for the identification of medical concepts and annotation inconsistency,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Named entity recognition (NER) is a principal task in the biomedical field and deep learning-based algorithms have been widely applied to biomedical NER. However, all of these methods that are applied to biomedical corpora use only annotated samples to maximize their performances. Thus, (1) large numbers of unannotated samples are relinquished and their values are overlooked. (2) Compared with other types of active learning (AL) algorithms, generative adversarial learning (GAN)-based AL methods have developed slowly. Furthermore, current diversity-based AL methods only compute similarities between a pair of sentences and cannot evaluate distribution similarities between groups of sentences. Annotation inconsistency is one of the significant challenges in the biomedical annotation field. Most existing methods for addressing this challenge are statistics-based or rule-based methods. (3) They require sufficient expert knowledge and complex designs. To address challenges (1), (2), and (3) simultaneously, we propose innovative algorithms. Methods:
      
    

    
      GAN is introduced in this paper, and we propose the GAN-bidirectional long short-term memory-conditional random field (GAN-BiLSTM-CRF) and the GAN-bidirectional encoder representations from transformers-conditional random field (GAN-BERT-CRF) models, which can be considered an NER model, an AL model, and a model identifying error labels. BiLSTM-CRF or BERT-CRF is defined as the generator and a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based network is considered the discriminator. (1) The generator employs unannotated samples in addition to annotated samples to maximize NER performance. (2) The outputs of the CRF layer and the discriminator are used to select unlabeled samples for the AL task. (3) The discriminator discriminates the distribution of error labels from that of correct labels, identify error labels, and address the annotation inconsistency challenge. Results:
      
    

    
      The corpus from the 2010 i2b2/VA NLP challenge and the Chinese CCKS-2017 Task 2 dataset are adopted for experiments. Compared to the baseline BiLSTM-CRF and BERT-CRF, the GAN-BiLSTM-CRF and GAN-BERT-CRF models achieved significant improvements on the precision, recall, and F1 scores in terms of NER performance. Learning curves in AL experiments show the comparative results of the proposed models. Furthermore, the trained discriminator can identify samples with incorrect medical labels in both simulation and real-word experimental environments. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The idea of introducing GAN contributes significant results in terms of NER, active learning, and the ability to identify incorrect annotated samples. The benefits of GAN will be further studied.","[""1 Department of IT Center, the Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, China; National Clinical Research Center for Child Health, China.

      A significant amount of clinical information captured as free-text narratives could be better used for several applications, such as clinical decision support, ontology development, evidence-based practice, and research. The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) is specifically used for semantic comparisons for diagnostic purposes. All these functions require quality coverage of the domain of interest. The authors used natural language processing to capture craniofacial and oral phenotype signatures from electronic health records and then used these signatures for evaluation of existing oral phenotype ontology coverage. Methods:
      
    

    
      The authors applied a text-processing pipeline based on the clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System to annotate the clinical notes with Unified Medical Language System codes. The authors extracted the disease or disorder phenotype terms, which were then compared with HPO terms and their synonyms. Results:

581,Explainable Prediction of Medical Codes With Knowledge Graphs,"International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is an authoritative health care classification system of different diseases. It is widely used for disease and health records, assisted medical reimbursement decisions, and collecting morbidity and mortality statistics. The most existing ICD coding models only translate the simple diagnosis descriptions into ICD codes. And it obscures the reasons and details behind specific diagnoses. Besides, the label (code) distribution is uneven. And there is a dependency between labels. Based on the above considerations, the knowledge graph and attention mechanism were expanded into medical code prediction to improve interpretability. In this study, a new method called G_Coder was presented, which mainly consists of Multi-CNN, graph presentation, attentional matching, and adversarial learning. The medical knowledge graph was constructed by extracting entities related to ICD-9 from freebase. Ontology contains 5 entity classes, which are disease, symptom, medicine, surgery, and examination. The result of G_Coder on the MIMIC-III dataset showed that the micro-F1 score is 69.2% surpassing the state of art. The following conclusions can be obtained through the experiment: G_Coder integrates information across medical records using Multi-CNN and embeds knowledge into ICD codes. Adversarial learning is used to generate the adversarial samples to reconcile the writing styles of doctor. With the knowledge graph and attention mechanism, most relevant segments of medical codes can be explained. This suggests that the knowledge graph significantly improves the precision of code prediction and reduces the working pressure of the human coders.","['1 School of Information Science and Technology, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China.', ""2 The Third People's Hospital of Chengdu, Chengdu, China."", '3 School of Information Engineering, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, China.']","Fei Teng, Wei Yang, Li Chen, LuFei Huang, Qiang Xu, ",Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology,2020,automated ICD coding; explainable; knowledge graphs; medical records; natural language processing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32923430
582,Subtypes in patients with opioid misuse: A prognostic enrichment strategy using electronic health record data in hospitalized patients,"Background:
      
    

    
      Approaches are needed to better delineate the continuum of opioid misuse that occurs in hospitalized patients. A prognostic enrichment strategy with latent class analysis (LCA) may facilitate treatment strategies in subtypes of opioid misuse. We aim to identify subtypes of patients with opioid misuse and examine the distinctions between the subtypes by examining patient characteristics, topic models from clinical notes, and clinical outcomes. Methods:
      
    

    
      This was an observational study of inpatient hospitalizations at a tertiary care center between 2007 and 2017. Patients with opioid misuse were identified using an operational definition applied to all inpatient encounters. LCA with eight class-defining variables from the electronic health record (EHR) was applied to identify subtypes in the cohort of patients with opioid misuse. Comparisons between subtypes were made using the following approaches: (1) descriptive statistics on patient characteristics and healthcare utilization using EHR data and census-level data; (2) topic models with natural language processing (NLP) from clinical notes; (3) association with hospital outcomes. Findings:
      
    

    
      The analysis cohort was 6,224 (2.7% of all hospitalizations) patient encounters with opioid misuse with a data corpus of 422,147 clinical notes. LCA identified four subtypes with differing patient characteristics, topics from the clinical notes, and hospital outcomes. Class 1 was categorized by high hospital utilization with known opioid-related conditions (36.5%); Class 2 included patients with illicit use, low socioeconomic status, and psychoses (12.8%); Class 3 contained patients with alcohol use disorders with complications (39.2%); and class 4 consisted of those with low hospital utilization and incidental opioid misuse (11.5%). The following hospital outcomes were the highest for each subtype when compared against the other subtypes: readmission for class 1 (13.9% vs. 10.5%, p<0.01); discharge against medical advice for class 2 (12.3% vs. 5.3%, p<0.01); and in-hospital death for classes 3 and 4 (3.2% vs. 1.9%, p<0.01). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      A 4-class latent model was the most parsimonious model that defined clinically interpretable and relevant subtypes for opioid misuse. Distinct subtypes were delineated after examining multiple domains of EHR data and applying methods in artificial intelligence. The approach with LCA and readily available class-defining substance use variables from the EHR may be applied as a prognostic enrichment strategy for targeted interventions.","['1 Department of Public Health Sciences, Loyola University, Maywood, Illinois, United States of America.', '2 Center for Health Outcomes and Informatics Research, Loyola University, Maywood, Illinois, United States of America.', '3 Stritch School of Medicine, Loyola University, Maywood, Illinois, United States of America.', '4 Department of Computer Science, Loyola University Medical Center, Maywood, Illinois, United States of America.', '5 Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Loyola University, Chicago, Illinois, United States of America.', '6 Center for Multi-System Solutions to the Opioid Epidemic, American Institute for Research, Chicago, Illinois, United States of America.', '7 Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, United States of America.']","Majid Afshar, Cara Joyce, Dmitriy Dligach, Brihat Sharma, Robert Kania, Meng Xie, Kristin Swope, Elizabeth Salisbury-Afshar, Niranjan S Karnik, ",PloS one,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31310611
583,Identification and Characterization of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by substantial diagnostic and evaluation gaps with no systematic screening. Even recognized cases are undercoded because of the perceived benign nature of disease and current absence of approved pharmacologic treatment. NAFLD is often detected incidentally, particularly in the asymptomatic early phase. We doubled NAFLD detection via natural language processing of 1 million imaging reports combined with laboratory data from an unselected population. We describe NAFLD comorbidities and health care utilization as compared with age, sex, and body mass index matched control subjects.","['1 Maccabitech Institute for Research and Innovation, Maccabi Healthcare Services, Tel Aviv, Israel.

584,Automatic Annotation of Narrative Radiology Reports,"Narrative texts in electronic health records can be efficiently utilized for building decision support systems in the clinic, only if they are correctly interpreted automatically in accordance with a specified standard. This paper tackles the problem of developing an automated method of labeling free-form radiology reports, as a precursor for building query-capable report databases in hospitals. The analyzed dataset consists of 1295 radiology reports concerning the condition of a knee, retrospectively gathered at the Clinical Hospital Centre Rijeka, Croatia. Reports were manually labeled with one or more labels from a set of 10 most commonly occurring clinical conditions. After primary preprocessing of the texts, two sets of text classification methods were compared: (1) traditional classification models-Naive Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forests (RF)-coupled with Bag-of-Words (BoW) features (i.e., symbolic text representation) and (2) Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) coupled with dense word vectors (i.e., word embeddings as a semantic text representation) as input features. We resorted to nested 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate the performance of competing methods using accuracy, precision, recall, and F 1 score. The CNN with semantic word representations as input yielded the overall best performance, having a micro-averaged F 1 score of 86 . 7 % . The CNN classifier yielded particularly encouraging results for the most represented conditions: degenerative disease ( 95 . 9 % ), arthrosis ( 93 . 3 % ), and injury ( 89 . 2 % ). As a data-hungry deep learning model, the CNN, however, performed notably worse than the competing models on underrepresented classes with fewer training instances such as multicausal disease or metabolic disease. LR, RF, and SVM performed comparably well, with the obtained micro-averaged F 1 scores of 84 . 6 % , 82 . 2 % , and 82 . 1 % , respectively.","['1 Department of Computer Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Rijeka, Vukovarska 58, 51000 Rijeka, Croatia.', '2 School of Business Informatics and Mathematics, University of Mannheim, 68159 Mannheim, Germany.', '3 Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Zagreb, Heinzelova 55, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia.', '4 Clinical Hospital Centre Rijeka, University of Rijeka, Krešimirova 42, 51000 Rijeka, Croatia.', '5 Center for Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity, University of Rijeka, Radmile Matejčić 2, 51000 Rijeka, Croatia.']","Ivan Krsnik, Goran Glavaš, Marina Krsnik, Damir Miletić, Ivan Štajduhar, ","Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)",2020,automatic labeling; decision support system; free-form radiology report; knee; machine learning; natural language processing; word embedding.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32244833

We developed a novel method using Word2Vec, Levenshtein edit distance constraints, and a customized lexicon to identify correct and misspelled pharmaceutical word forms. We processed a large corpus of clinical notes in a real-world pharmacovigilance task, achieving positive predictive values of 0.929 and 0.909 in identifying valid misspellings and correct spellings, respectively, and negative predictive values of 0.994 and 0.333 as assessments where the program did not produce output. In a specific Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus use case, the method identified 9,815 additional instances in the corpus for potential inaffective drug administration inspection.

      A structured search of the current literature was performed (up to and including September 2018). Search terms related to topics of AI in otolaryngology were identified and queried to identify relevant articles. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      AI is at the forefront of conversation in academic research and popular culture. In recent years, it has been touted for its potential to revolutionize health care delivery. Yet, to date, it has made few contributions to actual medical practice or patient care. Future adoption of AI technologies in otolaryngology practice may be hindered by misconceptions of what AI is and a fear that machine errors may compromise patient care. However, with potential clinical and economic benefits, it is vital for otolaryngologists to understand the principles and scope of AI. Implications for practice:
      
    

    
      In the coming years, AI is likely to have a major impact on biomedical research and the practice of medicine. Otolaryngologists are key stakeholders in the development and clinical integration of meaningful AI technologies that will improve patient care. High-quality data collection is essential for the development of AI technologies, and otolaryngologists should seek opportunities to collaborate with data scientists to guide them toward the most impactful clinical questions.","['1 1 Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, University of Kansas, Kansas City, Kansas, USA.', '2 2 School of Medicine, University of Kansas, Kansas City, Kansas, USA.']","Andrés M Bur, Matthew Shew, Jacob New, ",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,2019 Apr,artificial intelligence; machine learning; natural language processing; otolaryngology practice.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30717624
588,EUSKOR: End-to-end coreference resolution system for Basque,"This paper describes the process of adapting the Stanford Coreference resolution module to the Basque language, taking into account the characteristics of the language. The module has been integrated in a linguistic analysis pipeline obtaining an end-to-end coreference resolution system for the Basque language. The adaptation process explained can benefit and facilitate other languages with similar characteristics in the implementation of their coreference resolution systems. During the experimentation phase, we have demonstrated that language-specific features have a noteworthy effect on coreference resolution, obtaining a gain in CoNLL score of 7.07 with respect to the baseline system. We have also analysed the effect that preprocessing has in coreference resolution, comparing the results obtained with automatic mentions versus gold mentions. When gold mentions are provided, the results increase 11.5 points in CoNLL score in comparison with results obtained when automatic mentions are used. The contribution of each sieve is analysed concluding that morphology is essential for agglutinative languages to obtain good performance in coreference resolution. Finally, an error analysis of the coreference resolution system is presented which have revealed our system's weak points and help to determine the improvements of the system. As a result of the error analysis, we have enriched the Basque coreference resolution adding new two sieves, obtaining an improvement of 0.24 points in CoNLL F1 when automatic mentions are used and of 0.39 points when the gold mentions are provided.","['1 Computer Languages and Systems Department, University of the Basque Country, Donostia-San Sebastian, Spain.', '2 Computer Architecture and Technology Department, University of the Basque Country, Donostia-San Sebastian, Spain.']","Ander Soraluze, Olatz Arregi, Xabier Arregi, Arantza Díaz de Ilarraza, ",PloS one,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31513627
589,The influence of preprocessing on text classification using a bag-of-words representation,"Text classification (TC) is the task of automatically assigning documents to a fixed number of categories. TC is an important component in many text applications. Many of these applications perform preprocessing. There are different types of text preprocessing, e.g., conversion of uppercase letters into lowercase letters, HTML tag removal, stopword removal, punctuation mark removal, lemmatization, correction of common misspelled words, and reduction of replicated characters. We hypothesize that the application of different combinations of preprocessing methods can improve TC results. Therefore, we performed an extensive and systematic set of TC experiments (and this is our main research contribution) to explore the impact of all possible combinations of five/six basic preprocessing methods on four benchmark text corpora (and not samples of them) using three ML methods and training and test sets. The general conclusion (at least for the datasets verified) is that it is always advisable to perform an extensive and systematic variety of preprocessing methods combined with TC experiments because it contributes to improve TC accuracy. For all the tested datasets, there was always at least one combination of basic preprocessing methods that could be recommended to significantly improve the TC using a BOW representation. For three datasets, stopword removal was the only single preprocessing method that enabled a significant improvement compared to the baseline result using a bag of 1,000-word unigrams. For some of the datasets, there was minimal improvement when we removed HTML tags, performed spelling correction or removed punctuation marks, and reduced replicated characters. However, for the fourth dataset, the stopword removal was not beneficial. Instead, the conversion of uppercase letters into lowercase letters was the only single preprocessing method that demonstrated a significant improvement compared to the baseline result. The best result for this dataset was obtained when we performed spelling correction and conversion into lowercase letters. In general, for all the datasets processed, there was always at least one combination of basic preprocessing methods that could be recommended to improve the accuracy results when using a bag-of-words representation.","['1 Dept. of Computer Science, Jerusalem College of Technology - Lev Academic Center, Jerusalem, Israel.']","Yaakov HaCohen-Kerner, Daniel Miller, Yair Yigal, ",PloS one,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32357164
590,Optic Disc and Cup Image Segmentation Utilizing Contour-Based Transformation and Sequence Labeling Networks,"Optic disc (OD) and optic cup (OC) segmentation are important steps for automatic screening and diagnosing of optic nerve head abnormalities such as glaucoma. Many recent works formulated the OD and OC segmentation as a pixel classification task. However, it is hard for these methods to explicitly model the spatial relations between the labels in the output mask. Furthermore, the proportion of the background, OD and OC are unbalanced which also may result in a biased model as well as introduce more noise. To address these problems, we developed an approach that follows a coarse-to-fine segmentation process. We start with a U-Net to obtain a rough segmenting boundary and then crop the area around the boundary to form a boundary contour centered image. Second, inspired by sequence labeling tasks in natural language processing, we regard the OD and OC segmentation as a sequence labeling task and propose a novel fully convolutional network called SU-Net and combine it with the Viterbi algorithm to jointly decode the segmentation boundary. We also introduced a geometric parameter-based data augmentation method to generate more training samples in order to minimize the differences between training and test sets and reduce overfitting. Experimental results show that our method achieved state-of-the-art results on 2 datasets for both OD and OC segmentation and our method outperforms most of the ophthalmologists in terms of achieving agreement out of 6 ophthalmologists on the MESSIDOR dataset for both OD and OC segmentation. In terms of glaucoma screening, we achieved the best cup-to-disc ratio (CDR) error and area under the ROC curve (AUC) for glaucoma classification on the Drishti-GS dataset.","['1 Laboratory for Medical Imaging Informatics, Shanghai Institute of Technical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 200083, China.', '2 Laboratory for Medical Imaging Informatics, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China.', '3 Department of Biomedical Engineering, Image Processing and Informatics Laboratory, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, 90089, USA. brentliu@usc.edu.']","Zhe Xie, Tonghui Ling, Yuanyuan Yang, Rong Shu, Brent J Liu, ",Journal of medical systems,2020,Convolutional neural networks; Fundus image; Glaucoma screening; Optic disc segmentation; Sequence labeling; Viterbi decoding.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32193703
591,NLP-Based Approach for Predicting HMI State Sequences Towards Monitoring Operator Situational Awareness,"A novel approach presented herein transforms the Human Machine Interface (HMI) states, as a pattern of visual feedback states that encompass both operator actions and process states, from a multi-variate time-series to a natural language processing (NLP) modeling domain. The goal of this approach is to predict operator response patterns for n - a h e a d time-step window given k - l a g g e d past HMI state patterns. The NLP approach offers the possibility of encoding (semantic) contextual relations within HMI state patterns. Towards which, a technique for framing raw HMI data for supervised training using sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) deep-learning machine translation algorithms is presented. In addition, a custom Seq2Seq convolutional neural network (CNN) NLP model based on current state-of-the-art design elements such as attention, is compared against a standard recurrent neural network (RNN) based NLP model. Results demonstrate comparable effectiveness of both the designs of NLP models evaluated for modeling HMI states. RNN NLP models showed higher ( ≈ 26 % ) forecast accuracy, in general for both in-sample and out-of-sample test datasets. However, custom CNN NLP model showed higher ( ≈ 53 % ) validation accuracy indicative of less over-fitting with the same amount of available training data. The real-world application of the proposed NLP modeling of industrial HMIs, such as in power generating stations control rooms, aviation (cockpits), and so forth, is towards the realization of a non-intrusive operator situational awareness monitoring framework through prediction of HMI states.","['1 Department of Electrical, Computer and Software Engineering, Ontario Tech University, Oshawa, ON L1G 0C5, Canada.', '2 Computers, Controls and Design Department, Ontario Power Generation, Pickering, ON L1W 3J2, Canada.']","Harsh V P Singh, Qusay H Mahmoud, ","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2020,Human Machine Interface (HMI); human-in-the-loop (HITL); natural language processing (NLP); sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq); situational awareness (SA).,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32517145
592,Automated extraction of ophthalmic surgery outcomes from the electronic health record,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Comprehensive analysis of ophthalmic surgical outcomes is often restricted by limited methodologies for efficiently and accurately extracting clinical information from electronic health record (EHR) systems because much is in free-text form. This study aims to utilize advanced methods to automate extraction of clinical concepts from the EHR free text to study visual acuity (VA), intraocular pressure (IOP), and medication outcomes of cataract and glaucoma surgeries. Methods:
      
    

    
      Patients who underwent cataract or glaucoma surgery at an academic medical center between 2009 and 2018 were identified by Current Procedural Terminology codes. Rule-based algorithms were developed and used on EHR clinical narrative text to extract intraocular lens (IOL) power and implant type, as well as to create a surgery laterality classifier. MedEx (version 1.3.7) was used on free-text clinical notes to extract information on eye medications and compared to information from medication orders. Random samples of free-text notes were reviewed by two independent masked annotators to assess inter-annotator agreement on outcome variable classification and accuracy of classifiers. VA and IOP were available from semi-structured fields. Results:
      
    

    
      This study cohort included 6347 unique patients, with 8550 stand-alone cataract surgeries, 451 combined cataract/glaucoma surgeries, and 961 glaucoma surgeries without concurrent cataract surgery. The rule-based laterality classifier achieved 100% accuracy compared to manual review of a sample of operative notes by independent masked annotators. For cataract surgery alone, glaucoma surgery alone, or combined cataract/glaucoma surgeries, our automated extraction algorithm achieved 99-100% accuracy compared to manual annotation of samples of notes from each group, including IOL model and IOL power for cataract surgeries, and glaucoma implant for glaucoma surgeries. For glaucoma medications, there was 90.7% inter-annotator agreement. After adjudication, 85.0% of medications identified by MedEx determined to be correct. Determination of surgical laterality enabled evaluation of pre- and postoperative VA and IOP for operative eyes. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      This text-processing pipeline can accurately capture surgical laterality and implant model usage from free-text operative notes of cataract and glaucoma surgeries, enabling extraction of clinical outcomes including visual acuities, intraocular pressure, and medications from the EHR system. Use of this approach with EHRs to assess ophthalmic surgical outcomes can benefit research groups interested in studying the safety and clinical efficacies of different surgical approaches.","['1 Byers Eye Institute, Stanford University, 2452 Watson Ct, Palo Alto, CA, 94303, USA.

These relationships exist in the biomedical literature, however they are not directly available and have to be extracted from the text. Existing, automated biomedical relationship extraction methods tend to be narrow in scope, e.g., protein-protein interactions, and pertain to intra-sentence relationships. The proposed approach targets intra and inter-sentence, disorder-centric relationship extraction. It employs an LSTM deep learning model that utilises a novel, sequential feature set, including medical concept embeddings. The LSTM model outperforms rule based and co-occurrence models by at least +78% in F1 score, suggesting that inter-sentence relationships are an important subset of all disorder-centric relations and that our approach shows promise for inter-sentence relationship extraction in this and possibly other domains.","['1 The University of Queensland, St Lucia, Qld, Australia.']","Anton H van der Vegt, Guido Zuccon, Bevan Koopman, ",AMIA ...

594,Natural Language Processing Reveals Vulnerable Mental Health Support Groups and Heightened Health Anxiety on Reddit during COVID-19: An Observational Study,"Background:
      
    

    
      The COVID-19 pandemic is exerting a devastating impact on mental health, but it is not clear how people with different types of mental health problems were differentially impacted as the initial wave of cases hit. Objective:
      
    

    
      We leverage natural language processing (NLP) with the goal of characterizing changes in fifteen of the world's largest mental health support groups (e.g., r/schizophrenia, r/SuicideWatch, r/Depression) found on the website Reddit, along with eleven non-mental health groups (e.g., r/PersonalFinance, r/conspiracy) during the initial stage of the pandemic. Methods:
      
    

    
      We create and release the Reddit Mental Health Dataset including posts from 826,961 unique users from 2018 to 2020. Using regression, we analyze trends from 90 text-derived features such as sentiment analysis, personal pronouns, and a ""guns"" semantic category. Using supervised machine learning, we classify posts into their respective support group and interpret important features to understand how different problems manifest in language. We apply unsupervised methods such as topic modeling and unsupervised clustering to uncover concerns throughout Reddit before and during the pandemic. Results:
      
    

    
      We find that the r/HealthAnxiety forum showed spikes in posts about COVID-19 early on in January, approximately two months before other support groups started posting about the pandemic. There were many features that significantly increased during COVID-19 for specific groups including the categories ""economic stress"", ""isolation"", and ""home"" while others such as ""motion"" significantly decreased. We find that support groups related to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), eating disorders (ED), and anxiety showed the most negative semantic change during the pandemic out of all mental health groups. Health anxiety emerged as a general theme across Reddit through independent supervised and unsupervised machine learning analyses. For instance, we provide evidence that the concerns of a diverse set of individuals are converging in this unique moment of history; we discover that the more users posted about COVID-19, the more linguistically similar (less distant) the mental health support groups became to r/HealthAnxiety (ρ = -0.96, P<.001). Using unsupervised clustering, we find the Suicidality and Loneliness clusters more than doubled in amount of posts during the pandemic. Specifically, the support groups for borderline personality disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder became significantly associated with the Suicidality cluster. Furthermore, clusters surrounding Self-Harm and Entertainment emerged. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      By using a broad set of NLP techniques and analyzing a baseline of pre-pandemic posts, we uncover patterns of how specific mental health problems manifest in language, identify at-risk users, and reveal the distribution of concerns across Reddit which could help provide better resources to its millions of users. We then demonstrate that textual analysis is sensitive to uncover mental health complaints as they arise in real time, identifying vulnerable groups and alarming themes during COVID-19, and thus may have utility during the ongoing pandemic and other world-changing events such as elections and protests from the present or the past.","['1 Program in Speech and Hearing Bioscience and Technology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, US.', '2 Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, MIT, 43 Vassar St, Cambridge, US.', '3 McGovern Institute for Brain Research, MIT, Cambridge, US.', '4 Program in Biomedical Informatics and Integrative Genomics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, US.', ""5 Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, US."", '6 Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, US.', '7 Human Health and Performance Systems, MIT Lincoln Laboratory, Lexington, US.', '8 Digital Psychiatry Division, Department of Psychiatry at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, US.', '9 Thomas J.

595,A Method to Extract Causality for Safety Events in Chemical Accidents from Fault Trees and Accident Reports,"Chemical event evolutionary graph (CEEG) is an effective tool to perform safety analysis, early warning, and emergency disposal for chemical accidents. However, it is a complicated work to find causality among events in a CEEG. This paper presents a method to accurately extract event causality by using a neural network and structural analysis. First, we identify the events and their component elements from fault trees by natural language processing technology. Then, causality in accident events is divided into explicit causality and implicit causality. Explicit causality is obtained by analyzing the hierarchical structure relations of event nodes and the semantics of component logic gates in fault trees. By integrating internal structural features of events and semantic features of event sentences, we extract implicit causality by utilizing a bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU) neural network. An algorithm, named CEFTAR, is presented to extract causality for safety events in chemical accidents from fault trees and accident reports. Compared with the existing methods, experimental results show that our method has a higher accuracy and recall rate in extracting causality.","['1 School of Information Science and Technology, Qingdao University of Science and Technology, Qicngdao 266061, China.']","Junwei Du, Hanrui Zhao, Yangyang Yu, Qiang Hu, ",Computational intelligence and neuroscience,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32788919
596,Finding warning markers: Leveraging natural language processing and machine learning technologies to detect risk of school violence,"Introduction:
      
    

    
      School violence has a far-reaching effect, impacting the entire school population including staff, students and their families. Among youth attending the most violent schools, studies have reported higher dropout rates, poor school attendance, and poor scholastic achievement. It was noted that the largest crime-prevention results occurred when youth at elevated risk were given an individualized prevention program. However, much work is needed to establish an effective approach to identify at-risk subjects. Objective:
      
    

    
      In our earlier research, we developed a risk assessment program to interview subjects, identify risk and protective factors, and evaluate risk for school violence. This study focused on developing natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning technologies to automate the risk assessment process. Material and methods:
      
    

    
      We prospectively recruited 131 students with or without behavioral concerns from 89 schools between 05/01/2015 and 04/30/2018. The subjects were interviewed with two risk assessment scales and a questionnaire, and their risk of violence were determined by pediatric psychiatrists based on clinical judgment. Using NLP technologies, different types of linguistic features were extracted from the interview content. Machine learning classifiers were then applied to predict risk of school violence for individual subjects. A two-stage feature selection was implemented to identify violence-related predictors. The performance was validated on the psychiatrist-generated reference standard of risk levels, where positive predictive value (PPV), sensitivity (SEN), negative predictive value (NPV), specificity (SPEC) and area under the ROC curve (AUC) were assessed. Results:
      
    

    
      Compared to subjects' sociodemographic information, use of linguistic features significantly improved classifiers' predictive performance (P < 0.01). The best-performing classifier with n-gram features achieved 86.5 %/86.5 %/85.7 %/85.7 %/94.0 % (PPV/SEN/NPV/SPEC/AUC) on the cross-validation set and 83.3 %/93.8 %/91.7 %/78.6 %/94.6 % (PPV/SEN/NPV/SPEC/AUC) on the test data. The feature selection process identified a set of predictors covering the discussion of subjects' thoughts, perspectives, behaviors, individual characteristics, peers and family dynamics, and protective factors. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      By analyzing the content from subject interviews, the NLP and machine learning algorithms showed good capacity for detecting risk of school violence.

597,Improving the Efficacy of the Data Entry Process for Clinical Research With a Natural Language Processing-Driven Medical Information Extraction System: Quantitative Field Research,"Background:
      
    

    
      The growing interest in observational trials using patient data from electronic medical records poses challenges to both efficiency and quality of clinical data collection and management. Even with the help of electronic data capture systems and electronic case report forms (eCRFs), the manual data entry process followed by chart review is still time consuming. Objective:
      
    

    
      To facilitate the data entry process, we developed a natural language processing-driven medical information extraction system (NLP-MIES) based on the i2b2 reference standard. We aimed to evaluate whether the NLP-MIES-based eCRF application could improve the accuracy and efficiency of the data entry process. Methods:
      
    

    
      We conducted a randomized and controlled field experiment, and 24 eligible participants were recruited (12 for the manual group and 12 for NLP-MIES-supported group). We simulated the real-world eCRF completion process using our system and compared the performance of data entry on two research topics, pediatric congenital heart disease and pneumonia. Results:
      
    

    
      For the congenital heart disease condition, the NLP-MIES-supported group increased accuracy by 15% (95% CI 4%-120%, P=.03) and reduced elapsed time by 33% (95% CI 22%-42%, P<.001) compared with the manual group. For the pneumonia condition, the NLP-MIES-supported group increased accuracy by 18% (95% CI 6%-32%, P=.008) and reduced elapsed time by 31% (95% CI 19%-41%, P<.001). Conclusions:

599,Determining Follow-Up Imaging Study Using Radiology Reports,"Radiology reports often contain follow-up imaging recommendations. Failure to comply with these recommendations in a timely manner can lead to delayed treatment, poor patient outcomes, complications, unnecessary testing, lost revenue, and legal liability. The objective of this study was to develop a scalable approach to automatically identify the completion of a follow-up imaging study recommended by a radiologist in a preceding report. We selected imaging-reports containing 559 follow-up imaging recommendations and all subsequent reports from a multi-hospital academic practice. Three radiologists identified appropriate follow-up examinations among the subsequent reports for the same patient, if any, to establish a ground-truth dataset. We then trained an Extremely Randomized Trees that uses recommendation attributes, study meta-data and text similarity of the radiology reports to determine the most likely follow-up examination for a preceding recommendation. Pairwise inter-annotator F-score ranged from 0.853 to 0.868; the corresponding F-score of the classifier in identifying follow-up exams was 0.807. Our study describes a methodology to automatically determine the most likely follow-up exam after a follow-up imaging recommendation. The accuracy of the algorithm suggests that automated methods can be integrated into a follow-up management application to improve adherence to follow-up imaging recommendations. Radiology administrators could use such a system to monitor follow-up compliance rates and proactively send reminders to primary care providers and/or patients to improve adherence.","['1 Clinical Informatics Solutions and Services, Philips Research North America, 2 Canal Park, Cambridge, MA, 02141, USA.', '2 Clinical Informatics Solutions and Services, Philips Research North America, 2 Canal Park, Cambridge, MA, 02141, USA. vadiraj.hombal@philips.com.', '3 Department of Biomedical Informatics, Harvard Medical School, 10 Shattuck Street, Boston, MA, 02115, USA.', '4 Radiology Solutions, Philips Healthcare, 22100 Bothell Everett Highway, Bothell, WA, 98021, USA.', '5 Department of Radiology, University of Washington, 1959 NE Pacific Street, Seattle, WA, 98195, USA.']","Sandeep Dalal, Vadiraj Hombal, Wei-Hung Weng, Gabe Mankovich, Thusitha Mabotuwana, Christopher S Hall, Joseph Fuller 3rd, Bruce E Lehnert, Martin L Gunn, ",Journal of digital imaging,2020 Feb,Follow-up studies; Medical informatics applications; Natural language processing; Radiology; Supervised machine learning.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31452006
600,SMART on FHIR in spine: integrating clinical prediction models into electronic health records for precision medicine at the point of care,"Recent applications of artificial intelligence have shown great promise for improving the quality and efficiency of clinical care. Numerous clinical decision support tools exist in today's electronic health records (EHRs) such as medication dosing support, order facilitators (eg, procedure specific order sets), and point of care alerts. However, less has been done to integrate artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled risk predictors into EHRs despite wide availability of validated risk prediction tools. An interoperability standard known as SMART on FHIR (substitutable medical applications and reusable technologies on fast health interoperability resources) offers a promising path forward, enabling digital innovations to be seamlessly integrated with the EHR with regard to the user interface and patient data. For the next step in progress towards the goal of learning healthcare and informatics-enabled spine surgery, we propose the application of SMART on FHIR to integrate existing and new risk predictions tools in spine surgery through an EHR add-on-application.","['1 Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 55 Fruit St, Boston, MA 02114, USA.

In this paper, we focus on scientific keyphrase extraction, which aims to identify keyphrases from scientific articles and classify them into predefined categories. We present a neural network based approach for this task, which employs the bidirectional long short-memory (LSTM) to represent the sentences in the article. On top of the bidirectional LSTM layer in our neural model, conditional random field (CRF) is used to predict the label sequence for the whole sentence. Considering the expensive annotated data for supervised learning methods, we introduce self-training method into our neural model to leverage the unlabeled articles. Experimental results on the ScienceIE corpus and ACL keyphrase corpus show that our neural model achieves promising performance without any hand-designed features and external knowledge resources. Furthermore, it efficiently incorporates the unlabeled data and achieve competitive performance compared with previous state-of-the-art systems.","['1 Key Laboratory of Aerospace Information Security and Trusted Computing, Ministry of Education, School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', '2 School of Mathematics and Computer Science, Jianghan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', '3 Laboratory of Language and Artificial Intelligence, Guangdong University of Foreign Studies, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', '4 Collaborative Innovation Center for Language Research and Services, Guangdong University of Foreign Studies, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.']","Xun Zhu, Chen Lyu, Donghong Ji, Han Liao, Fei Li, ",PloS one,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32413094
602,Matching patients to clinical trials using semantically enriched document representation,"Recruiting eligible patients for clinical trials is crucial for reliably answering specific questions about medical interventions and evaluation. However, clinical trial recruitment is a bottleneck in clinical research and drug development. Our goal is to provide an approach towards automating this manual and time-consuming patient recruitment task using natural language processing and machine learning techniques. Specifically, our approach extracts key information from series of narrative clinical documents in patient's records and collates helpful evidence to make decisions on eligibility of patients according to certain inclusion and exclusion criteria. Challenges in applying narrative clinical documents such as differences in reporting styles and sub-languages are addressed by enriching them with knowledge from domain ontologies in the form of semantic vector representations. We show that a machine learning model based on Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) is more effective for the task than five other neural networks and four conventional machine learning models. Our approach achieves overall micro-F1-Score of 84% for 13 different eligibility criteria. Our experiments also indicate that semantically enriched documents are more effective than using original documents for cohort selection. Our system provides an end-to-end machine learning-based solution that achieves comparable results with the state-of-the-art which relies on hand-crafted rules or data-centric engineered features.","['1 CSIRO The Australian e-Health Research Centre, Brisbane, Australia.

      Cancer testis (CT) antigens are promising targets for cancer immunotherapies such as cancer vaccines and genetically modified adoptive T cell therapy. In this study, we evaluated the expression of three CT antigens, melanoma-associated antigen A4 (MAGE-A4), New York oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma 1 (NY-ESO-1) and sarcoma antigen gene (SAGE). Methods:
      
    

    
      MAGE-A4, NY-ESO-1 and/or SAGE antigen expression in tumour samples was evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Informed consent was obtained from individuals prior to study enrolment. Results:
      
    

    
      In total, 585 samples in 21 tumour types were evaluated between June 2009 and March 2018. The positive expression rates of these CT antigens were as follows: MAGE-A4, 34.6% (range, 30.7-38.7); NY-ESO-1, 21.0% (range, 17.2-25.1); and SAGE, 21.8% (range, 18.5-25.4). The MAGE-A4 antigen was expressed in 54.9% of oesophageal cancers, 37.5% of head and neck cancers, 35.0% of gastric cancers and 34.2% of ovarian cancers; the NY-ESO-1 antigen was expressed in 28.6% of lung cancers, 25.3% of oesophageal cancers and 22.6% of ovarian cancers; and the SAGE antigen was expressed in 35.3% of prostate cancers, 32.9% of oesophageal cancers and 26.3% of ovarian cancers. The most common tumour type in this study was oesophageal cancer. MAGE-A4, NY-ESO-1 and SAGE antigen expression were assessed in 214 oesophageal cancer samples, among which 24 (11.2%) were triple-positive, 58 (27.1%) were positive for any two, 59 (27.6%) were positive for any one, and 73 (34.1%) were triple negative.

605,Emergency department disposition prediction using a deep neural network with integrated clinical narratives and structured data,"Background:
      
    

    
      Emergency department (ED) overcrowding has been a serious issue and demands effective clinical decision-making of patient disposition. In previous studies, emergency clinical narratives provide a rich context for clinical decisions. We aimed to develop the disposition prediction model using deep learning modeling strategy with the heterogeneous data, including the physicians' narratives. Methods:
      
    

    
      We constructed a retrospective cohort of all 104,083 ED visits of non-trauma adults during 2017-18 from an academically affiliated ED in Taiwan. 18,308 visits were excluded based on the completeness of each record and the unpredictable dispositions, such as out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, against-advice discharge, and escapes. We integrated subjective section of the first physicians' clinical narratives and structured data (e.g., demographics, triage vital signs, etc.) as available predictors at the first physician-patient encounter. To predict final patient disposition (i.e., hospitalization or discharge), a deep neural network (DNN) model was developed with word embedding, a common natural language processing method. We compared the proposed model to a reference model using the Rapid Emergency Medicine Score, a logistic regression model with structured data, and a DNN model with paragraph vectors. F1 score was used to measure the predictive performance for each model. Results:
      
    

    
      The F1 score (with 95 % CI) for the proposed model, the reference model, the logistic regression model with structured data, and the DNN model with paragraph vectors were 0.674 (0.669-0.679), 0.474 (0.469-0.479), 0.547 (0.543-0.551), and 0.602 (0.596-0.607), respectively. While analyzing the relationship between context length and predictive performance under the proposed model, the F1 score at 95th percentile of the word counts was higher than that at 25th percentile of the word counts in chief complaint [0.634 (0.629-0.640) vs. 0.624 (0.620-0.628)] and in present illness [0.671 (0.667-0.674) vs. 0.654 (0.651-0.658)], but not in past medical history [0.674 (0.669-0.679) vs. 0.673 (0.666-0.679)]. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The proposed deep learning model with the usage of the first physicians' clinical narratives and structured data based on natural language processing outperformed the commonly used ones in terms of F1 score. It also evidenced the importance of the subjective section of clinical narratives, which serve as vital predictors for ED clinical decision-making.","['1 Department of Electrical Engineering, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Department of Emergency Medicine, Taichung Veterans General Hospital Chiayi Branch, Chia-Yi, Taiwan.', '2 Department of Electrical Engineering, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', '3 Department of Multimedia and Game Developing Management, Far East University, Tainan, Taiwan.

606,The use of natural language processing to identify vaccine-related anaphylaxis at five health care systems in the Vaccine Safety Datalink,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      The objective was to develop a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm to identify vaccine-related anaphylaxis from plain-text clinical notes, and to implement the algorithm at five health care systems in the Vaccine Safety Datalink. Methods:
      
    

    
      The NLP algorithm was developed using an internal NLP tool and training dataset of 311 potential anaphylaxis cases from Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC). We applied the algorithm to the notes of another 731 potential cases (423 from KPSC; 308 from other sites) with relevant codes (ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes for anaphylaxis, vaccine adverse reactions, and allergic reactions; Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System codes for epinephrine administration). NLP results were compared against a reference standard of chart reviewed and adjudicated cases. The algorithm was then separately applied to the notes of 6 427 359 KPSC vaccination visits (9 402 194 vaccine doses) without relevant codes. Results:
      
    

    
      At KPSC, NLP identified 12 of 16 true vaccine-related cases and achieved a sensitivity of 75.0%, specificity of 98.5%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 66.7%, and negative predictive value of 99.0% when applied to notes of patients with relevant diagnosis codes. NLP did not identify the five true cases at other sites. When NLP was applied to the notes of KPSC patients without relevant codes, it captured eight additional true cases confirmed by chart review and adjudication. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The current study demonstrated the potential to apply rule-based NLP algorithms to clinical notes to identify anaphylaxis cases. Increasing the size of training data, including clinical notes from all participating study sites in the training data, and preprocessing the clinical notes to handle special characters could improve the performance of the NLP algorithms. We recommend adding an NLP process followed by manual chart review in future vaccine safety studies to improve sensitivity and efficiency.","['1 Kaiser Permanente Southern California, Pasadena, CA, USA.', '2 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA.', '3 Kaiser Permanente Colorado, Denver, CO, USA.', '4 Kaiser Permanente Northwest, Portland, OR, USA.', '5 Marshfield Clinic Research Institute, Marshfield, WI, USA.', '6 Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute (previously Group Health Research Institute), Seattle, WA, USA.']","Wei Yu, Chengyi Zheng, Fagen Xie, Wansu Chen, Cheryl Mercado, Lina S Sy, Lei Qian, Sungching Glenn, Hung F Tseng, Gina Lee, Jonathan Duffy, Michael M McNeil, Matthew F Daley, Brad Crane, Huong Q McLean, Lisa A Jackson, Steven J Jacobsen, ",Pharmacoepidemiology and drug safety,2020 Feb,allergic reaction; anaphylaxis; clinical notes; natural language processing; vaccine safety.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31797475

While domain adaptation research can have a positive impact on this problem, the most widely studied paradigms do not take into account the realities of clinical data sharing. To address this issue, we lay out a taxonomy of domain adaptation, parameterizing by what data is shareable. We show that the most realistic settings for clinical use cases are seriously under-studied. To support research in these important directions, we make a series of recommendations, not just for domain adaptation but for clinical NLP in general, that ensure that data, shared tasks, and released models are broadly useful, and that initiate research directions where the clinical NLP community can lead the broader NLP and machine learning fields.","['1 School of Information, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA.', ""2 Computational Health Informatics Program, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."", '3 Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']","Egoitz Laparra, Steven Bethard, Timothy A Miller, ",JAMIA open,2020,domain adaptation; machine learning; natural language processing; shared resources.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32734151

Therefore, we derive the unannotated Swahili dataset by pre-processing raw Swahili data using a Python script, formulate the syllabic alphabet and develop the Swahili word analogy dataset based on an existing English dataset.

Two different sequential assembly approaches in comparison with a direct single-step protocol were applied, and molecular organization in correlation with biological activity of the resulting nanoparticle systems was investigated. Differences in the structure of the nanoparticles were revealed by thorough physicochemical characterization including small angle neutron scattering (SANS), small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM). All hybrid systems, combining lipid and polymer, displayed significantly increased transfection in comparison to lipid/mRNA and polymer/mRNA particles alone. For the hybrid nanoparticles, characteristic differences regarding the internal organization, release characteristics, and activity were determined depending on the assembly route. The systems with the highest transfection efficacy were characterized by a heterogenous internal organization, accompanied by facilitated release. Such a system could be best obtained by the single step protocol, starting with a lipid and polymer mixture for nanoparticle formation.","['1 Department of Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceutics, Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, D-55131 Mainz, Germany.', '2 BioNTech RNA Pharmaceuticals, D-55131 Mainz, Germany.', '3 Jülich Centre for Neutron Science JCNS at Heinz Maier-Leibnitz Centrum MLZ, D-85748 Garching, Germany.', '4 European Molecular Biology Laboratory EMBL Hamburg Outstation c/o Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron DESY, 22603 Hamburg, Germany.', '5 IIIrd Dept. of Medicine, Johannes Gutenberg University Medical Center, Johannes Gutenberg University, D-55131 Mainz, Germany.', '6 Exp.

610,CoCoScore: context-aware co-occurrence scoring for text mining applications using distant supervision,"Motivation:
      
    

    
      Information extraction by mining the scientific literature is key to uncovering relations between biomedical entities. Most existing approaches based on natural language processing extract relations from single sentence-level co-mentions, ignoring co-occurrence statistics over the whole corpus. Existing approaches counting entity co-occurrences ignore the textual context of each co-occurrence. Results:
      
    

    
      We propose a novel corpus-wide co-occurrence scoring approach to relation extraction that takes the textual context of each co-mention into account. Our method, called CoCoScore, scores the certainty of stating an association for each sentence that co-mentions two entities. CoCoScore is trained using distant supervision based on a gold-standard set of associations between entities of interest. Instead of requiring a manually annotated training corpus, co-mentions are labeled as positives/negatives according to their presence/absence in the gold standard. We show that CoCoScore outperforms previous approaches in identifying human disease-gene and tissue-gene associations as well as in identifying physical and functional protein-protein associations in different species.

611,"An update on guanylyl cyclase C in the diagnosis, chemoprevention, and treatment of colorectal cancer","Introduction:
      
    

    
      Colorectal cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States, underscoring the need for novel therapies. Despite the successes of new targeted agents for other cancers, colorectal cancer suffers from a relative scarcity of actionable biomarkers. In this context, the intestinal receptor, guanylyl cyclase C (GUCY2C), has emerged as a promising target. Areas covered:
      
    

    
      GUCY2C regulates a tumor suppressive signaling axis that is silenced through loss of its endogenous ligands at the earliest stages of tumorigenesis. A body of literature supports a cancer chemoprevention strategy involving reactivation of GUCY2C through FDA-approved cGMP-elevating agents such as linaclotide, plecanatide, and sildenafil. Its limited expression in extra-intestinal tissues, and retention on the surface of cancer cells, also positions GUCY2C as a target for immunotherapies to treat metastatic disease, including vaccines, chimeric antigen receptor T-cells, and antibody-drug conjugates. Likewise, GUCY2C mRNA identifies metastatic cells, enhancing colorectal cancer detection and staging. Pre-clinical and clinical programs exploring these GUCY2C-targeting strategies will be reviewed. Expert opinion:
      
    

    
      Recent mechanistic insights characterizing GUCY2C ligand loss early in tumorigenesis, coupled with results from the first clinical trials testing GUCY2C-targeting strategies, continue to elevate GUCY2C as an ideal target for prevention, detection, and therapy.","['1 Department of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Thomas Jefferson University , 1020 Locust Street Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.']","Jeffrey A Rappaport, Scott A Waldman, ",Expert review of clinical pharmacology,2020,Colorectal cancer; GUCY2C; guanylin; hormone replacement; immunotherapy; linaclotide; plecanatide.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32945718
612,TriMix and tumor antigen mRNA electroporated dendritic cell vaccination plus ipilimumab: link between T-cell activation and clinical responses in advanced melanoma,"Background:
      
    

    
      We previously reported that dendritic cell-based mRNA vaccination plus ipilimumab (TriMixDC-MEL IPI) results in an encouraging rate of tumor responses in patients with pretreated advanced melanoma. Here, we report the TriMixDC-MEL IPI-induced T-cell responses detected in the peripheral blood. Methods:
      
    

    
      Monocyte-derived dendritic cells electroporated with mRNA encoding CD70, CD40 ligand, and constitutively active TLR4 (TriMix) as well as the tumor-associated antigens tyrosinase, gp100, MAGE-A3, or MAGE-C2 were administered together with IPI for four cycles. For 18/39 patients, an additional vaccine was administered before the first IPI administration. We evaluated tumor-associated antigen specific T-cell responses in previously collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells, available from 15 patients. Results:
      
    

    
      Vaccine-induced enzyme-linked immunospot assay responses detected after in vitro T-cell stimulation were shown in 12/15 patients. Immune responses detected in patients with a complete or partial response were significantly stronger and broader, and exhibited a higher degree of multifunctionality compared with responses in patients with stable or progressive disease. CD8+ T-cell responses from patients with an ongoing clinical response, either elicited by TriMixDC-MEL IPI or on subsequent pembrolizumab treatment, exhibited the highest degree of multifunctionality. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      TriMixDC-MEL IPI treatment results in robust CD8+ T-cell responses in a meaningful portion of stage III or IV melanoma patients, and obviously in patients with a clinical response. The levels of polyfunctional and multiantigen T-cell responses measured in patients with a complete response, particularly in patients evidently cured after 5+ years of follow-up, may provide a benchmark for the level of immune stimulation needed to achieve a durable clinical remission.

613,Finding relevant free-text radiology reports at scale with IBM Watson Content Analytics: a feasibility study in the UK NHS,"Background:
      
    

    
      Significant amounts of health data are stored as free-text within clinical reports, letters, discharge summaries and notes. Busy clinicians have limited time to read such large amounts of free-text and are at risk of information overload and consequently missing information vital to patient care. Automatically identifying relevant information at the point of care has the potential to reduce these risks but represents a considerable research challenge. One software solution that has been proposed in industry is the IBM Watson analytics suite which includes rule-based analytics capable of processing large document collections at scale. Results:
      
    

    
      In this paper we present an overview of IBM Watson Content Analytics and a feasibility study using Content Analytics with a large-scale corpus of clinical free-text reports within a UK National Health Service (NHS) context. We created dictionaries and rules for identifying positive incidence of hydronephrosis and brain metastasis from 5.6 m radiology reports and were able to achieve 94% precision, 95% recall and 89% precision, 94% recall respectively on a sample of manually annotated reports. With minor changes for US English we applied the same rule set to an open access corpus of 0.5 m radiology reports from a US hospital and achieved 93% precision, 94% recall and 84% precision, 88% recall respectively. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We were able to implement IBM Watson within a UK NHS context and demonstrate effective results that could provide clinicians with an automatic safety net which highlights clinically important information within free-text documents. Our results suggest that currently available technologies such as IBM Watson Content Analytics already have the potential to address information overload and improve clinical safety and that solutions developed in one hospital and country may be transportable to different hospitals and countries. Our study was limited to exploring technical aspects of the feasibility of one industry solution and we recognise that healthcare text analytics research is a fast-moving field. That said, we believe our study suggests that text analytics is sufficiently advanced to be implemented within industry solutions that can improve clinical safety.","['1 Leeds Institute of Medical Education, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK.

A number of state-of-the-art deep learning methods for NER, such as Bi-LSTM-CRF (bidirec tional long-short-term-memory conditional random fields), have been applied for de-identification. Neural language models used for language representation bring great improvement in lots of NLP tasks when they are integrated with other deep learning methods. In this paper, we introduce Bi-LSTM-CRF with neural language models for de- identification of clinical text, and evaluate it on the de-identification datasets of the i2b2 2014 and the CEGS N- GRID 2016 challenges. Four neural language models of three types individually integrated with Bi-LSTM-CRF are compared in this study. Bi-LSTM-CRF with neural language models achieves the highest ""strict"" micro-averaged F1-score of 95.50% on the i2b2 2014 dataset and 91.82% on the CEGS N-GRID 2016 dataset, becoming new benchmark results on these two datasets respectively Keywords: De-identification, Named entity recognition, Bidirectional long-short-term-memory, Conditional ran dom fields, Neural language models.","['1 Key Laboratory of Network Oriented Intelligent Computation, Harbin Institute of Tech-nology, Shenzhen, China.', '2 Corresponding author: tangbuzhou@gmail.com.', '3 Yidu Cloud (Beijing) Technology Co., Ltd, Beijing, China.', '4 Ying Shen, Peking University, Shenzhen Graduate School, Shenzhen, China.']","Buzhou Tang, Dehuan Jiang, Qingcai Chen, Xiaolong Wang, Jun Yan, Ying Shen, ",AMIA ...

615,The three second time window in poems and language processing in general: Complementarity of discrete timing and temporal continuity,"The existence of discrete time windows has triggered the search for permanence and continuity for artists (including poets) in multiple cultures throughout history. In this article, we argue that there exists a 3-s window in the temporal structure of poems as well as in the aesthetic appreciation of poetry by reviewing previous literature on the temporal aspects of poems. This 3-s window can also be considered to be a general temporal machinery underlying human behavior, including language production and perception in general. The reafference principle has provided us a unique frame for understanding cognitive processes. However, ""time"" was absent in the original two-stage reafference principle. Therefore, we propose a three-stage cycling model of language perception, taking into account time and time windows. We also inspect the possible neural implementations of the three stages: the generation, maintenance, and comparison of predictions (as well as the integration of predictions into the representational context). These three stages are embedded in a temporal window of ~3 s and are repeated in a cycling mode, resulting in the representational context being continuously updated. Thus, it is possible that ""semantics"" could be carried forward across different time windows, being a ""glue"" linking the discrete time windows and thus achieving the subjective feeling of temporal continuity. Candidates of such ""semantic glue"" could include semantic and syntactic structures as well as identity and emotion.","['1 School of Psychological and Cognitive Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.', '2 Department of Chinese Language and Literature, Peking University, Beijing, China.', '3 Institute of Medical Psychology, Ludwig Maximillian University, Munich, Germany.', '4 Human Science Center, Ludwig Maximillian University, Munich, Germany.', '5 Beijing Key Laboratory of Behavior and Mental Health, Peking University, Beijing, China.']","Xinchi Yu, Yan Bao, ",PsyCh journal,2020 Aug,language perception; poem appreciation; reafference principle; temporal perception; time window.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32851816

      The density of information in digital health records offers new potential opportunities for automated prediction of cost-relevant outcomes. Aims:
      
    

    
      We investigated the extent to which routinely recorded data held in the electronic health record (EHR) predict priority service outcomes and whether natural language processing tools enhance the predictions. We evaluated three high priority outcomes: in-patient duration, readmission following in-patient care and high service cost after first presentation. Method:
      
    

    
      We used data obtained from a clinical database derived from the EHR of a large mental healthcare provider within the UK. We combined structured data with text-derived data relating to diagnosis statements, medication and psychiatric symptomatology. Predictors of the three different clinical outcomes were modelled using logistic regression with performance evaluated against a validation set to derive areas under receiver operating characteristic curves. Results:
      
    

    
      In validation samples, the full models (using all available data) achieved areas under receiver operating characteristic curves between 0.59 and 0.85 (in-patient duration 0.63, readmission 0.59, high service use 0.85). Adding natural language processing-derived data to the models increased the variance explained across all clinical scenarios (observed increase in r2 = 12-46%). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      EHR data offer the potential to improve routine clinical predictions by utilising previously inaccessible data.

617,Clinical applications of extracellular vesicle long RNAs,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs), primarily exosomes and microvesicles, are critical intercellular mediators of communication. Over the past decade, improved knowledge and methodologies have enabled the detection and quantification of RNA species in EVs, despite their extremely low levels. Recently, EV-associated long RNAs (exLRs) have been drawing much attention. Delivered by EVs, they have higher stability, greater difference in temporal and spatial expression, and the capacity to remodel both proximal and distal recipient cells. These properties guarantee their roles as biomarkers, therapeutic targets, vaccines, and gene therapy agents in a wide range of human diseases. Despite the progress in this area of research, limitations in both knowledge and methodologies have hindered its further development. Herein, we comprehensively reviewed studies related to exLRs, including protein-coding messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and noncoding RNAs (long noncoding RNAs and circular RNAs) in EVs to indicate their value in the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases; we also present a series of yet unsettled issues in this novel area, hence providing insights for future studies.","['1 Department of Medical Oncology, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', '2 Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', '3 Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center and Shanghai Key Laboratory of Medical Epigenetics, International Co-laboratory of Medical Epigenetics and Metabolism, Ministry of Science and Technology, Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.']","Siyuan Chen, Xiaodong Zhu, Shenglin Huang, ",Critical reviews in clinical laboratory sciences,2020,Extracellular vesicles (EVs); clinical application; long RNA species.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32393091

Developing novel methods to identify early AKI onset is of critical importance in preventing or reducing AKI complications. We built and applied multiple machine learning models to integrate clinical notes and structured physiological measurements and estimate the risk of new AKI onset using the MIMIC-III database. From the clinical notes, we generated clinically meaningful word representations and embeddings. Four supervised learning classifiers and mixed-feature deep learning architecture were used to construct prediction models. The best configurations consistently utilized both structured and unstructured clinical features and yielded competitive AUCs above 0.83. Our work suggests that integrating structured and unstructured clinical features can be effectively applied to assist clinicians in identifying the risk of incident AKI onset in critically-ill patients upon admission to the ICU.","['1 Chicago, IL, USA.', '2 Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.', '3 Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab, MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA.', '4 Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.']","Mengxin Sun, Jason Baron, Anand Dighe, Peter Szolovits, Richard G Wunderink, Tamara Isakova, Yuan Luo, ",Studies in health technology and informatics,2019,Acute Kidney Injury; Clinical Decision Support; Natural Language Processing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31437947

The analysis and data extraction from scientific literature, technical reports, health records, social media, surveys, registries and other documents can support core public health functions including the enhancement of existing surveillance systems (e.g. through faster identification of diseases and risk factors/at-risk populations), disease prevention strategies (e.g. through more efficient evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of interventions) and health promotion efforts (e.g. by providing the ability to obtain expert-level answers to any health related question). NLP is emerging as an important tool that can assist public health authorities in decreasing the burden of health inequality/inequity in the population. The purpose of this paper is to provide some notable examples of both the potential applications and challenges of NLP use in public health.","['1 Centre for Immunization and Respiratory Infectious Disease, Public Health Agency of Canada, Ottawa, ON.', '2 Data, Partnerships and Innovation Hub, Public Health Agency of Canada, Ottawa, ON.', '3 National Microbiology Laboratory, Public Health Agency of Canada, Winnipeg, MB.']","Oliver Baclic, Matthew Tunis, Kelsey Young, Coraline Doan, Howard Swerdfeger, Justin Schonfeld, ",Canada communicable disease report = Releve des maladies transmissibles au Canada,2020,NLP; artificial intelligence; machine learning; natural language processing; public health.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32673380

In this paper, an unsupervised approach for the chunking of idiomatic units of sequential text data is presented. Text chunking refers to the task of splitting a string of textual information into non-overlapping groups of related units. This is a fundamental problem in numerous fields where understanding the relation between raw units of symbolic sequential data is relevant. Existing methods are based primarily on supervised and semi-supervised learning approaches; however, in this study, a novel unsupervised approach is proposed based on the existing concept of n-grams, which requires no labeled text as an input. The proposed methodology is applied to two natural language corpora: a Wall Street Journal corpus and a Twitter corpus. In both cases, the corpus length was increased gradually to measure the accuracy with a different number of unitary elements as inputs. Both corpora reveal improvements in accuracy proportional with increases in the number of tokens. For the Twitter corpus, the increase in accuracy follows a linear trend. The results show that the proposed methodology can achieve a higher accuracy with incremental usage. A future study will aim at designing an iterative system for the proposed methodology.","['1 School of Systems and Enterprises, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, New Jersey, United States of America.']","Dario Borrelli, Gabriela Gongora Svartzman, Carlo Lipizzi, ",PloS one,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32511252

In applications such as cancer pathology reports, it is necessary not only to extract information from individual reports, but also to capture aggregate information regarding the entire cancer case based off case-level context from all reports in the sequence. In this paper, we introduce a simple modular add-on for capturing case-level context that is designed to be compatible with most existing deep learning architectures for text classification on individual reports. We test our approach on a corpus of 431,433 cancer pathology reports, and we show that incorporating case-level context significantly boosts classification accuracy across six classification tasks-site, subsite, laterality, histology, behavior, and grade. We expect that with minimal modifications, our add-on can be applied towards a wide range of other clinical text-based tasks.","['1 Computational Sciences and Engineering Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN, United States of America.', '2 Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, United States of America.', '3 Louisiana Tumor Registry, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center School of Public Health, New Orleans, LA, United States of America.', '4 Kentucky Cancer Registry, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, United States of America.', '5 Information Management Services Inc, Calverton, MD, United States of America.', '6 Data Science and Learning Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, IL, United States of America.']","Shang Gao, Mohammed Alawad, Noah Schaefferkoetter, Lynne Penberthy, Xiao-Cheng Wu, Eric B Durbin, Linda Coyle, Arvind Ramanathan, Georgia Tourassi, ",PloS one,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32396579
623,Automated Identification and Extraction of Exercise Treadmill Test Results,"Background Noninvasive cardiac tests, including exercise treadmill tests (ETTs), are commonly utilized in the evaluation of patients in the emergency department with suspected acute coronary syndrome. However, there are ongoing debates on their clinical utility and cost-effectiveness. It is important to be able to use ETT results for research, but manual review is prohibitively time-consuming for large studies. We developed and validated an automated method to interpret ETT results from electronic health records. To demonstrate the algorithm's utility, we tested the associations between ETT results with 30-day patient outcomes in a large population. Methods and Results A retrospective analysis of adult emergency department encounters resulting in an ETT within 30 days was performed. A set of randomly selected reports were double-blind reviewed by 2 physicians to validate a natural language processing algorithm designed to categorize ETT results into normal, ischemic, nondiagnostic, and equivocal categories. Natural language processing then searched and categorized results of 5214 ETT reports. The natural language processing algorithm achieved 96.4% sensitivity and 94.8% specificity in identifying normal versus all other categories. The rates of 30-day death or acute myocardial infarction varied (P<0.001) by categories for normal (0.08%), ischemic (1.9%), nondiagnostic (0.77%), and equivocal (0.58%) groups achieving good discrimination (C-statistic, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.7-0.92). Conclusions Natural language processing is an accurate and efficient strategy to facilitate large-scale outcome studies of noninvasive cardiac tests.

      Cancer immunotherapy is more dependent on monoclonal antibodies, proteins, and cells, as therapeutic agents, to attain prominent outcomes. However, cancer immunotherapy's clinical benefits need to be enhanced, as many patients still do not respond well to existing treatments, or their diseases may relapse after temporary control. RNA-based approaches have provided new options for advancing cancer immunotherapy. Moreover, considerable efforts have been made to utilize RNA for vaccine production. RNA vaccines, which encode tumor-associated or specific epitopes, stimulate adaptive immunity. This adaptive immune response is capable of elimination or reduction of tumor burden. It is crucial to develop effective RNA transfer technologies that penetrate the lipid bilayer to reach the cytoplasm for translation into functional proteins. Two important delivery methods include the loading of mRNA into dendritic cells ex vivo; and direct injection of naked RNA with or without a carrier. Areas covered:

We present 65 peptide sequences that we expect to result in a safe and effective vaccine which can be rapidly tested in DNA, mRNA, or synthetic peptide constructs. These include epitopes that are contained within evolutionarily divergent regions of the spike protein reported to increase infectivity through increased binding to the ACE2 receptor, and within a novel furin cleavage site thought to increase membrane fusion. This vaccination strategy specifically targets unique vulnerabilities of SARS-CoV-2 and should engage a robust adaptive immune response in the vast majority of the human population.

      Clinical trials are an important step in introducing new interventions into clinical practice by generating data on their safety and efficacy. Clinical trials need to ensure that participants are similar so that the findings can be attributed to the interventions studied and not to some other factors. Therefore, each clinical trial defines eligibility criteria, which describe characteristics that must be shared by the participants. Unfortunately, the complexities of eligibility criteria may not allow them to be translated directly into readily executable database queries. Instead, they may require careful analysis of the narrative sections of medical records. Manual screening of medical records is time consuming, thus negatively affecting the timeliness of the recruitment process. Objective:
      
    

    
      Track 1 of the 2018 National Natural Language Processing Clinical Challenge focused on the task of cohort selection for clinical trials, aiming to answer the following question: Can natural language processing be applied to narrative medical records to identify patients who meet eligibility criteria for clinical trials? The task required the participating systems to analyze longitudinal patient records to determine if the corresponding patients met the given eligibility criteria. We aimed to describe a system developed to address this task. Methods:
      
    

    
      Our system consisted of 13 classifiers, one for each eligibility criterion. All classifiers used a bag-of-words document representation model. To prevent the loss of relevant contextual information associated with such representation, a pattern-matching approach was used to extract context-sensitive features. They were embedded back into the text as lexically distinguishable tokens, which were consequently featured in the bag-of-words representation. Supervised machine learning was chosen wherever a sufficient number of both positive and negative instances was available to learn from. A rule-based approach focusing on a small set of relevant features was chosen for the remaining criteria. Results:
      
    

    
      The system was evaluated using microaveraged F measure. Overall, 4 machine algorithms, including support vector machine, logistic regression, naïve Bayesian classifier, and gradient tree boosting (GTB), were evaluated on the training data using 10-fold cross-validation. Overall, GTB demonstrated the most consistent performance. Its performance peaked when oversampling was used to balance the training data. The final evaluation was performed on previously unseen test data. On average, the F measure of 89.04% was comparable to 3 of the top ranked performances in the shared task (91.11%, 90.28%, and 90.21%). With an F measure of 88.14%, we significantly outperformed these systems (81.03%, 78.50%, and 70.81%) in identifying patients with advanced coronary artery disease. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The holdout evaluation provides evidence that our system was able to identify eligible patients for the given clinical trial with high accuracy. Our approach demonstrates how rule-based knowledge infusion can improve the performance of machine learning algorithms even when trained on a relatively small dataset.","['1 School of Computer Science & Informatics, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom.', '2 School of Psychology, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom.', '3 School of Mathematics, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom.']","Irena Spasic, Dominik Krzeminski, Padraig Corcoran, Alexander Balinsky, ",JMIR medical informatics,2019,clinical trial; electronic medical records; eligibility determination; machine learning; natural language processing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31674914

630,Cooperation in Online Conversations: The Response Times as a Window Into the Cognition of Language Processing,"Measuring the cognitive cost of interpreting the meaning of sentences in a conversation is a complex task, but it is also at the core of Sperber and Wilson's Relevance Theory. In cognitive sciences, the delay between a stimulus and its response is often used as an approximation of the cognitive cost. We have noticed that such a tool had not yet been used to measure the cognitive cost of interpreting the meaning of sentences in a free-flowing and interactive conversation. The following experiment tests the ability to discriminate between sentences with a high cognitive cost and sentences with a low cognitive cost using the response time of the participants during an online conversation in a protocol inspired by the Turing Test. We have used violations of Grice's Cooperative Principle to create conditions in which sentences with a high cognitive cost would be produced. We hypothesized that response times are directly correlated to the cognitive cost required to generate implicatures from a statement. Our results are coherent with the literature in the field and shed some new light on the effect of violations on the humanness of a conversational agent. We show that violations of the maxim of Relation had a particularly important impact on response times and the perceived humanness of a conversation partner. Violations of the first maxim of Quantity and the fourth maxim of Manner had a lesser impact, and only on male participants.","['1 P-A-R-I-S Association, Paris, France.', '2 Laboratoire CHArt, Université Paris VIII & EPHE, Paris, France.', '3 Institut Jean Nicod (IJN), École Normale Supérieure (ENS), Paris, France.', '4 Université de Cergy-Pontoise, Cergy-Pontoise, France.']","Baptiste Jacquet, Jean Baratgin, Frank Jamet, ",Frontiers in psychology,2019,Turing test; conversational expectations; cooperation; natural language; online conversations; pragmatics; relevance.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31024385
631,Building a tobacco user registry by extracting multiple smoking behaviors from clinical notes,"Background:
      
    

    
      Usage of structured fields in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to ascertain smoking history is important but fails in capturing the nuances of smoking behaviors. Knowledge of smoking behaviors, such as pack year history and most recent cessation date, allows care providers to select the best care plan for patients at risk of smoking attributable diseases. Methods:
      
    

    
      We developed and evaluated a health informatics pipeline for identifying complete smoking history from clinical notes in EHRs. We utilized 758 patient-visit notes (from visits between 03/28/2016 and 04/04/2016) from our local EHR in addition to a public dataset of 502 clinical notes from the 2006 i2b2 Challenge to assess the performance of this pipeline. We used a machine-learning classifier to extract smoking status and a comprehensive set of text processing regular expressions to extract pack years and cessation date information from these clinical notes. Results:
      
    

    
      We identified smoking status with an F1 score of 0.90 on both the i2b2 and local data sets. Regular expression identification of pack year history in the local test set was 91.7% sensitive and 95.2% specific, but due to variable context the pack year extraction was incomplete in 25% of cases, extracting packs per day or years smoked only. Regular expression identification of cessation date was 63.2% sensitive and 94.6% specific. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our work indicates that the development of an EHR-based Smokers' Registry containing information relating to smoking behaviors, not just status, from free-text clinical notes using an informatics pipeline is feasible. This pipeline is capable of functioning in external EHRs, reducing the amount of time and money needed at the institute-level to create a Smokers' Registry for improved identification of patient risk and eligibility for preventative and early detection services.","['1 Dartmouth College, HB 7922, 03755, Hanover, NH, USA. elp76@case.edu.', '2 Dartmouth College, HB 7261, 03755, Hanover, NH, USA.', '3 Dartmouth College, HB 7920, 03755, Hanover, NH, USA.', '4 Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, 2000 Circle of Hope Dr, Salt Lake City, UT, 84112, USA.', '5 Dartmouth College, HB 7927, 03755, Hanover, NH, USA.']","Ellen L Palmer, Saeed Hassanpour, John Higgins, Jennifer A Doherty, Tracy Onega, ",BMC medical informatics and decision making,2019,Electronic health records; Informatics pipeline; Natural language processing; Smokers registry.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31340796
632,A Genetic Vaccine Encoding Shared Cancer Neoantigens to Treat Tumors with Microsatellite Instability,"Tumors with microsatellite instability (MSI) are caused by a defective DNA mismatch repair system that leads to the accumulation of mutations within microsatellite regions. Indels in microsatellites of coding genes can result in the synthesis of frameshift peptides (FSP). FSPs are tumor-specific neoantigens shared across patients with MSI. In this study, we developed a neoantigen-based vaccine for the treatment of MSI tumors. Genetic sequences from 320 MSI tumor biopsies and matched healthy tissues in The Cancer Genome Atlas database were analyzed to select shared FSPs. Two hundred nine FSPs were selected and cloned into nonhuman Great Ape Adenoviral and Modified Vaccinia Ankara vectors to generate a viral-vectored vaccine, referred to as Nous-209. Sequencing tumor biopsies of 20 independent patients with MSI colorectal cancer revealed that a median number of 31 FSPs out of the 209 encoded by the vaccine was detected both in DNA and mRNA extracted from each tumor biopsy. A relevant number of peptides encoded by the vaccine were predicted to bind patient HLA haplotypes. Vaccine immunogenicity was demonstrated in mice with potent and broad induction of FSP-specific CD8 and CD4 T-cell responses. Moreover, a vaccine-encoded FSP was processed in vitro by human antigen-presenting cells and was subsequently able to activate human CD8 T cells. Nous-209 is an ""off-the-shelf"" cancer vaccine encoding many neoantigens shared across sporadic and hereditary MSI tumors. These results indicate that Nous-209 can induce the optimal breadth of immune responses that might achieve clinical benefit to treat and prevent MSI tumors. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings demonstrate the feasibility of an ""off-the-shelf"" vaccine for treatment and prevention of tumors harboring frameshift mutations and neoantigenic peptides as a result of microsatellite instability.","['1 Nouscom S.R.L., Rome, Italy. g.leoni@nouscom.com.', '2 Nouscom S.R.L., Rome, Italy.', '3 Reithera S.R.L.

633,Risk assessment strategies for early detection and prediction of infectious disease outbreaks associated with climate change,"A new generation of surveillance strategies is being developed to help detect emerging infections and to identify the increased risks of infectious disease outbreaks that are expected to occur with climate change. These surveillance strategies include event-based surveillance (EBS) systems and risk modelling. The EBS systems use open-source internet data, such as media reports, official reports, and social media (such as Twitter) to detect evidence of an emerging threat, and can be used in conjunction with conventional surveillance systems to enhance early warning of public health threats. More recently, EBS systems include artificial intelligence applications such machine learning and natural language processing to increase the speed, capacity and accuracy of filtering, classifying and analysing health-related internet data. Risk modelling uses statistical and mathematical methods to assess the severity of disease emergence and spread given factors about the host (e.g. number of reported cases), pathogen (e.g. pathogenicity) and environment (e.g. climate suitability for reservoir populations). The types of data in these models are expanding to include health-related information from open-source internet data and information on mobility patterns of humans and goods. This information is helping to identify susceptible populations and predict the pathways from which infections might spread into new areas and new countries. As a powerful addition to traditional surveillance strategies that identify what has already happened, it is anticipated that EBS systems and risk modelling will increasingly be used to inform public health actions to prevent, detect and mitigate the climate change increases in infectious diseases.","['1 Public Health Risk Sciences Division, National Microbiology Laboratory, Public Health Agency of Canada, St. Hyacinthe, QC.', '2 Public Health Risk Sciences Division, National Microbiology Laboratory, Public Health Agency of Canada, Guelph, ON.', ""3 Centre pour l'Étude et la Simulation du Climat à l'Échelle Régionale (ESCER), Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM), Montréal, QC."", '4 Office of Situational Awareness and Operations, Centre for Emergency Preparedness and Response, Public Health Agency of Canada, Ottawa, ON.', '5 Natural Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Service, Great Lakes Forestry Centre, Sault Ste.

634,Natural language processing for automated detection of incidental durotomy,"Background:
      
    

    
      Incidental durotomy is a common intraoperative complication during spine surgery with potential implications for postoperative recovery, patient-reported outcomes, length of stay, and costs. To our knowledge, there are no processes available for automated surveillance of incidental durotomy. Purpose:
      
    

    
      The purpose of this study was to develop natural language processing (NLP) algorithms for automated detection of incidental durotomies in free-text operative notes of patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery. Patient sample:
      
    

    
      Adult patients 18 years or older undergoing lumbar spine surgery between January 1, 2000 and June 31, 2018 at two academic and three community medical centers. Outcome measures:
      
    

    
      The primary outcome was defined as intraoperative durotomy recorded in free-text operative notes. Methods:
      
    

    
      An 80:20 stratified split was undertaken to create training and testing populations. An extreme gradient-boosting NLP algorithm was developed to detect incidental durotomy. Discrimination was assessed via area under receiver-operating curve (AUC-ROC), precision-recall curve, and Brier score. Performance of this algorithm was compared with current procedural terminology (CPT) and international classification of diseases (ICD) codes for durotomy. Results:
      
    

    
      Overall, 1,000 patients were included in the study and 93 (9.3%) had a recorded incidental durotomy in the free-text operative report. In the independent testing set (n=200) not used for model development, the NLP algorithm achieved AUC-ROC of 0.99 for detection of durotomy. In comparison, the CPT/ICD codes had AUC-ROC of 0.64. In the testing set, the NLP algorithm detected 16 of 18 patients with incidental durotomy (sensitivity 0.89) whereas the CPT and ICD codes detected 5 of 18 (sensitivity 0.28). At a threshold of 0.05, the NLP algorithm had specificity of 0.99, positive predictive value of 0.89, and negative predictive value of 0.99. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Internal validation of the NLP algorithm developed in this study indicates promising results for future NLP applications in spine surgery. Pending external validation, the NLP algorithm developed in this study may be used by entities including national spine registries or hospital quality and safety departments to automate tracking of incidental durotomies.","[""1 Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 55 Fruit St, Boston, MA 02114, USA; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115, USA."", '2 Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 55 Fruit St, Boston, MA 02114, USA.', ""3 Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115, USA."", '4 Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 55 Fruit St, Boston, MA 02114, USA.

      The impact of new technologies on elderly people is evaluated with respect to the three main topics faced by NINFA. Methods:
      
    

    
      NINFA was structured into three main topics: (1) active user engagement from the very beginning of the planning stage: the use of specially designed questionnaires to evaluate the acceptability of new technology in general and robot caregiver specifically; (2) assessment of the well-being through non-invasive techniques: natural language processing for language change monitoring in elderly subjects; (3) automated assessment of motor and cognitive functions at home: systems to deliver tests and exergames through user interfaces compliant with elderly subjects. Results:
      
    

    
      The analysis shows that there is no a priori closure to support the technology, but it must not be invasive and must allow social interactions. The study of speech transcripts shows that a large variations in the number of words used to describe the same situation could be a sign on the onset of cognitive impairments. The specifically designed systems highlight, after the training period, significant improvements in the performances of the participants and a satisfaction with regards to the systems usability.

639,The chaperone ERp29 is required for tunneling nanotube formation by stabilizing MSec,"Tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) are membrane conduits that mediate long-distance intercellular cross-talk in several organisms and play vital roles during development, pathogenic transmission, and cancer metastasis. However, the molecular mechanisms of TNT formation and function remain poorly understood. The protein MSec (also known as TNFα-induced protein 2 (TNFAIP2) and B94) is essential for TNT formation in multiple cell types. Here, using affinity protein purification, mass spectrometric identification, and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy assays, we found that MSec interacts with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone ERp29. siRNA-mediated ERp29 depletion in mammalian cells significantly reduces TNT formation, whereas its overexpression induces TNT formation, but in a strictly MSec-dependent manner. ERp29 stabilized MSec protein levels, but not its mRNA levels, and the chaperone activity of ERp29 was required for maintaining MSec protein stability. Subcellular ER fractionation and subsequent limited proteolytic treatment suggested that MSec is associated with the outer surface of the ER. The ERp29-MSec interaction appeared to require the presence of other bridging protein(s), perhaps triggered by post-translational modification of ERp29. Our study implicates MSec as a target of ERp29 and reveals an indispensable role for the ER in TNT formation, suggesting new modalities for regulating TNT numbers in cells and tissues.","['1 From the Laboratory of Cellular Dynamics, Regional Centre for Biotechnology, and.', '2 the Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal Karnataka 576104, and.', '3 the Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology, Bhubaneswar Odisha 751024, India.', '4 the HIV Vaccine Translational Research Laboratory, Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, NCR Biotech Science Cluster, Faridabad Haryana 121001.', '5 From the Laboratory of Cellular Dynamics, Regional Centre for Biotechnology, and sivaram@rcb.res.in.']","Rajaiah Pergu, Sunayana Dagar, Harsh Kumar, Rajesh Kumar, Jayanta Bhattacharya, Sivaram V S Mylavarapu, ",The Journal of biological chemistry,2019,MSec; TNFα-induced protein 2 (TNAIP2); cell-cell interaction; chaperone; endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum (ER); endoplasmic reticulum protein 29 (ERP29); interactome; intercellular communication; plasma membrane; post-translational modification (PTM); protein stability; protein-disulfide isomerase; tunneling nanotubes.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30877198

Such annotations are widely used in building the semantic parsing models (which aim at understanding the precise meaning of natural language questions by converting them to machine-understandable logical forms). These systems focus on reducing the time it takes for a user to get to information present in electronic health records (EHRs). Directly annotating questions with logical forms is a challenging task and involves a time-consuming step of concept normalization annotation. We aim to automate this step using the normalized codes present in a FHIR resource. Using the proposed approach, two annotators curated an annotated dataset of 1000 questions in less than 1 week. To assess the quality of these annotations, we trained a semantic parsing model which achieved an accuracy of 94.2% on this corpus.","['1 School of Biomedical Informatics, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX.', '2 Department of Computer & Information Science & Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL.']","Sarvesh Soni, Meghana Gudala, Daisy Zhe Wang, Kirk Roberts, ",AMIA ...

642,A deep learning model incorporating part of speech and self-matching attention for named entity recognition of Chinese electronic medical records,"Background:
      
    

    
      The Named Entity Recognition (NER) task as a key step in the extraction of health information, has encountered many challenges in Chinese Electronic Medical Records (EMRs). Firstly, the casual use of Chinese abbreviations and doctors' personal style may result in multiple expressions of the same entity, and we lack a common Chinese medical dictionary to perform accurate entity extraction. Secondly, the electronic medical record contains entities from a variety of categories of entities, and the length of those entities in different categories varies greatly, which increases the difficult in the extraction for the Chinese NER. Therefore, the entity boundary detection becomes the key to perform accurate entity extraction of Chinese EMRs, and we need to develop a model that supports multiple length entity recognition without relying on any medical dictionary. Methods:
      
    

    
      In this study, we incorporate part-of-speech (POS) information into the deep learning model to improve the accuracy of Chinese entity boundary detection. In order to avoid the wrongly POS tagging of long entities, we proposed a method called reduced POS tagging that reserves the tags of general words but not of the seemingly medical entities. The model proposed in this paper, named SM-LSTM-CRF, consists of three layers: self-matching attention layer - calculating the relevance of each character to the entire sentence; LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) layer - capturing the context feature of each character; CRF (Conditional Random Field) layer - labeling characters based on their features and transfer rules. Results:
      
    

    
      The experimental results at a Chinese EMRs dataset show that the F1 value of SM-LSTM-CRF is increased by 2.59% compared to that of the LSTM-CRF. After adding POS feature in the model, we get an improvement of about 7.74% at F1. The reduced POS tagging reduces the false tagging on long entities, thus increases the F1 value by 2.42% and achieves an F1 score of 80.07%. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The POS feature marked by the reduced POS tagging together with self-matching attention mechanism puts a stranglehold on entity boundaries and has a good performance in the recognition of clinical entities.","['1 Communication & Computer Network Lab of Guangdong, School of Computer Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China.', '2 Communication & Computer Network Lab of Guangdong, School of Computer Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China. sbdong@scut.edu.cn.']","Xiaoling Cai, Shoubin Dong, Jinlong Hu, ",BMC medical informatics and decision making,2019,Chinese electronic medical records; Named entity recognition; Part of speech.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30961622
643,Identification of a neoantigen epitope in a melanoma patient with good response to anti-PD-1 antibody therapy,"Recent advances in next-generation sequencing have enabled rapid and efficient evaluation of the mutational landscape of cancers. As a result, many cancer-specific neoantigens, which can generate antitumor cytotoxic T-cells inside tumors, have been identified. Previously, we reported a metastatic melanoma case with high tumor mutation burden, who obtained complete remission after anti-PD-1 therapy and surgical resection. The rib metastatic lesion, which was used for whole-exome sequencing and gene expression profiling in the HOPE project, showed upregulated expression of PD-L1 mRNA and a high single-nucleotide variants number of 2712. In the current study, we focused on a metastatic melanoma case and candidate epitopes among nonsynonymous mutant neoantigens of 1348 variants were investigated using a peptide-HLA binding algorithm, in vitro cytotoxic T-cell induction assay and HLA tetramer staining. Specifically, from mutant neoantigen data, a total of 21,066 9-mer mutant epitope candidates including a mutated amino acid anywhere in the sequence were applied to the NetMHC binding prediction algorithm. From in silico data, we identified the top 26 mutant epitopes with strong-binding capacity. A cytotoxic T-cell induction assay using 5 cancer patient-derived PBMCs revealed that the mutant ARMT1 peptide sequence (FYGKTILWF) with HLA-A*2402 restriction was an efficient neoantigen, which was detected at a frequency of approximately 0.04% in the HLA-A24 tetramer stain. The present success in identifying a novel mutant antigen epitope might be applied to clinical neoantigen screening in the context of an NGS-equipped medical facility for the development of the next-generation neoantigen cancer vaccines.","['1 Immunotherapy Division, Shizuoka Cancer Center Research Institute, 1007 Shimonagakubo, Nagaizumi-cho, Sunto-gun, Shizuoka 411-8777, Japan.', '2 Immunotherapy Division, Shizuoka Cancer Center Research Institute, 1007 Shimonagakubo, Nagaizumi-cho, Sunto-gun, Shizuoka 411-8777, Japan; Division of Dermatology, Shizuoka Cancer Center Hospital, 1007 Shimonagakubo, Nagaizumi-cho, Sunto-gun, Shizuoka 411-8777, Japan.', '3 Medical Genetics Division, Shizuoka Cancer Center Research Institute, 1007 Shimonagakubo, Nagaizumi-cho, Sunto-gun, Shizuoka 411-8777, Japan.', '4 Division of Dermatology, Shizuoka Cancer Center Hospital, 1007 Shimonagakubo, Nagaizumi-cho, Sunto-gun, Shizuoka 411-8777, Japan.', '5 Cancer Diagnostics Research Division, Shizuoka Cancer Center Research Institute, 1007 Shimonagakubo, Nagaizumi-cho, Sunto-gun, Shizuoka 411-8777, Japan.', '6 Cancer Diagnostics Research Division, Shizuoka Cancer Center Research Institute, 1007 Shimonagakubo, Nagaizumi-cho, Sunto-gun, Shizuoka 411-8777, Japan; SRL Inc., Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 163-0409, Japan.', '7 Regional Resources Division, Shizuoka Cancer Center Research Institute, 1007 Shimonagakubo, Nagaizumi-cho, Sunto-gun, Shizuoka 411-8777, Japan.', '8 Division of Neurosurgery, Shizuoka Cancer Center Hospital, 1007 Shimonagakubo, Nagaizumi-cho, Sunto-gun, Shizuoka 411-8777, Japan.', '9 Office of the President, Shizuoka Cancer Center Hospital, 1007 Shimonagakubo, Nagaizumi-cho, Sunto-gun, Shizuoka 411-8777, Japan.', '10 Immunotherapy Division, Shizuoka Cancer Center Research Institute, 1007 Shimonagakubo, Nagaizumi-cho, Sunto-gun, Shizuoka 411-8777, Japan.

644,Large-scale quantitative profiling of the Old English verse tradition,"The corpus of Old English verse is an indispensable source for scholars of the Indo-European tradition, early Germanic culture and English literary history. Although it has been the focus of sustained literary scholarship for over two centuries, Old English poetry has not been subjected to corpus-wide computational profiling, in part because of the sparseness and extreme fragmentation of the surviving material. Here we report a detailed quantitative analysis of the whole corpus that considers a broad range of features reflective of sound, metre and diction. This integrated examination of fine-grained features enabled us to identify salient stylistic patterns, despite the inherent limitations of the corpus. In particular, we provide quantitative evidence consistent with the unitary authorship of Beowulf and the Cynewulfian authorship of Andreas, shedding light on two longstanding questions in Old English philology. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of high-dimensional stylometric profiling for fragmentary literary traditions and lay the foundation for future studies of the cultural evolution of English literature.","['1 Department of English, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China.', '2 Program for Evolutionary Dynamics, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA. mkrieger@fas.harvard.edu.', '3 Research Science Institute, Center for Excellence in Education, McLean, VA, USA.', '4 Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science, Denton, TX, USA.', '5 Department of Classics, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA.', '6 Department of Systems Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA. jdexter@fas.harvard.edu.']","Leonard Neidorf, Madison S Krieger, Michelle Yakubek, Pramit Chaudhuri, Joseph P Dexter, ",Nature human behaviour,2019 Jun,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30962615
645,ProtoSteer: Steering Deep Sequence Model with Prototypes,"Recently we have witnessed growing adoption of deep sequence models (e.g. LSTMs) in many application domains, including predictive health care, natural language processing, and log analysis. However, the intricate working mechanism of these models confines their accessibility to the domain experts. Their black-box nature also makes it a challenging task to incorporate domain-specific knowledge of the experts into the model. In ProtoSteer (Prototype Steering), we tackle the challenge of directly involving the domain experts to steer a deep sequence model without relying on model developers as intermediaries. Our approach originates in case-based reasoning, which imitates the common human problem-solving process of consulting past experiences to solve new problems. We utilize ProSeNet (Prototype Sequence Network), which learns a small set of exemplar cases (i.e., prototypes) from historical data. In ProtoSteer they serve both as an efficient visual summary of the original data and explanations of model decisions. With ProtoSteer the domain experts can inspect, critique, and revise the prototypes interactively. The system then incorporates user-specified prototypes and incrementally updates the model. We conduct extensive case studies and expert interviews in application domains including sentiment analysis on texts and predictive diagnostics based on vehicle fault logs. The results demonstrate that involvements of domain users can help obtain more interpretable models with concise prototypes while retaining similar accuracy.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Yao Ming, Panpan Xu, Furui Cheng, Huamin Qu, Liu Ren, ",IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics,2020 Jan,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31514137

647,"Exosomes and Lung cancer: Roles in pathophysiology, diagnosis and therapeutic applications","Lung cancer is a malignancy with a high morbidity and mortality rate, and affected patients have low survival and poor prognosis. The therapeutic approaches for the treatment of this cancer, including radiotherapy and chemotherapy, are not particularly effective partly due late diagnosis. Therefore, the search for new diagnostic and prognostic tools is a critical issue. Novel biomarkers, such as exosomes, could be considered as potential diagnostic tools for malignancies, particularly lung cancer. Exosomes are nanovesicles, which are associated with different physiological and pathological conditions. It has been shown that these particles are released from many cells such as cancer cells, immune cells and to some degree normal cells. Exosomes could alter the behavior of target cells though intercellular transfer of their cargo (e.g., DNA, mRNA, long non-coding RNAs, microRNAs and proteins). Thus, these vehicles may play pivotal roles in various physiological and pathological conditions. The current insights into lung cancer pathogenesis suggest that exosomes are key players in the pathogenesis of this cancer. Hence, these nanovesicles and their cargos could be used as new diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic biomarkers in the treatment of lung cancer. Besides the diagnostic roles of exosomes, their use as drug delivery systems and as cancer vaccines is under investigation. The present review summarizes the current information on the diagnostic and pathogenic functions of exosomes in lung cancer.","['1 Department of Medical Biotechnology, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashahd, Iran.', '2 Halal Research Center of IRI, FDA, Tehran, Iran.', '3 Department of Medical Immunology, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', '4 Department of Virology, Faculty of Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', '5 Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran.', '6 Department of Molecular Medicine, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', '7 Research Center for Biochemistry and Nutrition in Metabolic Diseases, Institute for Basic Sciences, Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, Iran.', '8 Wellman Center for Photomedicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 40 Blossom Street, Boston, MA, 02114, United States.']","Atefeh Amiri, Mohammad Hossein Pourhanifeh, Hamid Reza Mirzaei, Javid Sadri Nahand, Mohsen Moghoofei, Roxana Sahebnasagh, Hamed Mirzaei, Michael R Hamblin, ",Current medicinal chemistry,2020,Cancer vaccines; Diagnostic biomarkers; Drug delivery vehicles; Exosomes; Lung cancer; MicroRNAs.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32013817

      Detecting adverse drug events (ADEs) and medications related information in clinical notes is important for both hospital medical care and medical research. We describe our clinical natural language processing (NLP) system to automatically extract medical concepts and relations related to ADEs and medications from clinical narratives. This work was part of the 2018 National NLP Clinical Challenges Shared Task and Workshop on Adverse Drug Events and Medication Extraction. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      The authors developed a hybrid clinical NLP system that employs a knowledge-based general clinical NLP system for medical concepts extraction, and a task-specific deep learning system for relations identification using attention-based bidirectional long short-term memory networks. Results:
      
    

    
      The systems were evaluated as part of the 2018 National NLP Clinical Challenges challenge, and our attention-based bidirectional long short-term memory networks based system obtained an F-measure of 0.9442 for relations identification task, ranking fifth at the challenge, and had <2% difference from the best system.

650,Adverse Drug Reaction Case Safety Practices in Large Biopharmaceutical Organizations from 2007 to 2017: An Industry Survey,"Introduction:
      
    

    
      Drug safety remains a top global public health concern. An increase in the number of data sources available has increased the complexity of pharmacovigilance operations, so the US FDA has created draft guidance focusing on optimizing drug safety data for well-characterized medicines. However, to date, no data demonstrating changes in reports have been presented. Objectives:
      
    

    
      This study provided data assessing changes in individual case safety reports (ICSRs) and aggregate reports (ARs) for large biopharmaceutical companies from 2007 to 2017. This study also evaluated current trends on the use of advanced machine and deep learning in order to process all data captured for ICSRs as well as opinions from industry thought leaders on creating a sustainable case-processing operation. Methodology:
      
    

    
      Using data captured from Navitas Life Science's annual pvnet® benchmark, we calculated workload indicators characterizing pharmacovigilance operations for large biopharmaceutical organizations. Workload indicators included the number of ICSRs by organization, the number of ARs, and the number and types of data sources used. We also conducted structured in-depth interviews with seven biopharmaceutical executives to discover the reasons for changes in workload indicators across time as well as current strategies for increasing efficiencies in drug safety reporting. Results:
      
    

    
      The median number of ICSRs increased from 84,960 cases in 2007 to over 200,000 cases in 2017; this increase was largely attributable to an increase in both nonserious cases and follow-up cases. Member companies reported using 12 ± 3 data sources for case identification. The number of ARs also increased from a median of 70 reports in 2007 to 258 reports in 2017. To address these increases, 61% of the biopharmaceutical organizations we surveyed planned to adopt machine learning for full ICSR processing; however, as of 2018, none of the organizations surveyed had mechanisms in place. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      This study demonstrated that pharmacovigilance departments are currently burdened by ever-increasing case volumes. With increased guidance from regulatory agencies, as well as improvements in artificial intelligence and natural language processing, biopharmaceutical organizations must determine the most resource-efficient and sustainable methods to process the growing volume of cases.","['1 Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development, Tufts University School of Medicine, 75 Kneeland Street, Ste 1100, Boston, MA, 02111, USA.

      Almost 25% of Medicare beneficiaries live in residential long-term care (LTC) (eg, independent or assisted living facility or nursing home). There are few reliable statistics on completed suicide in LTC, in part because of data limitations. Objectives:
      
    

    
      To estimate the number of suicides associated with residential LTC (ie, among persons in a facility, transitioning into or out of a facility, or otherwise associated with LTC) among adults 55 and older and, secondarily, to identify whether machine learning tools could improve the quality of suicide surveillance data. Design, setting, and participants:
      
    

    
      Cross-sectional epidemiologic study (conducted in 2018) of restricted-access data from the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) (2003-2015) using restricted-access case narratives from suicides and undetermined deaths among adults 55 years and older in 27 states. Participants were all suicides and undetermined deaths (N = 47 759) among persons 55 years and older. Exposure:
      
    

    
      Long-term care cited in the coroner/medical examiner case narrative, whether as a reason for self-harm or the injury location, identified using machine learning natural language processing (NLP) algorithms plus manual review of texts. Main outcomes and measures:
      
    

    
      Number and characteristics (eg, demographics, health history, and means of injury) of suicides associated with LTC. The κ statistic was used to estimate the reliability of the existing NVDRS injury location codes relative to cases identified by the algorithm. Results:
      
    

    
      Among 47 759 persons 55 years and older (median age, 64 years; 77.6% male; 90.0% non-Hispanic white), this study identified 1037 suicide deaths associated with LTC, including 428 among older adults living in LTC, 449 among older adults transitioning to LTC, and 160 otherwise associated with LTC. In contrast, there were only 263 cases coded with the existing NVDRS location code ""supervised residential facility,"" which had poor agreement with cases that the algorithm identified as occurring in LTC (κ statistic, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.26-0.35). Conclusions and relevance:
      
    

    
      Over a 13-year period, approximately 2.2% of suicides among adults 55 years and older were associated with LTC in some manner. Clinicians, administrators, and policy makers should consider ways to promote the mental health and well-being of older adults experiencing functioning limitations and their families. Natural language processing may be a useful way to improve abstraction of variables in the NVDRS.","['1 Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.', '2 Department of Epidemiology, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor.', '3 School of Information, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.']","Briana Mezuk, Tomohiro M Ko, Viktoryia A Kalesnikava, David Jurgens, ",JAMA network open,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31199445
652,Rapid Assessment of Functional Avidity of Tumor-Specific T Cell Receptors Using an Antigen-Presenting Tumor Cell Line Electroporated with Full-Length Tumor Antigen mRNA,"The functional avidity of T-cell receptor (TCR)-engineered T cells towards their cognate epitope plays a crucial role in successfully targeting and killing tumor cells expressing the tumor-associated antigen (TAA). When evaluating in vitro functional T-cell avidity, an important aspect that is often neglected is the antigen-presenting cell (APC) used in the assay. Cell-based models for antigen-presentation, such as tumor cell lines, represent a valid alternative to autologous APCs due to their availability, off-the-shelf capabilities, and the broad range of possibilities for modification via DNA or messenger RNA (mRNA) transfection. To find a valuable model APC for in vitro validation of TAA Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1)-specific TCRs, we tested four different WT1 peptide-pulsed HLA-A2+ tumor cell lines commonly used in T-cell stimulation assays. We found the multiple myeloma cell line U266 to be a suitable model APC to evaluate differences in mean functional avidity (EC50) values of transgenic TCRs following transfection in 2D3 Jurkat T cells. Next, to assess the dose-dependent antigen-specific responsiveness of WT1 TCR-engineered 2D3 T cells to endogenously processed epitopes, we electroporated U266 cells with different amounts of full-length antigen WT1 mRNA. Finally, we analyzed the functional avidity of WT1 TCR-transfected primary CD8 T cells towards WT1 mRNA-electroporated U266 cells. In this study, we demonstrate that both the APC and the antigen loading method (peptide pulsing versus full-length mRNA transfection) to analyze T-cell functional avidity have a significant impact on the EC50 values of a given TCR. For rapid assessment of the functional avidity of a cloned TCR towards its endogenously processed MHC I-restricted epitope, we showcase that the TAA mRNA-transfected U266 cell line is a suitable and versatile model APC.","['1 Tumor Immunology Group, Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Vaccine & Infectious Disease Institute (VAXINFECTIO), Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Antwerp, 2610 Wilrijk, Antwerp, Belgium.', '2 Division of Hematology, Antwerp University Hospital, 2650 Edegem, Antwerp, Belgium.', '3 Center for Cell Therapy & Regenerative Medicine, Antwerp University Hospital, 2650 Edegem, Antwerp, Belgium.']","Diana Campillo-Davo, Maarten Versteven, Gils Roex, Hans De Reu, Sanne van der Heijden, Sébastien Anguille, Zwi N Berneman, Viggo F I Van Tendeloo, Eva Lion, ",Cancers,2020,T-cell functional avidity; Wilms’ tumor 1; cancer immunotherapy; full-length antigen mRNA electroporation; model antigen-presenting cell.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31972992

      The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) spend significant time and resources to track influenza vaccination coverage each influenza season using national surveys. Emerging data from social media provide an alternative solution to surveillance at both national and local levels of influenza vaccination coverage in near real time. Objectives:
      
    

    
      This study aimed to characterise and analyse the vaccinated population from temporal, demographical and geographical perspectives using automatic classification of vaccination-related Twitter data. Methods:
      
    

    
      In this cross-sectional study, we continuously collected tweets containing both influenza-related terms and vaccine-related terms covering four consecutive influenza seasons from 2013 to 2017. We created a machine learning classifier to identify relevant tweets, then evaluated the approach by comparing to data from the CDC's FluVaxView. We limited our analysis to tweets geolocated within the USA. Results:
      
    

    
      We assessed 1 124 839 tweets. We found strong correlations of 0.799 between monthly Twitter estimates and CDC, with correlations as high as 0.950 in individual influenza seasons. We also found that our approach obtained geographical correlations of 0.387 at the US state level and 0.467 at the regional level. Finally, we found a higher level of influenza vaccine tweets among female users than male users, also consistent with the results of CDC surveys on vaccine uptake. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Significant correlations between Twitter data and CDC data show the potential of using social media for vaccination surveillance.

654,Evaluation of T-Cell Responses Against Shared Melanoma Associated Antigens and Predicted Neoantigens in Cutaneous Melanoma Patients Treated With the CSF-470 Allogeneic Cell Vaccine Plus BCG and GM-CSF,"The CSF-470 vaccine consists of lethally-irradiated allogeneic cells derived from four cutaneous melanoma cell lines administered plus BCG and GM-CSF as adjuvants. In an adjuvant phase II study vs. IFN-α2b, the vaccine significantly prolonged the distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) of stages IIB-IIC-III melanoma patients with evidence of the induction of immune responses against vaccine cells. Purpose: The aim of this study was to analyze the antigens against which the immune response was induced, as well as the T-helper profile and lytic ability of immune cells after CSF-470 treatment. Methods: HLA-restricted peptides from tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) were selected from TANTIGEN database for 13 evaluable vaccinated patients. In addition, for patient #006 (pt#006), tumor somatic variants were identified by NGS and candidate neoAgs were selected by predicted HLA binding affinity and similarity between wild type (wt) and mutant peptides. The patient's PBMC reactivity against selected peptides was detected by IFNγ-ELISPOT. T-helper transcriptional profile was determined by quantifying GATA-3, T-bet, and FOXP3 mRNA by RT-PCR, and intracellular cytokines were analyzed by flow cytometry. Autologous tumor cell lysis by PBMC was assessed in an in vitro calcein release assay. Results: Vaccinated patient's PBMC reactivity against selected TAAs derived peptides showed a progressive increase in the number of IFNγ-producing cells throughout the 2-yr vaccination protocol. ELISPOT response correlated with delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction to CSF-470 vaccine cells. Early upregulation of GATA-3 and Foxp3 mRNA, as well as an increase in CD4+IL4+cells, was associated with a low DMFS. Also, IFNγ response against 9/73 predicted neoAgs was evidenced in the case of pt#006; 7/9 emerged after vaccination. We verified in pt# 006 that post-vaccination PBMC boosted in vitro with the vaccine lysate were able to lyse autologous tumor cells. Conclusions: A progressive increase in the immune response against TAAs expressed in the vaccine and in the patient's tumor was induced by CSF-470 vaccination. In pt#006, we demonstrated immune recognition of patient's specific neoAgs, which emerged after vaccination. These results suggest that an initial response against shared TAAs could further stimulate an immune response against autologous tumor neoAgs.","['1 Centro de Investigaciones Oncológicas, Fundación Cáncer, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', '2 IIBIO, UNSAM, San Martín, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', '3 UCLA JCCC-Translational Oncology Research Labs, Los Angeles, CA, United States.', '4 T-Cure Bioscience Inc., Los Angeles, CA, United States.', '5 Centro de Excelencia en Medicina Translacional, Hospital El Cruce, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', '6 Laboratorio de Trombosis Experimental- IMEX-ANM, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', '7 Plataforma Bioinformática, INBioBA-MPSP, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', '8 Department of Health Technology, The Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark.', '9 IIBBA-CONICET, Fundación Instituto Leloir, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', '10 Instituto Alexander Fleming, Buenos Aires, Argentina.']","Enrique Podaza, Ibel Carri, Mariana Aris, Erika von Euw, Alicia Inés Bravo, Paula Blanco, Juan Manuel Ortiz Wilczyñski, Daniel Koile, Patricio Yankilevich, Morten Nielsen, José Mordoh, María Marcela Barrio, ",Frontiers in immunology,2020,CSF-470 allogeneic cell vaccine; cutaneous melanoma; melanoma immunotherapy; neoantigens; tumor associated antigens.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32582212
655,"mRNA Polyplexes with Post-Conjugated GALA Peptides Efficiently Target, Transfect, and Activate Antigen Presenting Cells","Vaccines based on mRNA have emerged as potent systems to elicit CD8+ T cell responses against various cancers and viral infectious diseases. The efficient intracellular delivery of mRNA molecules encoding antigens into the cytosol of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) is still challenging, requiring cell attachment, active uptake, and subsequent endosomal escape. Here, we report a facile approach for the formulation of peptide-functionalized mRNA polyplexes using copper-free click chemistry to promote presentation of mRNA antigen by dendritic cells (DCs). After screening different membrane active peptides, GALA modified mRNA polyplexes (PPx-GALA) with a size around 350 nm and with a slightly negative surface charge (-7 mV), exhibited the highest EGFP-mRNA transfection in RAW 246.7 macrophages (∼36%) and D1 dendritic cells (∼50%) as compared to polyplexes decorated with melittin or LEDE peptides. Interestingly, we found that PPx-GALA enters DCs through sialic acid mediated endo/phagocytosis, which was not influenced by DC maturation. The PPx-GALA formulation exhibited 18-fold higher cellular uptake compared to a lipofectamine mRNA formulation without inducing cytotoxicity. Live cell imaging showed that PPx-GALA that were taken up by endocytosis induced calcein release from endosomes into the cytosol. DCs treated with PPx-GALA containing mRNA encoding for OVA displayed enhanced T cell responses and DC maturation. Collectively, these data provide a strong rationale for further study of this PPx-GALA formulation in vivo as a promising mRNA vaccine platform.","['1 Department of Pharmaceutics, Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences (UIPS) , Utrecht University , 3584CG Utrecht , The Netherlands.', '2 Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, Department of Biomedical Molecular Biology , Ghent University , 9052 Zwijnaarde , Belgium.']","Bo Lou, Stefaan De Koker, Chun Yin Jerry Lau, Wim E Hennink, Enrico Mastrobattista, ",Bioconjugate chemistry,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30188694

At the same time, recently developed health data analytic algorithms struggle with poor quality free-text entered data in these systems. We developed AutoScribe using artificial intelligence-based natural language processing tools to automate these clerical tasks and to output high-quality EMR data. In this article, we describe the benefits and drawbacks of our technology. Furthermore, we describe how we are positioning our company's culture within the existing healthcare system and suggest steps leaders of the system should consider in order to ensure that potentially transformative artificial intelligence-based technologies like ours are optimally adopted.","['1 Mutuo Health Solutions, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']","Noah H Crampton, ",Healthcare management forum,2020 Jan,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31522566

Our goal is to develop a diagnosis support system that makes a diagnosis according to the natural language (NL) inputs provided by patients. To achieve this, two medical dictionaries need to be constructed: one that includes a wide variety of symptom names expressed in NL and another that includes information about the relationship between a disease and its symptoms. Dictionaries will then be used to predict the patient's disease via two developed methods that extract symptom names and disease-symptom relationships. Both methods retrieve sentences using WISDOM X and then apply neural classifiers to them. Our experimental results show that our methods achieved 93.8% and 88.3% in the F1-score, respectively.","['1 Department of Medical Informatics, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Osaka, Japan.', '2 National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Seika, Kyoto, Japan.']","Shoya Wada, Ryu Iida, Kentaro Torisawa, Toshihiro Takeda, Shiro Manabe, Yasushi Matsumura, ",Studies in health technology and informatics,2019,Automated; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Pattern Recognition.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31437958

The field of de novo drug design has been particularly revitalized by adaptation of generative machine learning models from the field of natural language processing. These deep neural network models are trained on recognizing molecular structures and generate new molecular entities without relying on pre-determined sets of molecular building blocks and chemical transformations for virtual molecule construction. Implicit representation of chemical knowledge provides an alternative to formulating the molecular design task in terms of the established, explicit chemical vocabulary. Here, we review de novo molecular design approaches from the field of 'artificial intelligence', focusing on instances of deep generative models, and highlight the prospective application of long short-term memory models to hit and lead finding in medicinal chemistry.","['1 ETH Zurich, Department of Chemistry and Applied Biosciences, Vladimir-Prelog-Weg 4, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.', '2 ETH Zurich, Department of Chemistry and Applied Biosciences, Vladimir-Prelog-Weg 4, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland;, Email: gisbert.schneider@pharma.ethz.ch.']","Francesca Grisoni, Gisbert Schneider, ",Chimia,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31883552

      Clinical care guidelines recommend that newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients at high risk for metastatic spread receive a bone scan prior to treatment and that low risk patients not receive it. The objective was to develop an automated pipeline to interrogate heterogeneous data to evaluate the use of bone scans using a two different Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      Our cohort was divided into risk groups based on Electronic Health Records (EHR). Information on bone scan utilization was identified in both structured data and free text from clinical notes. Our pipeline annotated sentences with a combination of a rule-based method using the ConText algorithm (a generalization of NegEx) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method using word2vec to produce word embeddings. Results:
      
    

    
      A total of 5500 patients and 369,764 notes were included in the study. A total of 39% of patients were high-risk and 73% of these received a bone scan; of the 18% low risk patients, 10% received one. The accuracy of CNN model outperformed the rule-based model one (F-measure = 0.918 and 0.897 respectively). We demonstrate a combination of both models could maximize precision or recall, based on the study question. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Using structured data, we accurately classified patients' cancer risk group, identified bone scan documentation with two NLP methods, and evaluated guideline adherence.

660,The Language of Innovation,"Predicting innovation is a peculiar problem in data science. Following its definition, an innovation is always a never-seen-before event, leaving no room for traditional supervised learning approaches. Here we propose a strategy to address the problem in the context of innovative patents, by defining innovations as never-seen-before associations of technologies and exploiting self-supervised learning techniques. We think of technological codes present in patents as a vocabulary and the whole technological corpus as written in a specific, evolving language. We leverage such structure with techniques borrowed from Natural Language Processing by embedding technologies in a high dimensional euclidean space where relative positions are representative of learned semantics. Proximity in this space is an effective predictor of specific innovation events, that outperforms a wide range of standard link-prediction metrics. The success of patented innovations follows a complex dynamics characterized by different patterns which we analyze in details with specific examples. The methods proposed in this paper provide a completely new way of understanding and forecasting innovation, by tackling it from a revealing perspective and opening interesting scenarios for a number of applications and further analytic approaches.","['1 European Commission, Joint Research Centre (JRC), Seville, Spain.', '2 Institute for Complex Systems, CNR, Rome, Italy.', '3 Sapienza, University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', '4 Museo Storico della Fisica e Centro Studi e Ricerche Enrico Fermi, Compendio del Viminale, Rome, Italy.']","Andrea Tacchella, Andrea Napoletano, Luciano Pietronero, ",PloS one,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32352986

Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), a new language representation model, obtains state-of-the-art results on a wide array of general English NLP tasks. We explore BERT's applicability to medical terminology-related tasks. Utilizing the ""next sentence prediction"" capability of BERT, we show that the Fine-tuning strategy of Transfer Learning (TL) from the BERTBASE model can address a challenging problem in automatic terminology enrichment - insertion of new concepts. Adding a pre-training strategy enhances the results. We apply our strategies to the two largest hierarchies of SNOMED CT, with one release as training data and the following release as test data. The performance of the combined two proposed TL models achieves an average F1 score of 0.85 and 0.86 for the two hierarchies, respectively.","['1 Dept of Computer Science, NJIT, Newark, NJ, USA.']","Hao Liu, Yehoshua Perl, James Geller, ",AMIA ...

662,SMAN: Stacked Multimodal Attention Network for Cross-Modal Image-Text Retrieval,"This article focuses on tackling the task of the cross-modal image-text retrieval which has been an interdisciplinary topic in both computer vision and natural language processing communities. Existing global representation alignment-based methods fail to pinpoint the semantically meaningful portion of images and texts, while the local representation alignment schemes suffer from the huge computational burden for aggregating the similarity of visual fragments and textual words exhaustively. In this article, we propose a stacked multimodal attention network (SMAN) that makes use of the stacked multimodal attention mechanism to exploit the fine-grained interdependencies between image and text, thereby mapping the aggregation of attentive fragments into a common space for measuring cross-modal similarity. Specifically, we sequentially employ intramodal information and multimodal information as guidance to perform multiple-step attention reasoning so that the fine-grained correlation between image and text can be modeled. As a consequence, we are capable of discovering the semantically meaningful visual regions or words in a sentence which contributes to measuring the cross-modal similarity in a more precise manner. Moreover, we present a novel bidirectional ranking loss that enforces the distance among pairwise multimodal instances to be closer. Doing so allows us to make full use of pairwise supervised information to preserve the manifold structure of heterogeneous pairwise data. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our SMAN consistently yields competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Zhong Ji, Haoran Wang, Jungong Han, Yanwei Pang, ",IEEE transactions on cybernetics,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32386178
663,A Semi-Automated Approach for Multilingual Terminology Matching: Mapping the French Version of the ICD-10 to the ICD-10 CM,"The aim of this study was to develop a simple method to map the French International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th revision (ICD-10) with the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10 CM). We sought to map these terminologies forward (ICD-10 to ICD-10 CM) and backward (ICD-10 CM to ICD-10) and to assess the accuracy of these two mappings. We used several terminology resources such as the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus, Bioportal, the latest version available of the French ICD-10 and several official mapping files between different versions of the ICD-10. We first retrieved existing partial mapping between the ICD-10 and the ICD-10 CM. Then, we automatically matched the ICD-10 with the ICD-10-CM, using our different reference mapping files. Finally, we used manual review and natural language processing (NLP) to match labels between the two terminologies. We assessed the accuracy of both methods with a manual review of a random dataset from the results files. The overall matching was between 94.2 and 100%. The backward mapping was better than the forward one, especially regarding exact matches. In both cases, the NLP step was highly accurate. When there are no available experts from the ontology or NLP fields for multi-lingual ontology matching, this simple approach enables secondary reuse of Electronic Health Records (EHR) and billing data for research purposes in an international context.","['1 INSERM, LTSI UMR 1099, F-35000, Rennes France.', '2 CHU Rennes, Centre de Données Cliniques, F-35000, Rennes France.', '3 CHU Martinique, Centre de Données Cliniques, F-97200, Martinique France.', '4 Department of Biomedical Informatics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115 USA.', '5 Université de Lille, CHU Lille, CERIM EA2694, F-59000 Lille, France.']","Emmanuelle Sylvestre, Guillaume Bouzillé, Michael McDuffie, Emmanuel Chazard, Paul Avillach, Marc Cuggia, ",Studies in health technology and informatics,2020,Clinical terminologies; ICD-10; Interoperability; Multilingual matching.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32570338
664,"Neuroanatomical structures supporting lexical diversity, sophistication, and phonological word features during discourse","Deficits in lexical retrieval are commonly observed in individuals with post-stroke aphasia. Successful lexical retrieval is related to lexical diversity, lexical sophistication, and phonological word properties; however, the crucial brain regions supporting these different features are not fully understood. We performed MRI-based lesion symptom mapping in 58 individuals with a chronic left hemisphere stroke to assess how regional damage relates to spoken discourse-extracted measures of lexical diversity, lexical sophistication, and phonological word properties. For discourse transcription and word feature analysis, we used the Computerized Language Analysis (CLAN) program, Stanford Core Natural Language Processing, Irvine Phonotactic Online Dictionary, Lexical Complexity Analyzer, and Gramulator. Lesions involving the left posterior insula and supramarginal gyri and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus were significant predictors of utterances with, on average, lower lexical diversity. Low lexical sophistication was associated with damage to the left pole of the superior temporal gyrus. Production of words with lower phonological complexity (fewer phonemes, higher phonological similarity) was associated with damage to the left supramarginal gyrus. Our findings indicate that discourse-extracted features of lexical retrieval depend on the integrity of specific brain regions involving insular and peri-Sylvian areas. The identified regions provide insight into potentially underlying mechanisms of lexically diverse, sophisticated and phonologically complex words produced during discourse.","['1 Department of Neurology, College of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC 29425, United States of America.

      There is an unmet need for novel treatments, such as drugs or vaccines, adjunctive to or replacing a burdensome life-long gluten-free diet for coeliac disease. The gold standard for successful treatment is a healed small intestinal mucosa, and therefore, the outcome measures in proof-of-concept studies should be based on evaluation of small intestine biopsies. We here evaluated morphometric, immunohistochemical and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression changes in coeliac disease patients challenged with gluten using PAXgene fixed paraffin-embedded biopsies. Methods:
      
    

    
      Fifteen coeliac disease patients were challenged with 4 g of gluten per day for 10 weeks and 24 non-coeliac patients served as disease controls. A wide array of histological and immunohistochemical staining and mRNA-based gene expression tests (RT-qPCR and RNAseq) were carried out. Results:
      
    

    
      Digital quantitative villous height: crypt depth ratio (VH: CrD) measurements revealed significant duodenal mucosal deterioration in all coeliac disease patients on gluten challenge. In contrast, the Marsh-Oberhuber class worsened in only 80% of coeliac patients. Measuring the intraepithelial CD3+ T-lymphocyte and lamina propria CD138+ plasma cell densities simultaneously proved to be a meaningful new measure of inflammation. Stainings for γδ T cells and IgA deposits, where previously frozen samples have been needed, were successful in PAXgene fixed paraffin-embedded samples. Messenger RNA extraction from the same paraffin-embedded biopsy block was successful and allowed large-scale qRT-PCR and RNAseq analyses for gene expression. Molecular morphometry, using the mRNA expression ratio of villous epithelium-specific gene APOA4 to crypt proliferation gene Ki67, showed a similar significant distinction between paired baseline and post-gluten challenge biopsies as quantitative histomorphometry. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Rigorous digitally measured histologic and molecular markers suitable for gluten challenge studies can be obtained from a single paraffin-embedded biopsy specimen. Molecular morphometry seems to be a promising new tool that can be used in situations where assessing duodenal mucosal health is of paramount importance. In addition, the diagnostically valuable IgA deposits were now stained in paraffin-embedded specimens making them more accessible in routine clinics.","['1 Department of Paediatrics, Tampere Centre for Child Health Research, Faculty of Medicine and Health Technology, Tampere University, Tampere University Hospital, Tampere, Finland.', '2 Department of Internal Medicine, Central Finland Central Hospital, Jyväskylä, Finland.', '3 University of Medicine and Pharmacy ""Carol Davila"" and National Institute for Mother and Child Health ""Alessandrescu-Rusescu"", Bucharest, Romania.', '4 Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, Tampere University Hospital, Tampere, Finland.', '5 Laboratory of Cancer Biology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Technology, Tampere University, Tampere, Finland.', '6 Jilab Inc., Tampere, Finland.', '7 Celimmune LLC, Bethesda, MD, USA.', '8 Laboratory of Cancer Biology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Technology, Tampere University, Tampere, Finland. jorma.isola@tuni.fi.', '9 Jilab Inc., Tampere, Finland. jorma.isola@tuni.fi.']","Juha Taavela, Keijo Viiri, Alina Popp, Mikko Oittinen, Valeriia Dotsenko, Markku Peräaho, Synnöve Staff, Jani Sarin, Francisco Leon, Markku Mäki, Jorma Isola, ",BMC gastroenterology,2019,Biopsy; Coeliac disease; Digital histopathology; Gluten; Histology; Immunohistochemistry; Morphometry; PAXgene; RNA; mRNA.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31730447
666,Development of a cardiac-centered frailty ontology,"Background:
      
    

    
      A Cardiac-centered Frailty Ontology can be an important foundation for using NLP to assess patient frailty. Frailty is an important consideration when making patient treatment decisions, particularly in older adults, those with a cardiac diagnosis, or when major surgery is a consideration. Clinicians often report patient's frailty in progress notes and other documentation. Frailty is recorded in many different ways in patient records and many different validated frailty-measuring instruments are available, with little consistency across instruments. We specifically explored concepts relevant to decisions regarding cardiac interventions. We based our work on text found in a large corpus of clinical notes from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) national Electronic Health Record (EHR) database. Results:
      
    

    
      The full ontology has 156 concepts, with 246 terms. It includes 86 concepts we expect to find in clinical documents, with 12 qualifier values. The remaining 58 concepts represent hierarchical groups (e.g., physical function findings). Our top-level class is clinical finding, which has children clinical history finding, instrument finding, and physical examination finding, reflecting the OGMS definition of clinical finding. Instrument finding is any score found for the existing frailty instruments. Within our ontology, we used SNOMED-CT concepts where possible. Some of the 86 concepts we expect to find in clinical documents are associated with the properties like ability interpretation. The concept ability to walk can either be able, assisted or unable. Each concept-property level pairing gets a different frailty score. Each scored concept received three scores: a frailty score, a relevance to cardiac decisions score, and a likelihood of resolving after the recommended intervention score. The ontology includes the relationship between scores from ten frailty instruments and frailty as assessed using ontology concepts. It also included rules for mapping ontology elements to instrument items for three common frailty assessment instruments. Ontology elements are used in two clinical NLP systems. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We developed and validated a Cardiac-centered Frailty Ontology, which is a machine-interoperable description of frailty that reflects all the areas that clinicians consider when deciding which cardiac intervention will best serve the patient as well as frailty indications generally relevant to medical decisions.

667,Early activation of cross-language meaning from phonology during sentence processing,"The current study investigated whether shared phonology across languages activates cross-language meaning when reading in context. Eighty-five bilinguals read English sentences while their eye movements were tracked. Critical sentences contained English members of English-French interlingual homophone pairs (e.g., mow; French homophone mate mot means ""word"") or they contained spelling control words (e.g., mop). Only the meaning of the unseen French homophone mate fit the context (e.g., Hannah wrote another mow/mop on the blackboard for the spelling test). Differences in fixation durations between homophone errors and spelling control errors provided evidence for cross-language activation that extended to semantic representations. When the unseen French homophone was of high frequency, shorter first fixations and gaze durations were observed on English interlingual homophones than on English control words, providing evidence that the French meaning associated with the shared phonology was activated during early stage word identification. Individual differences analyses showed that these effects were larger when bilinguals were using the nontarget language (i.e., French) more regularly in daily life. Results provide evidence that cross-language activation of phonology can be sufficiently strong to activate corresponding semantic representations during single language sentence processing.

To disentangle these two factors, we investigated behavioural and fMRI responses to familiar and unfamiliar languages when observing speech gestures with natural or reversed kinematics. Twenty Italian volunteers viewed silent video-clips of speech shown as recorded (Forward, biological motion) or reversed in time (Backward, non-biological motion), in Italian (familiar language) or Arabic (non-familiar language). fMRI revealed that language (Italian/Arabic) and time-rendering (Forward/Backward) modulated distinct areas in the ventral occipito-temporal cortex, suggesting that visual speech analysis begins in this region, earlier than previously thought. Left premotor ventral (superior subdivision) and dorsal areas were preferentially activated with the familiar language independently of time-rendering, challenging the view that the role of these regions in speech processing is purely articulatory. The left premotor ventral region in the frontal operculum, thought to include part of the Broca's area, responded to the natural familiar language, consistent with the hypothesis of motor simulation of speech gestures.","['1 Laboratory of Neuromotor Physiology, IRCCS Santa Lucia Foundation, Rome, Italy.', '2 Centre of Space BioMedicine and Department of Systems Medicine, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', '3 Data Lake & BI, DOT - Technology, Poste Italiane, Rome, Italy.', '4 Departmental Faculty of Medicine and Surgery, Saint Camillus International University of Health and Medical Sciences, Rome, Italy.', '5 ImpAct Team, Lyon Neuroscience Research Center, Lyon, France.', '6 Laboratory of Neuroimaging, IRCCS Santa Lucia Foundation, Rome, Italy.']","Vincenzo Maffei, Iole Indovina, Elisabetta Mazzarella, Maria Assunta Giusti, Emiliano Macaluso, Francesco Lacquaniti, Paolo Viviani, ",PloS one,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32559213

      We implement 2 different multitask learning (MTL) techniques, hard parameter sharing and cross-stitch, to train a word-level convolutional neural network (CNN) specifically designed for automatic extraction of cancer data from unstructured text in pathology reports. We show the importance of learning related information extraction (IE) tasks leveraging shared representations across the tasks to achieve state-of-the-art performance in classification accuracy and computational efficiency. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      Multitask CNN (MTCNN) attempts to tackle document information extraction by learning to extract multiple key cancer characteristics simultaneously. We trained our MTCNN to perform 5 information extraction tasks: (1) primary cancer site (65 classes), (2) laterality (4 classes), (3) behavior (3 classes), (4) histological type (63 classes), and (5) histological grade (5 classes). We evaluated the performance on a corpus of 95 231 pathology documents (71 223 unique tumors) obtained from the Louisiana Tumor Registry. We compared the performance of the MTCNN models against single-task CNN models and 2 traditional machine learning approaches, namely support vector machine (SVM) and random forest classifier (RFC). Results:
      
    

    
      MTCNNs offered superior performance across all 5 tasks in terms of classification accuracy as compared with the other machine learning models. Based on retrospective evaluation, the hard parameter sharing and cross-stitch MTCNN models correctly classified 59.04% and 57.93% of the pathology reports respectively across all 5 tasks. The baseline models achieved 53.68% (CNN), 46.37% (RFC), and 36.75% (SVM). Based on prospective evaluation, the percentages of correctly classified cases across the 5 tasks were 60.11% (hard parameter sharing), 58.13% (cross-stitch), 51.30% (single-task CNN), 42.07% (RFC), and 35.16% (SVM). Moreover, hard parameter sharing MTCNNs outperformed the other models in computational efficiency by using about the same number of trainable parameters as a single-task CNN. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The hard parameter sharing MTCNN offers superior classification accuracy for automated coding support of pathology documents across a wide range of cancers and multiple information extraction tasks while maintaining similar training and inference time as those of a single task-specific model.","['1 Computational Sciences and Engineering Division, Health Data Sciences Institute, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, USA.', '2 Surveillance Research Program, Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', '3 Louisiana Tumor Registry, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center School of Public Health, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA.', '4 Information Management Services Inc, Calverton, Maryland, USA.']","Mohammed Alawad, Shang Gao, John X Qiu, Hong Jun Yoon, J Blair Christian, Lynne Penberthy, Brent Mumphrey, Xiao-Cheng Wu, Linda Coyle, Georgia Tourassi, ",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2020,cancer pathology reports; convolutional neural network; deep learning; information extraction; multitask learning; natural language processing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31710668
670,Semantic computational analysis of anticoagulation use in atrial fibrillation from real world data,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia and significantly increases stroke risk. This risk is effectively managed by oral anticoagulation. Recent studies using national registry data indicate increased use of anticoagulation resulting from changes in guidelines and the availability of newer drugs. The aim of this study is to develop and validate an open source risk scoring pipeline for free-text electronic health record data using natural language processing. AF patients discharged from 1st January 2011 to 1st October 2017 were identified from discharge summaries (N = 10,030, 64.6% male, average age 75.3 ± 12.3 years). A natural language processing pipeline was developed to identify risk factors in clinical text and calculate risk for ischaemic stroke (CHA2DS2-VASc) and bleeding (HAS-BLED). Scores were validated vs two independent experts for 40 patients. Automatic risk scores were in strong agreement with the two independent experts for CHA2DS2-VASc (average kappa 0.78 vs experts, compared to 0.85 between experts). Agreement was lower for HAS-BLED (average kappa 0.54 vs experts, compared to 0.74 between experts). In high-risk patients (CHA2DS2-VASc ≥2) OAC use has increased significantly over the last 7 years, driven by the availability of DOACs and the transitioning of patients from AP medication alone to OAC. Factors independently associated with OAC use included components of the CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED scores as well as discharging specialty and frailty.

671,Using Natural Language Processing and Sentiment Analysis to Augment Traditional User-Centered Design: Development and Usability Study,"Background:
      
    

    
      Sarcopenia, defined as the age-associated loss of muscle mass and strength, can be effectively mitigated through resistance-based physical activity. With compliance at approximately 40% for home-based exercise prescriptions, implementing a remote sensing system would help patients and clinicians to better understand treatment progress and increase compliance. The inclusion of end users in the development of mobile apps for remote-sensing systems can ensure that they are both user friendly and facilitate compliance. With advancements in natural language processing (NLP), there is potential for these methods to be used with data collected through the user-centered design process. Objective:
      
    

    
      This study aims to develop a mobile app for a novel device through a user-centered design process with both older adults and clinicians while exploring whether data collected through this process can be used in NLP and sentiment analysis. Methods:
      
    

    
      Through a user-centered design process, we conducted semistructured interviews during the development of a geriatric-friendly Bluetooth-connected resistance exercise band app. We interviewed patients and clinicians at weeks 0, 5, and 10 of the app development. Each semistructured interview consisted of heuristic evaluations, cognitive walkthroughs, and observations. We used the Bing sentiment library for a sentiment analysis of interview transcripts and then applied NLP-based latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling to identify differences and similarities in patient and clinician participant interviews. Sentiment was defined as the sum of positive and negative words (each word with a +1 or -1 value). To assess utility, we used quantitative assessment questionnaires-System Usability Scale (SUS) and Usefulness, Satisfaction, and Ease of use (USE). Finally, we used multivariate linear models-adjusting for age, sex, subject group (clinician vs patient), and development-to explore the association between sentiment analysis and SUS and USE outcomes. Results:
      
    

    
      The mean age of the 22 participants was 68 (SD 14) years, and 17 (77%) were female. The overall mean SUS and USE scores were 66.4 (SD 13.6) and 41.3 (SD 15.2), respectively. Both patients and clinicians provided valuable insights into the needs of older adults when designing and building an app. The mean positive-negative sentiment per sentence was 0.19 (SD 0.21) and 0.47 (SD 0.21) for patient and clinician interviews, respectively. We found a positive association with positive sentiment in an interview and SUS score (ß=1.38; 95% CI 0.37 to 2.39; P=.01). There was no significant association between sentiment and the USE score. The LDA analysis found no overlap between patients and clinicians in the 8 identified topics. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Involving patients and clinicians allowed us to design and build an app that is user friendly for older adults while supporting compliance. This is the first analysis using NLP and usability questionnaires in the quantification of user-centered design of technology for older adults.","['1 The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy, Dartmouth, Hanover, NH, United States.', '2 Quantitative Biomedical Sciences Program, Dartmouth, Hanover, NH, United States.', '3 Thayer School of Engineering, Dartmouth, Hanover, NH, United States.', '4 Computer Science, Dartmouth, Hanover, NH, United States.', '5 Department of Kinesiology, University of New Hampshire, Durham, NH, United States.', '6 Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH, United States.', '7 Department of Epidemiology, Dartmouth, Hanover, NH, United States.', '8 Department of Molecular and Systems Biology at Dartmouth, Dartmouth, Hanover, NH, United States.', '9 The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy, Dartmouth, Lebanon, NH, United States.', '10 Department of Medicine, Geisel School of Medicine, Dartmouth, Hanover, NH, United States.', '11 Section of General Internal Medicine, Dartmouth-Hitchcock, Lebanon, NH, United States.']","Curtis Lee Petersen, Ryan Halter, David Kotz, Lorie Loeb, Summer Cook, Dawna Pidgeon, Brock C Christensen, John A Batsis, ",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,2020,aged adults; mobile phone; remote sensing technology; sarcopenia; telemedicine.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32540843
672,Modeling aspects of the language of life through transfer-learning protein sequences,"Background:
      
    

    
      Predicting protein function and structure from sequence is one important challenge for computational biology. For 26 years, most state-of-the-art approaches combined machine learning and evolutionary information. However, for some applications retrieving related proteins is becoming too time-consuming. Additionally, evolutionary information is less powerful for small families, e.g. for proteins from the Dark Proteome. Both these problems are addressed by the new methodology introduced here. Results:
      
    

    
      We introduced a novel way to represent protein sequences as continuous vectors (embeddings) by using the language model ELMo taken from natural language processing. By modeling protein sequences, ELMo effectively captured the biophysical properties of the language of life from unlabeled big data (UniRef50). We refer to these new embeddings as SeqVec (Sequence-to-Vector) and demonstrate their effectiveness by training simple neural networks for two different tasks. At the per-residue level, secondary structure (Q3 = 79% ± 1, Q8 = 68% ± 1) and regions with intrinsic disorder (MCC = 0.59 ± 0.03) were predicted significantly better than through one-hot encoding or through Word2vec-like approaches. At the per-protein level, subcellular localization was predicted in ten classes (Q10 = 68% ± 1) and membrane-bound were distinguished from water-soluble proteins (Q2 = 87% ± 1). Although SeqVec embeddings generated the best predictions from single sequences, no solution improved over the best existing method using evolutionary information. Nevertheless, our approach improved over some popular methods using evolutionary information and for some proteins even did beat the best. Thus, they prove to condense the underlying principles of protein sequences. Overall, the important novelty is speed: where the lightning-fast HHblits needed on average about two minutes to generate the evolutionary information for a target protein, SeqVec created embeddings on average in 0.03 s. As this speed-up is independent of the size of growing sequence databases, SeqVec provides a highly scalable approach for the analysis of big data in proteomics, i.e. microbiome or metaproteome analysis. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Transfer-learning succeeded to extract information from unlabeled sequence databases relevant for various protein prediction tasks. SeqVec modeled the language of life, namely the principles underlying protein sequences better than any features suggested by textbooks and prediction methods. The exception is evolutionary information, however, that information is not available on the level of a single sequence.","['1 Department of Informatics, Bioinformatics & Computational Biology - i12, TUM (Technical University of Munich), Boltzmannstr. 3, 85748, Garching/Munich, Germany. mheinzinger@rostlab.org.', '2 TUM Graduate School, Center of Doctoral Studies in Informatics and its Applications (CeDoSIA), Boltzmannstr. 11, 85748, Garching, Germany. mheinzinger@rostlab.org.', '3 Department of Informatics, Bioinformatics & Computational Biology - i12, TUM (Technical University of Munich), Boltzmannstr. 3, 85748, Garching/Munich, Germany.', '4 TUM Graduate School, Center of Doctoral Studies in Informatics and its Applications (CeDoSIA), Boltzmannstr. 11, 85748, Garching, Germany.', '5 Leibniz Supercomputing Centre, Boltzmannstr. 1, 85748, Garching/Munich, Germany.', '6 TUM Department of Informatics, Software Engineering and Business Information Systems, Boltzmannstr. 1, 85748, Garching/Munich, Germany.', '7 Institute for Advanced Study (TUM-IAS), Lichtenbergstr. 2a, 85748, Garching/Munich, Germany.', '8 TUM School of Life Sciences Weihenstephan (WZW), Alte Akademie 8, Freising, Germany.', '9 Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics & New York Consortium on Membrane Protein Structure (NYCOMPS), Columbia University, 701 West, 168th Street, New York, NY, 10032, USA.']","Michael Heinzinger, Ahmed Elnaggar, Yu Wang, Christian Dallago, Dmitrii Nechaev, Florian Matthes, Burkhard Rost, ",BMC bioinformatics,2019,Deep Learning; Language Modeling; Localization prediction; Machine Learning; Secondary structure prediction; Sequence Embedding; Transfer Learning.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31847804
673,Therapeutic Cancer Vaccination with Ex Vivo RNA-Transfected Dendritic Cells-An Update,"Over the last two decades, dendritic cell (DC) vaccination has been studied extensively as active immunotherapy in cancer treatment and has been proven safe in all clinical trials both with respect to short and long-term side effects. For antigen-loading of dendritic cells (DCs) one method is to introduce mRNA coding for the desired antigens. To target the whole antigenic repertoire of a tumor, even the total tumor mRNA of a macrodissected biopsy sample can be used. To date, reports have been published on a total of 781 patients suffering from different tumor entities and HIV-infection, who have been treated with DCs loaded with mRNA. The majority of those were melanoma patients, followed by HIV-infected patients, but leukemias, brain tumors, prostate cancer, renal cell carcinomas, pancreatic cancers and several others have also been treated. Next to antigen-loading, mRNA-electroporation allows a purposeful manipulation of the DCs' phenotype and function to enhance their immunogenicity. In this review, we intend to give a comprehensive summary of what has been published regarding clinical testing of ex vivo generated mRNA-transfected DCs, with respect to safety and risk/benefit evaluations, choice of tumor antigens and RNA-source, and the design of better DCs for vaccination by transfection of mRNA-encoded functional proteins.","['1 Department of Dermatology, Universitätsklinikum Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, Hartmannstraße 14, 91052 Erlangen, Germany.']","Jan Dörrie, Niels Schaft, Gerold Schuler, Beatrice Schuler-Thurner, ",Pharmaceutics,2020,RNA; clinical trial; dendritic cells; electroporation; immunotherapy; therapeutic vaccination.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31979205

This paper describes a robust method to determine the marital status of patients using structured and unstructured electronic healthcare data from a single academic institution in the United States. We developed and validated a natural language processing pipeline (NLP) for the ascertainment of marital status from clinical notes and compared the performance against two baseline methods: a machine learning n-gram model, and structured data obtained from the electronic health record. Overall our NLP engine had excellent performance on both document-level (F1 0.97) and patient-level (F1 0.95) classification. The NLP Engine had superior performance compared with a baseline machine learning n-gram model. We also observed a good correlation between the marital status obtained from our NLP engine and the baseline structured electronic healthcare data (κ 0.6).","['1 University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', '2 Intermountain Healthcare, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', '3 VA Salt Lake City Healthcare System, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.']","Brian T Bucher, Jianlin Shi, Robert John Pettit, Jeffrey Ferraro, Wendy W Chapman, Adi Gundlapalli, ",AMIA ...

675,A Parser to Support the Definition of Access Control Policies and Rules Using Natural Languages,"As a consequence of the epidemiological transition towards non-communicable diseases, integrated care approaches are required, not solely focused on medical purposes, but also on a range of essential activities for the maintenance of the individuals' quality of life. In order to allow the exchange of information, these integrated approaches might be supported by digital platforms, which need to provide trustful environments and to guarantee the integrity of the information exchanged. Therefore, together with mechanisms such as authentication, logging or auditing, the definition of access control policies assumes a paramount importance. This article focuses on the development of a parser as a component of a platform to support the care of community-dwelling older adults, the SOCIAL platform, to allow the definition of access control policies and rules using natural languages.","['1 Department of Electronic, Telecommunications and Informatics - Institute of Electronics and Informatics Engineering of Aveiro, University of Aveiro, Campo Universitário de Santiago, Aveiro, 3810-193, Portugal.', '2 Department of Electronic, Telecommunications and Informatics - Instituto de Telecomunicações, University of Aveiro, Campo Universitário de Santiago, Aveiro, 3810-193, Portugal.', '3 Department of Medical Sciences - Institute of Electronics and Informatics Engineering of Aveiro, University of Aveiro, Campo Universitário de Santiago, Aveiro, 3810-193, Portugal. npr@ua.pt.']","Marco Rosa, João Paulo Barraca, André Zuquete, Nelson Pacheco Rocha, ",Journal of medical systems,2019,ABAC; Access control; FHIR; Natural language; Parser; XACML.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31872307

677,A Novel Memory-Scheduling Strategy for Large Convolutional Neural Network on Memory-Limited Devices,"Recently, machine learning, especially deep learning, has been a core algorithm to be widely used in many fields such as natural language processing, speech recognition, object recognition, and so on. At the same time, another trend is that more and more applications are moved to wearable and mobile devices. However, traditional deep learning methods such as convolutional neural network (CNN) and its variants consume a lot of memory resources. In this case, these powerful deep learning methods are difficult to apply on mobile memory-limited platforms. In order to solve this problem, we present a novel memory-management strategy called mmCNN in this paper. With the help of this method, we can easily deploy a trained large-size CNN on any memory size platform such as GPU, FPGA, or memory-limited mobile devices. In our experiments, we run a feed-forward CNN process in some extremely small memory sizes (as low as 5 MB) on a GPU platform. The result shows that our method saves more than 98% memory compared to a traditional CNN algorithm and further saves more than 90% compared to the state-of-the-art related work ""vDNNs"" (virtualized deep neural networks). Our work in this paper improves the computing scalability of lightweight applications and breaks the memory bottleneck of using deep learning method on memory-limited devices.","['1 National Laboratory for Parallel and Distributed Processing, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China.', '2 Investigaion Technology Center PLCMC, Beijing, China.']","Shijie Li, Xiaolong Shen, Yong Dou, Shice Ni, Jinwei Xu, Ke Yang, Qiang Wang, Xin Niu, ",Computational intelligence and neuroscience,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31182958
678,Using Twitter Data to Monitor Natural Disaster Social Dynamics: A Recurrent Neural Network Approach with Word Embeddings and Kernel Density Estimation,"In recent years, Online Social Networks (OSNs) have received a great deal of attention for their potential use in the spatial and temporal modeling of events owing to the information that can be extracted from these platforms. Within this context, one of the most latent applications is the monitoring of natural disasters. Vital information posted by OSN users can contribute to relief efforts during and after a catastrophe. Although it is possible to retrieve data from OSNs using embedded geographic information provided by GPS systems, this feature is disabled by default in most cases. An alternative solution is to geoparse specific locations using language models based on Named Entity Recognition (NER) techniques. In this work, a sensor that uses Twitter is proposed to monitor natural disasters. The approach is intended to sense data by detecting toponyms (named places written within the text) in tweets with event-related information, e.g., a collapsed building on a specific avenue or the location at which a person was last seen. The proposed approach is carried out by transforming tokenized tweets into word embeddings: a rich linguistic and contextual vector representation of textual corpora. Pre-labeled word embeddings are employed to train a Recurrent Neural Network variant, known as a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (biLSTM) network, that is capable of dealing with sequential data by analyzing information in both directions of a word (past and future entries). Moreover, a Conditional Random Field (CRF) output layer, which aims to maximize the transition from one NER tag to another, is used to increase the classification accuracy. The resulting labeled words are joined to coherently form a toponym, which is geocoded and scored by a Kernel Density Estimation function. At the end of the process, the scored data are presented graphically to depict areas in which the majority of tweets reporting topics related to a natural disaster are concentrated. A case study on Mexico's 2017 Earthquake is presented, and the data extracted during and after the event are reported.","['1 Instituto Politecnico Nacional, ESIME Culhuacan, Mexico City 04440, Mexico. ahernandezs1325@alumno.ipn.mx.', '2 Instituto Politecnico Nacional, ESIME Culhuacan, Mexico City 04440, Mexico. caaann@gmail.com.', '3 Instituto Politecnico Nacional, ESIME Culhuacan, Mexico City 04440, Mexico. ljaviergv@hotmail.com.', '4 Instituto Politecnico Nacional, ESIME Culhuacan, Mexico City 04440, Mexico. ljaviergv@gmail.com.', '5 Instituto Politecnico Nacional, ESIME Culhuacan, Mexico City 04440, Mexico. ljgv.69@gmail.com.', '6 Department of Computer Science, University of Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, UK. v.f.Sanchez-Silva@warwick.ac.uk.', '7 Group of Analysis, Security and Systems (GASS), Department of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence (DISIA), Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, Office 431, Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM), Calle Profesor José García Santesmases, 9, Ciudad Universitaria, 28040 Madrid, Spain. v.f.Sanchez-Silva@warwick.ac.uk.', '8 Group of Analysis, Security and Systems (GASS), Department of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence (DISIA), Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, Office 431, Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM), Calle Profesor José García Santesmases, 9, Ciudad Universitaria, 28040 Madrid, Spain. javiergv@fdi.ucm.es.']","Aldo Hernandez-Suarez, Gabriel Sanchez-Perez, Karina Toscano-Medina, Hector Perez-Meana, Jose Portillo-Portillo, Victor Sanchez And Luis, Luis Javier García Villalba, ","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019,CRF; LSTM; data mining; geocoding; geoparsing; twitter; word2vec.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30979067

In this paper, we propose a bootstrapping approach for the development of a digital mental health conversational agent (i.e., chatbot). We start from a basic rule-based expert system and iteratively move towards a more sophisticated platform composed of specialized chatbots each aiming to assess and pre-diagnose a specific mental health disorder using machine learning and natural language processing techniques. During each iteration, user feedback from psychiatrists and patients are incorporated into the iterative design process. A survival of the fittest approach is also used to assess the continuation or removal of a specialized mental health chatbot in each generational design. We anticipate that our unique and novel approach can be used for the development of conversational mental health agents with the ultimate goal of designing a smart chatbot that delivers evidence-based care and contributes to scaling up services while decreasing the pressure on mental health care providers.","['1 Information and Computing Technology Division, College of Science and Engineering, Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU), Doha, Qatar.', '2 Community Mental Health Services, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', '3 Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI), Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU), Doha, Qatar.', '4 Global Health and Population, Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health, Harvard University, United States of America.']","Mowafa Househ, Jens Schneider, Kashif Ahmad, Tanvir Alam, Dena Al-Thani, Mohamed Ali Siddig, Luis Fernandez-Luque, Marwa Qaraqe, Ala Alfuquha, Shekhar Saxena, ",Studies in health technology and informatics,2019,Arab world; Mental health; Qatar; anxiety; conversational agent; depression.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31349309
680,Information Theory and Medical Decision Making,"Information theory has gained application in a wide range of disciplines, including statistical inference, natural language processing, cryptography and molecular biology. However, its usage is less pronounced in medical science. In this chapter, we illustrate a number of approaches that have been taken to applying concepts from information theory to enhance medical decision making. We start with an introduction to information theory itself, and the foundational concepts of information content and entropy. We then illustrate how relative entropy can be used to identify the most informative test at a particular stage in a diagnosis. In the case of a binary outcome from a test, Shannon entropy can be used to identify the range of values of test results over which that test provides useful information about the patient's state. This, of course, is not the only method that is available, but it can provide an easily interpretable visualization. The chapter then moves on to introduce the more advanced concepts of conditional entropy and mutual information and shows how these can be used to prioritise and identify redundancies in clinical tests. Finally, we discuss the experience gained so far and conclude that there is value in providing an informed foundation for the broad application of information theory to medical decision making.","['1 Department of Computer Science, University of Surrey, United Kingdom.']","Paul Krause, ",Studies in health technology and informatics,2019,Conditional entropy; Medical diagnosis; Mutual information; Relative entropy; Shannon entropy.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31411150

We created three predictive models by combining these two techniques for the cohort of 1,629 patients from six hosptials using structured data along with their 136,963 clinical notes till their index admission, stored in the EMR system over five years. The AUCs for structured and combined models were very close (0.6494 and 0.6447) and that for the unstructured model was 0.5219.

682,Sarcosine promotes trafficking of dendritic cells and improves efficacy of anti-tumor dendritic cell vaccines via CXC chemokine family signaling,"Background:
      
    

    
      Dendritic cell (DC) vaccine efficacy is directly related to the efficiency of DC migration to the lymph node after delivery to the patient. We discovered that a naturally occurring metabolite, sarcosine, increases DC migration in human and murine cells resulting in significantly improved anti-tumor efficacy. We hypothesized that sarcosine induced cell migration was due to chemokine signaling. Methods:
      
    

    
      DCs were harvested from the bone marrow of wild type C57BL/6 mice and electroporated with tumor messenger RNA (mRNA). Human DCs were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). DCs were treated with 20 mM of sarcosine. Antigen specific T cells were isolated from transgenic mice and injected intravenously into tumor bearing mice. DC vaccines were delivered via intradermal injection. In vivo migration was evaluated by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy. Gene expression in RNA was investigated in DCs via RT-PCR and Nanostring. Results:
      
    

    
      Sarcosine significantly increased human and murine DC migration in vitro. In vivo sarcosine-treated DCs had significantly increased migration to both the lymph nodes and spleens after intradermal delivery in mice. Sarcosine-treated DC vaccines resulted in significantly improved tumor control in a B16F10-OVA tumor flank model and improved survival in an intracranial GL261-gp100 glioma model. Gene expression demonstrated an upregulation of CXCR2, CXCL3 and CXCL1 in sarcosine- treated DCs. Further metabolic analysis demonstrated the up-regulation of cyclooxygenase-1 and Pik3cg. Sarcosine induced migration was abrogated by adding the CXCR2 neutralizing antibody in both human and murine DCs. CXCR2 neutralizing antibody also removed the survival benefit of sarcosine-treated DCs in the tumor models. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Sarcosine increases the migration of murine and human DCs via the CXC chemokine pathway. This platform can be utilized to improve existing DC vaccine strategies.","['1 Preston A.

683,Chinese Clinical Named Entity Recognition Using Residual Dilated Convolutional Neural Network With Conditional Random Field,"Clinical named entity recognition (CNER) is a fundamental and crucial task for clinical and translation research. In recent years, deep learning methods have achieved significant success in CNER tasks. However, these methods depend greatly on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which maintain a vector of hidden activations that are propagated through time, thus causing too much time to train models. In this paper, we propose a residual dilated convolutional neural network with the conditional random field (RD-CNN-CRF) for the Chinese CNER, which makes the model asynchronous in computation and thus speeding up the training period dramatically. To be more specific, Chinese characters and dictionary features are first projected into dense vector representations, then they are fed into the residual dilated convolutional neural network to capture contextual features. Finally, a conditional random field is employed to capture dependencies between neighboring tags and obtain the optimal tag sequence for the entire sequence.

Named entity recognition (NER) and medical relation extraction (MRE) are two basic tasks of MKE. This study aims to improve the recognition accuracy of these two tasks by exploring deep learning methods. Methods This study discussed and built two application scenes of bidirectional long short-term memory combined conditional random field (BiLSTM-CRF) model for NER and MRE tasks. In the data preprocessing of both tasks, a GloVe word embedding model was used to vectorize words. In the NER task, a sequence labeling strategy was used to classify each word tag by the joint probability distribution through the CRF layer. In the MRE task, the medical entity relation category was predicted by transforming the classification problem of a single entity into a sequence classification problem and linking the feature combinations between entities also through the CRF layer. Results Through the validation on the I2B2 2010 public dataset, the BiLSTM-CRF models built in this study got much better results than the baseline methods in the two tasks, where the F1-measure was up to 0.88 in NER task and 0.78 in MRE task. Moreover, the model converged faster and avoided problems such as overfitting. Conclusion This study proved the good performance of deep learning on medical knowledge extraction. It also verified the feasibility of the BiLSTM-CRF model in different application scenarios, laying the foundation for the subsequent work in the EMR field.","['1 Engineering Research Center of Mobile Health Management, Ministry of Education, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou 311121, China.']","Pei-Lin Li, Zhen-Ming Yuan, We-Nbo Tu, Kai Yu, Dong-Xin Lu, ",Chinese medical sciences journal = Chung-kuo i hsueh k'o hsueh tsa chih,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31315754
685,NF-κB activation triggers NK-cell stimulation by monocyte-derived dendritic cells,"Background:
      
    

    
      In therapeutic cancer vaccination, monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) efficiently activate specific T-cell responses; however, optimizing the activation of innate immune cells could support and improve the antitumor effects. A major disadvantage of moDCs matured with the standard cytokine cocktail (consisting of IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα, and PGE2) is their inability to secrete IL-12p70. IL-12 prominently activates natural killer (NK) cells, which are crucial in innate antitumor immunity, as they act as helper cells for the induction of a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response and are also able to directly kill the tumor.

      Previously we have shown that triggering the NF-κB pathway in moDCs by transfection of mRNA encoding constitutively active IKKβ (caIKKβ) led to IL-12p70 secretion and improved the dendritic cells' capability to activate and expand CTLs with a memory-like phenotype. In this study, we examined whether such dendritic cells could activate autologous NK cells. Results:
      
    

    
      moDCs matured with the standard cytokine cocktail followed by transfection with the caIKKβ-RNA were able to activate autologous NK cells, detected by the upregulation of CD54, CD69, and CD25 on the NK cells, their ability to secrete IFNγ, and their high lytic activity. Moreover, the ability of NK-cell activation was not diminished by simultaneous T-cell activation. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The capacity of caIKKβ-DCs to activate both the adaptive and innate immune response indicates an enhanced potential for clinical efficacy.","['1 Institute of Medical Immunology, Martin-Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle (Saale), Germany.', '2 Department of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', '3 Department of Dermatology, Universitätsklinikum Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany.', '4 Department of Dermatology, Universitätsklinikum Erlangen, Research Campus, Hartmannstraße 14, Erlangen, 91052, Germany.']","Naomi C Bosch, Reinhard E Voll, Caroline J Voskens, Stefanie Gross, Barbara Seliger, Gerold Schuler, Niels Schaft, Jan Dörrie, ",Therapeutic advances in medical oncology,2019,NF-κB; adoptive cellular immunotherapy; dendritic cells; interleukin-12; natural killer cells.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31853267
686,Using Topic Modeling to Detect and Describe Self-Injurious and Related Content on a Large-Scale Digital Platform,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITBs) are a complex and enduring public health concern. Increasingly, teenagers use digital platforms to communicate about a range of mental health topics. These discussions may provide valuable information that can lead to insights about complex issues like SITBs. However, the field of clinical psychology currently lacks an easy-to-implement toolkit that can quickly gather information about SITBs from online sources. In the present study, we applied topic modeling, a natural language processing technique, to identify SITBs and related themes online, and we validated this approach using human coders. Method:
      
    

    
      We separately used topic modeling software and human coders to identify themes present in text from a popular online Internet support forum for teenagers. We then determined the degree to which results from the software's topic model aligned with themes identified by human coders. Results:
      
    

    
      We found that topic modeling detected SITBs and related themes in online discussions in a way that accurately distinguishes between relevant and irrelevant human-coded themes. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      This approach has the potential to drastically increase our understanding of SITBs and related issues discussed on digital platforms, as well as our ability to identify those at risk for such outcomes.","['1 Department of Psychology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA.']","Peter J Franz, Erik C Nook, Patrick Mair, Matthew K Nock, ",Suicide & life-threatening behavior,2020 Feb,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31264733

The study is conducted in the context of a specific annotation methodology, namely machine-assisted interactive annotation (also known as human-in-the-loop annotation). This methodology requires the ability to freely combine resources from different document repositories, access a wide array of NLP tools that automatically annotate corpora for various linguistic phenomena, and use a sophisticated annotation editor that enables interactive manual annotation coupled with on-the-fly machine learning. We consider three independently developed platforms, each of which utilizes a different model for representing annotations over text, and each of which performs a different role in the process.","['1 UKP Lab, Technical University Darmstadt, 64289 Darmstadt, Germany.', '2 Vassar College, Poughkeepsie, NY 12604-0520, USA.', '3 Database Center for Life Science, Research Organization of Information and Systems, Kashiwa 277-0871, Japan.']","Richard Eckart de Castilho, Nancy Ide, Jin-Dong Kim, Jan-Christoph Klie, Keith Suderman, ",Genomics & informatics,2019 Jun,annotation software; biomedical text mining; interoperability.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31307134

However, resistance to radio‑ and chemotherapy remains one of the major difficulties in the treatment of breast cancer. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to identify novel regimens to overcome treatment resistance in patients with breast cancer. The results of the present study demonstrated that the attenuated Edmonston‑B vaccine strain of the measles virus (MV‑Edm) significantly re‑sensitized breast cancer cells to doxorubicin and ionizing radiation. Mechanistically, MV‑Edm reduced DNA double strand repair efficiency by decreasing the mRNA and protein expression levels of p53‑binding protein 1 and disassembling the non‑homologous end joining (NHEJ) complex. NHEJ deficiency, which was achieved using DNA ligase IV knockout via CRISPR/Cas9, resulted in failure to overcome resistance mediated by MV‑Edm infection. As a result of the significant synergy between attenuated MV and radio‑ or chemotherapy, MV‑Edm provides a novel strategy for the treatment of radio‑ and chemoresistant breast cancer.","['1 Department of Clinical Laboratory, China‑Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin 130028, P.R.

690,An attention-based deep learning model for clinical named entity recognition of Chinese electronic medical records,"Background:
      
    

    
      Clinical named entity recognition (CNER) is important for medical information mining and establishment of high-quality knowledge map. Due to the different text features from natural language and a large number of professional and uncommon clinical terms in Chinese electronic medical records (EMRs), there are still many difficulties in clinical named entity recognition of Chinese EMRs. It is of great importance to eliminate semantic interference and improve the ability of autonomous learning of internal features of the model under the small training corpus. Methods:
      
    

    
      From the perspective of deep learning, we integrated the attention mechanism into neural network, and proposed an improved clinical named entity recognition method for Chinese electronic medical records called BiLSTM-Att-CRF, which could capture more useful information of the context and avoid the problem of missing information caused by long-distance factors. In addition, medical dictionaries and part-of-speech (POS) features were also introduced to improve the performance of the model. Results:
      
    

    
      Based on China Conference on Knowledge Graph and Semantic Computing (CCKS) 2017 and 2018 Chinese EMRs corpus, our BiLSTM-Att-CRF model finally achieved better performance than other widely-used models without additional features(F1-measure of 85.4% in CCKS 2018, F1-measure of 90.29% in CCKS 2017), and achieved the best performance with POS and dictionary features (F1-measure of 86.11% in CCKS 2018, F1-measure of 90.48% in CCKS 2017). In particular, the BiLSTM-Att-CRF model had significant effect on the improvement of Recall. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our work preliminarily confirmed the validity of attention mechanism in discovering key information and mining text features, which might provide useful ideas for future research in clinical named entity recognition of Chinese electronic medical records.

691,Building Cancer Diagnosis Text to OncoTree Mapping Pipelines for Clinical Sequencing Data Integration and Curation,"Precision oncology research seeks to derive knowledge from existing data. Current work seeks to integrate clinical and genomic data across cancer centers to enable impactful secondary use. However, integrated data reliability depends on the data curation method used and its systematicity. In practice, data integration and mapping are often done manually even though crucial data such as oncological diagnoses (DX) show varying accuracy and specificity levels. We hypothesized that mapping of text-form cancer DX to a standardized terminology (OncoTree) could be automated using existing methods (e.g. natural language processing (NLP) modules and application programming interfaces [APIs]). We found that our best-performing pipeline prototype was effective but limited by API development limitations (accurately mapped 96.2% of textual DX dataset to NCI Thesaurus (NCIt), 44.2% through NCIt to OncoTree). These results suggest the pipeline model could be viable to automate data curation. Such techniques may become increasingly more reliable with further development.","['1 University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC.', '2 Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, Winston Salem, NC.', '3 Montefiore Health System, Bronx, NY.', '4 University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Charlotte, NC.']","Adhithya Narayanan, Umit Topaloglu, Javier A Laurini, Franck Diaz-Garelli, ",AMIA Joint Summits on Translational Science proceedings.

692,Deep Learning Approaches Outperform Conventional Strategies in De-Identification of German Medical Reports,"One of the major obstacles for research on German medical reports is the lack of de-identified medical corpora. Previous de-identification tasks focused on non-German medical texts, which raised the demand for an in-depth evaluation of de-identification methods on German medical texts. Because of remarkable advancements in natural language processing using supervised machine learning methods on limited training data, we evaluated them for the first time on German medical reports using our annotated data set consisting of 113 medical reports from the cardiology domain. We applied state-of-the-art deep learning methods using pre-trained models as input to a bidirectional LSTM network and well-established conditional random fields for de-identification of German medical reports. We performed an extensive evaluation for de-identification and multiclass named entity recognition. Using rule based and out of domain machine learning methods as a baseline, the conditional random field improved F2-score from 70 to 93% for de-identification, the neural approach reached 96% in F2-score while keeping balanced precision and recall rates. These results show, that state-of-the-art machine learning methods can play a crucial role in de-identification of German medical reports.","['1 Section of Bioinformatics and Systems Cardiology, Klaus Tschira Institute for Integrative Computational Cardiology, Heidelberg.', '2 Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Heidelberg.', '3 German Center for Cardiovascular Research (DZHK) - Partner site Heidelberg/Mannheim.']","Phillip Richter-Pechanski, Ali Amr, Hugo A Katus, Christoph Dieterich, ",Studies in health technology and informatics,2019,De-Identification; Deep Learning; ELMo; German Medical Admission Notes; LSTM; Machine Learning; Personal Health Information.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31483261
693,Unified Medical Language System resources improve sieve-based generation and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)-based ranking for concept normalization,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Concept normalization, the task of linking phrases in text to concepts in an ontology, is useful for many downstream tasks including relation extraction, information retrieval, etc. We present a generate-and-rank concept normalization system based on our participation in the 2019 National NLP Clinical Challenges Shared Task Track 3 Concept Normalization. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      The shared task provided 13 609 concept mentions drawn from 100 discharge summaries. We first design a sieve-based system that uses Lucene indices over the training data, Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) preferred terms, and UMLS synonyms to generate a list of possible concepts for each mention. We then design a listwise classifier based on the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) neural network to rank the candidate concepts, integrating UMLS semantic types through a regularizer. Results:
      
    

    
      Our generate-and-rank system was third of 33 in the competition, outperforming the candidate generator alone (81.66% vs 79.44%) and the previous state of the art (76.35%). During postevaluation, the model's accuracy was increased to 83.56% via improvements to how training data are generated from UMLS and incorporation of our UMLS semantic type regularizer. Discussion:
      
    

    
      Analysis of the model shows that prioritizing UMLS preferred terms yields better performance, that the UMLS semantic type regularizer results in qualitatively better concept predictions, and that the model performs well even on concepts not seen during training. Conclusions:

Creating plausible but incorrect options for each item poses significant challenges for the content specialist because this task is often undertaken without implementing a systematic method. In the current study, we describe and demonstrate a systematic method for creating plausible but incorrect options, also called distractors, based on students' misconceptions. These misconceptions are extracted from the labeled written responses. One thousand five hundred and fifteen written responses from an existing constructed-response item in Biology from Grade 10 students were used to demonstrate the method. Using a topic modeling procedure commonly used with machine learning and natural language processing called latent dirichlet allocation, 22 plausible misconceptions from students' written responses were identified and used to produce a list of plausible distractors based on students' responses. These distractors, in turn, were used as part of new multiple-choice items.

696,A two-site survey of medical center personnel's willingness to share clinical data for research: implications for reproducible health NLP research,"Background:
      
    

    
      A shareable repository of clinical notes is critical for advancing natural language processing (NLP) research, and therefore a goal of many NLP researchers is to create a shareable repository of clinical notes, that has breadth (from multiple institutions) as well as depth (as much individual data as possible). Methods:
      
    

    
      We aimed to assess the degree to which individuals would be willing to contribute their health data to such a repository. A compact e-survey probed willingness to share demographic and clinical data categories. Participants were faculty, staff, and students in two geographically diverse major medical centers (Utah and New York). Such a sample could be expected to respond like a typical potential participant from the general public who is given complete and fully informed consent about the pros and cons of participating in a research study. Results:
      
    

    
      Two thousand one hundred forty respondents completed the surveys. 56% of respondents were ""somewhat/definitely willing"" to share clinical data with identifiers, while 89% of respondents were ""somewhat (17%)/definitely willing (72%)"" to share without identifiers. Results were consistent across gender, age, and education, but there were some differences by geographical region. Individuals were most reluctant (50-74%) sharing mental health, substance abuse, and domestic violence data. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We conclude that a substantial fraction of potential patient participants, once educated about risks and benefits, would be willing to donate de-identified clinical data to a shared research repository. A slight majority even would be willing to share absent de-identification, suggesting that perceptions about data misuse are not a major concern. Such a repository of clinical notes should be invaluable for clinical NLP research and advancement.","['1 Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York City, NY, 10025, USA.', '2 Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, 84108, USA.', '3 Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, 84108, USA. john.hurdle@utah.edu.']","Chunhua Weng, Carol Friedman, Casey A Rommel, John F Hurdle, ",BMC medical informatics and decision making,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30943963

Two researchers with a medical degree read the transcripts of 44 GP consultations and highlighted the phrases to be used for generating a summary of the consultation. For all consultations, less than 20% of all words in the transcripts were needed for inclusion in the summary. On average, 9.1% of all words in the transcripts, 26.6% of all medical terms, and 27.3% of all speaker turns were highlighted. The results indicate that communication content used for generating a consultation summary makes up a small portion of GP consultations, and automated summarization solutions-such as digital scribes-must focus on identifying the 20% relevant information for automatically generating consultation summaries.","['1 Australian Institute of Health Innovation, Macquarie University, Australia.', '2 Health Information Systems Office, Ministry of Health, Argentina.']","Juan C Quiroz, Liliana Laranjo, Ahmet Baki Kocaballi, Agustina Briatore, Shlomo Berkovsky, Dana Rezazadegan, Enrico Coiera, ",Health informatics journal,2020,Automatic summarization; GP consultation; Pareto principle; clinical conversations; digital scribe; natural language processing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32865113
698,FoodBase corpus: a new resource of annotated food entities,"The existence of annotated text corpora is essential for the development of public health services and tools based on natural language processing (NLP) and text mining. Recently organized biomedical NLP shared tasks have provided annotated corpora related to different biomedical entities such as genes, phenotypes, drugs, diseases and chemical entities. These are needed to develop named-entity recognition (NER) models that are used for extracting entities from text and finding their relations. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are limited annotated corpora that provide information about food entities despite food and dietary management being an essential public health issue. Hence, we developed a new annotated corpus of food entities, named FoodBase. It was constructed using recipes extracted from Allrecipes, which is currently the largest food-focused social network. The recipes were selected from five categories: 'Appetizers and Snacks', 'Breakfast and Lunch', 'Dessert', 'Dinner' and 'Drinks'. Semantic tags used for annotating food entities were selected from the Hansard corpus. To extract and annotate food entities, we applied a rule-based food NER method called FoodIE. Since FoodIE provides a weakly annotated corpus, by manually evaluating the obtained results on 1000 recipes, we created a gold standard of FoodBase. It consists of 12 844 food entity annotations describing 2105 unique food entities. Additionally, we provided a weakly annotated corpus on an additional 21 790 recipes. It consists of 274 053 food entity annotations, 13 079 of which are unique. The FoodBase corpus is necessary for developing corpus-based NER models for food science, as a new benchmark dataset for machine learning tasks such as multi-class classification, multi-label classification and hierarchical multi-label classification. FoodBase can be used for detecting semantic differences/similarities between food concepts, and after all we believe that it will open a new path for learning food embedding space that can be used in predictive studies.","['1 Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, Ss.

699,Nrf2 Negatively Regulates Type I Interferon Responses and Increases Susceptibility to Herpes Genital Infection in Mice,"Herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) is a leading cause of sexually transmitted infections for which no effective vaccines or prophylactic treatment currently exist. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a transcription factor involved in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and has been more recently shown to regulate inflammatory and antiviral responses. Here, we evaluated the importance of Nrf2 in the control of HSV-2 genital infection, and its role in the regulation of HSV-induced innate antiviral immunity. Comparison of antiviral gene expression profile by RNA-sequencing analysis of wild type and Nrf2-mutant (Nrf2 AY/AY ) murine macrophages showed an upregulation at the basal level of the type I interferon-associated gene network. The same basal increased antiviral profile was also observed in the spleen of Nrf2 -/- mice. Interestingly, the lack of Nrf2 in murine cells was sufficient to increase the responsiveness to HSV-derived dsDNA and protect cells from HSV-2 infection in vitro. Surprisingly, there was no indication of an alteration in STING expression in murine cells as previously reported in cells of human origin. Additionally, genetic activation of Nrf2 in Keap1 -/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts increased HSV-2 infectivity and replication. Finally, using an in vivo vaginal herpes infection model, we showed that Nrf2 controlled early innate immune responses to HSV-2 without affecting STING expression levels. Nrf2 -/- mice exhibited reduced viral replication that was associated with higher level of type I interferons in vaginal washes. Nrf2 -/- mice also displayed reduced weight loss, lower disease scores, and higher survival rates than wild type animals. Collectively, these data identify Nrf2 as a negative regulator of the interferon-driven antiviral response to HSV-2 without impairing STING mRNA and protein expression levels in murine cells.","['1 Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus Research Center for Innate Immunology, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.', '2 Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA, United States.']","Camilla Gunderstofte, Marie Beck Iversen, Suraj Peri, Anne Thielke, Siddharth Balachandran, Christian Kanstrup Holm, David Olagnier, ",Frontiers in immunology,2019,HSV; Nrf2; STING; antiviral immunity; genital infection; herpes virus; innate immune responses; type I IFN.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31555293

Evaluation using annotated data at Vanderbilt University Medical Center showed that CLAMP-Cancer could extract diverse types of cancer information with good F-measures (0.80-0.98).

701,Utility of Blood Cultures and Empiric Antibiotics in Febrile Pediatric Hemophilia Patients With Central Venous Access Devices,"Background:
      
    

    
      Children with hemophilia frequently require long-term central venous access devices (CVADs) for regular infusion of factor products. Hemophilia patients are not immunocompromised, but the presence and use of CVADs are associated with infections including bacteremia. Currently, the utility of blood cultures in evaluation of the febrile hemophilia patient with an indwelling CVAD is unknown, nor is optimal empiric antibiotic use. Methods:
      
    

    
      We performed a retrospective cross-sectional study of febrile immunocompetent hemophilia patients with CVADs presenting to a large academic urban pediatric emergency department from 1995 to 2017. We used a natural language processing electronic search, followed by manual chart review to construct the cohort. We analyzed rate of pathogen recovery from cultures of blood in subgroups of hemophilia patients, the pathogen profile, and the reported pathogen susceptibilities to ceftriaxone. Results:
      
    

    
      Natural language processing electronic search identified 181 visits for fever among hemophilia patients with indwelling CVADs of which 147 cases from 44 unique patients met study criteria. Cultures of blood were positive in 56 (38%) of 147 patients (95% confidence interval, 30%-47%). Seventeen different organisms were isolated (10 pathogens and 7 possible pathogens) with Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species as the most common. Thirty-four percent of isolates were reported as susceptible to ceftriaxone. Positive blood cultures were more common in cases involving patients with inhibitors (n = 71) versus those without (n = 76), odds ratio, 7.4 (95% confidence interval, 3.5-15.9).

702,An Olfactory Sensor Array for Predicting Chemical Odor Characteristics from Mass Spectra with Deep Learning,"Machine learning techniques are useful for applications such as electronic nose (e-nose) systems to classify or identify the target odor. In recent years, deep learning is regarded as one of the most powerful machine learning methods. It enables researchers to extract useful features automatically from high-dimensional raw data and has been widely applied to computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing, though little has been reported in the field of olfaction. In this chapter, we describe the procedure to build a deep neural network to predict odor characteristics of chemicals from their mass spectra.","['1 Institute of Innovative Research, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan.', '2 Institute of Innovative Research, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan. nakamoto@nt.pi.titech.ac.jp.']","Yuji Nozaki, Takamichi Nakamoto, ","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2019,Deep learning; Dimensionality reduction; Mass spectrum; Odor character; Predictive model.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31309470

704,Developing a scalable FHIR-based clinical data normalization pipeline for standardizing and integrating unstructured and structured electronic health record data,"Objective:
      
    

    
      To design, develop, and evaluate a scalable clinical data normalization pipeline for standardizing unstructured electronic health record (EHR) data leveraging the HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) specification. Methods:
      
    

    
      We established an FHIR-based clinical data normalization pipeline known as NLP2FHIR that mainly comprises: (1) a module for a core natural language processing (NLP) engine with an FHIR-based type system; (2) a module for integrating structured data; and (3) a module for content normalization. We evaluated the FHIR modeling capability focusing on core clinical resources such as Condition, Procedure, MedicationStatement (including Medication), and FamilyMemberHistory using Mayo Clinic's unstructured EHR data. We constructed a gold standard reusing annotation corpora from previous NLP projects. Results:
      
    

    
      A total of 30 mapping rules, 62 normalization rules, and 11 NLP-specific FHIR extensions were created and implemented in the NLP2FHIR pipeline. The elements that need to integrate structured data from each clinical resource were identified. The performance of unstructured data modeling achieved F scores ranging from 0.69 to 0.99 for various FHIR element representations (0.69-0.99 for Condition; 0.75-0.84 for Procedure; 0.71-0.99 for MedicationStatement; and 0.75-0.95 for FamilyMemberHistory). Conclusion:
      
    

    
      We demonstrated that the NLP2FHIR pipeline is feasible for modeling unstructured EHR data and integrating structured elements into the model. The outcomes of this work provide standards-based tools of clinical data normalization that is indispensable for enabling portable EHR-driven phenotyping and large-scale data analytics, as well as useful insights for future developments of the FHIR specifications with regard to handling unstructured clinical data.","['1 Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.']","Na Hong, Andrew Wen, Feichen Shen, Sunghwan Sohn, Chen Wang, Hongfang Liu, Guoqian Jiang, ",JAMIA open,2019,Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources; data standards; electronic health records; natural language process.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32025655

Best-worst scaling has seen recent use in natural-language processing and psychology to collect lexical semantic norms. In such applications, four items have always been presented on each trial. The present study provides reasoning that values other than 4 might provide better estimates of latent values. The results from simulation experiments and behavioral research confirmed this: Both suggest that, in the general case, six items per trial better reduces errors in the latent value estimates.","['1 Department of Computing Science, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. hollis@ualberta.ca.']","Geoff Hollis, ",Behavior research methods,2020 Apr,Best-worst scaling; Rating scales; Semantic judgment.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31290129

In particular, parallel training sentences are very important for the quality of machine translation systems. While many existing methods have shown encouraging results, they cannot learn various alignment weights in parallel sentences. To address this issue, we propose a novel parallel hierarchical attention neural network which encodes monolingual sentences versus bilingual sentences and construct a classifier to extract parallel sentences. In particular, our attention mechanism structure can learn different alignment weights of words in parallel sentences. Experimental results show that our model can obtain state-of-the-art performance on the English-French, English-German, and English-Chinese dataset of BUCC 2017 shared task about parallel sentences' extraction.","['1 Zhengzhou University of Light Industry, Zhengzhou 453000, China.', '2 Xinjiang Normal University, Urmqi 830011, China.', '3 Xinjiang University of Finance and Economics, Urmqi 830011, China.']","Shaolin Zhu, Yong Yang, Chun Xu, ",Computational intelligence and neuroscience,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32952544
707,Chat Analysis Triage Tool: Differentiating contact-driven vs. fantasy-driven child sex offenders,"Investigating crimes against children, specifically sexual solicitations, are complicated because not all offenders are contact-driven, meaning they want to meet the minor for sex in the physical world; instead, some offenders are fantasy-driven, in that they are more interested in cybersex and role-play. In addition, the sheer volume of cases involving the online sexual solicitation of minors makes it difficult for law enforcement to determine whether an offender is contact-driven vs. fantasy-driven. However, research shows that there are language-based differences between minors and contact-driven offenders vs. fantasy driven-offenders. Thus, we developed the Chat Analysis Triage Tool (CATT), a forensically sound investigative tool that, based on natural language processing methods, analyzes and compares chats between minors and contact-driven vs. non-contract driven offenders. Using an SVM classifier, we were successful in differentiating the classes based on character trigrams. In a matter of seconds, the existing algorithms provide an identification of an offender's risk level based on the likelihood of contact offending as inferred from the model, which assists law enforcement in their ability to triage and prioritize cases involving the sexual solicitation of minors.","['1 Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, United States.

708,Relation Extraction from Clinical Narratives Using Pre-trained Language Models,"Natural language processing (NLP) is useful for extracting information from clinical narratives, and both traditional machine learning methods and more-recent deep learning methods have been successful in various clinical NLP tasks. These methods often depend on traditional word embeddings that are outputs of language models (LMs). Recently, methods that are directly based on pre-trained language models themselves, followed by fine-tuning on the LMs (e.g. the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)), have achieved state-of-the-art performance on many NLP tasks. Despite their success in the open domain and biomedical literature, these pre-trained LMs have not yet been applied to the clinical relation extraction (RE) task. In this study, we developed two different implementations of the BERT model for clinical RE tasks. Our results show that our tuned LMs outperformed previous state-of-the-art RE systems in two shared tasks, which demonstrates the potential of LM-based methods on the RE task.","['1 School of Biomedical Informatics, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, USA.']","Qiang Wei, Zongcheng Ji, Yuqi Si, Jingcheng Du, Jingqi Wang, Firat Tiryaki, Stephen Wu, Cui Tao, Kirk Roberts, Hua Xu, ",AMIA ...

709,Supervised methods to extract clinical events from cardiology reports in Italian,"Clinical narratives are a valuable source of information for both patient care and biomedical research. Given the unstructured nature of medical reports, specific automatic techniques are required to extract relevant entities from such texts. In the natural language processing (NLP) community, this task is often addressed by using supervised methods. To develop such methods, both reliably-annotated corpora and elaborately designed features are needed. Despite the recent advances on corpora collection and annotation, research on multiple domains and languages is still limited. In addition, to compute the features required for supervised classification, suitable language- and domain-specific tools are needed. In this work, we propose a novel application of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for event extraction from medical reports written in Italian. To train and evaluate the proposed approach, we annotated a corpus of 75 cardiology reports for a total of 4365 mentions of relevant events and their attributes (e.g., the polarity). For the annotation task, we developed specific annotation guidelines, which are provided together with this paper. The RNN-based classifier was trained on a training set including 3335 events (60 documents). The resulting model was integrated into an NLP pipeline that uses a dictionary lookup approach to search for relevant concepts inside the text. A test set of 1030 events (15 documents) was used to evaluate and compare different pipeline configurations. As a main result, using the RNN-based classifier instead of the dictionary lookup approach allowed increasing recall from 52.4% to 88.9%, and precision from 81.1% to 88.2%. Further, using the two methods in combination, we obtained final recall, precision, and F1 score of 91.7%, 88.6%, and 90.1%, respectively. These experiments indicate that integrating a well-performing RNN-based classifier with a standard knowledge-based approach can be a good strategy to extract information from clinical text in non-English languages.","['1 Department of Electrical, Computer and Biomedical Engineering, University of Pavia, Via Ferrata 5, 27100 Pavia (PV), Italy.

710,Semantic Integration and Enrichment of Heterogeneous Biological Databases,"Biological databases are growing at an exponential rate, currently being among the major producers of Big Data, almost on par with commercial generators, such as YouTube or Twitter. While traditionally biological databases evolved as independent silos, each purposely built by a different research group in order to answer specific research questions; more recently significant efforts have been made toward integrating these heterogeneous sources into unified data access systems or interoperable systems using the FAIR principles of data sharing. Semantic Web technologies have been key enablers in this process, opening the path for new insights into the unified data, which were not visible at the level of each independent database. In this chapter, we first provide an introduction into two of the most used database models for biological data: relational databases and RDF stores. Next, we discuss ontology-based data integration, which serves to unify and enrich heterogeneous data sources. We present an extensive timeline of milestones in data integration based on Semantic Web technologies in the field of life sciences. Finally, we discuss some of the remaining challenges in making ontology-based data access (OBDA) systems easily accessible to a larger audience. In particular, we introduce natural language search interfaces, which alleviate the need for database users to be familiar with technical query languages. We illustrate the main theoretical concepts of data integration through concrete examples, using two well-known biological databases: a gene expression database, Bgee, and an orthology database, OMA.","['1 ZHAW Zurich University of Applied Sciences, Winterthur, Switzerland. simn@zhaw.ch.', '2 University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland. simn@zhaw.ch.', '3 ZHAW Zurich University of Applied Sciences, Winterthur, Switzerland.', '4 University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', '5 SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Lausanne, Switzerland.']","Ana Claudia Sima, Kurt Stockinger, Tarcisio Mendes de Farias, Manuel Gil, ","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2019,Data integration; Keyword search; Knowledge representation; Ontology-based data access; Query processing; RDF stores; Relational databases.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31278681

We aimed to develop a reliable NLP tool with broad adaptability. During 1996-2016, Kaiser Permanente Northern California performed 401,566 colonoscopies with linked pathology. We randomly sampled 1000 linked reports into a Training Set and developed an NLP tool using SAS® PERL regular expressions. The NLP tool captured five colonoscopy and pathology variables: type, size, and location of polyps; extent of procedure; and quality of bowel preparation. We used a Validation Set (N = 3000) to confirm the variables' classifications using manual chart review as the reference. Performance of the NLP tool was assessed using the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and Cohen's κ. Cohen's κ ranged from 93 to 99%. The sensitivity and specificity ranged from 95 to 100% across all categories. For categories with prevalence exceeding 10%, the PPV ranged from 97% to 100% except for adequate quality of preparation (prevalence 92%), for which the PPV was 65%. For categories with prevalence below 10%, the PPVs ranged from 62% to 100%. NPVs ranged from 94% to 100% except for the ""complete"" extent of procedure, for which the NPV was 73%. Using information from a large community-based population, we developed a transparent and adaptable NLP tool for extracting five colonoscopy and pathology variables.

      Clinicians need accurate and timely information on the impact of treatments on patient outcomes. The electronic health record (EHR) offers the potential for insight into real-world patient experiences and outcomes, but it is difficult to tap into. Our goal was to apply artificial intelligence technology to the EHR to characterize the clinical course of patients with stage III breast cancer. Patients and methods:
      
    

    
      Data from patients with stage III breast cancer who presented between 2013 and 2015 were extracted from the EHR, de-identified, and imported into the IBM Cloud. Specialized natural language processing (NLP) annotators were developed to extract medical concepts from unstructured clinical text and transform them to structured attributes. In the validation phase, these annotators were applied to 19 additional patients with stage III breast cancer from the same period. The resulting data were compared with that in the medical chart (gold standard) for nine key indicators. Results:
      
    

    
      Information was extracted for 50 patients, including tumor stage (94% stage IIIA, 6% stage IIIB), age (28% 50 years or younger, 52% between 51 and 70 years, and 24% older than 70 years), receptor status (84% estrogen receptor positive, 74% progesterone receptor positive), and first treatment (72% surgery, 26% chemotherapy, 2% endocrine). Events in the patient's journey were compiled to create a timeline. For 171 data elements, NLP and the chart disagreed for 41 (24%; 95% CI, 17.8% to 31.1%). With additional manipulation using simple logic, the disagreement was reduced to six elements (3.5%; 95% CI, 1.3% to 7.5%; F1 statistic, 0.9694). Conclusion:

Most existing approaches do not explicitly take into account the facet information of documents for segmentation. Text segmentation and facet annotation are often addressed as separate problems, but they operate in a common input space. This article proposes FTS, which is a novel model for faceted text segmentation via multitask learning (MTL). FTS models faceted text segmentation as an MTL problem with text segmentation and facet annotation. This model employs the bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) network to learn the feature representation of sentences within a document. The feature representation is shared and adjusted with common parameters by MTL, which can help an optimization model to learn a better-shared and robust feature representation from text segmentation to facet annotation. Moreover, the text segmentation is modeled as a sequence tagging task using LSTM with a conditional random fields (CRFs) classification layer. Extensive experiments are conducted on five data sets from five domains: data structure, data mining, computer network, solid mechanics, and crystallography. The results indicate that the FTS model outperforms several highly cited and state-of-the-art approaches related to text segmentation and facet annotation.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Bei Wu, Bifan Wei, Jun Liu, Kewei Wu, Meng Wang, ",IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32894723

      Misspellings in clinical free text present challenges to natural language processing. With an objective to identify misspellings and their corrections, we developed a prototype spelling analysis method that implements Word2Vec, Levenshtein edit distance constraints, a lexical resource, and corpus term frequencies. We used the prototype method to process two different corpora, surgical pathology reports, and emergency department progress and visit notes, extracted from Veterans Health Administration resources. We evaluated performance by measuring positive predictive value and performing an error analysis of false positive output, using four classifications. We also performed an analysis of spelling errors in each corpus, using common error classifications. Results:

716,Associative attention networks for temporal relation extraction from electronic health records,"Temporal relations are crucial in constructing a timeline over the course of clinical care, which can help medical practitioners and researchers track the progression of diseases, treatments and adverse reactions over time. Due to the rapid adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and high cost of manual curation, using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract temporal relations automatically has become a promising approach. Typically temporal relation extraction is formulated as a classification problem for the instances of entity pairs, which relies on the information hidden in context. However, EHRs contain an overwhelming amount of entities and a large number of entity pairs gathering in the same context, making it difficult to distinguish instances and identify relevant contextual information for a specific entity pair. All these pose significant challenges towards temporal relation extraction while existing methods rarely pay attention to. In this work, we propose the associative attention networks to address these issues. Each instance is first carved into three segments according to the entity pair to obtain the differentiated representation initially. Then we devise the associative attention mechanism for a further distinction by emphasizing the relevant information, and meanwhile, for the reconstruction of association among segments as the final representation of the whole instance. In addition, position weights are utilized to enhance the performance. We validate the merit of our method on the widely used THYME corpus and achieve an average F1-score of 64.3% over three runs, which outperforms the state-of-the-art by 1.5%.","['1 School of Computer Science and Technology, Dalian University of Technology, 116024 Dalian, China.', '2 School of Computer Science and Technology, Dalian University of Technology, 116024 Dalian, China.

717,Understanding the spatial dimension of natural language by measuring the spatial semantic similarity of words through a scalable geospatial context window,"Measuring the semantic similarity between words is important for natural language processing tasks. The traditional models of semantic similarity perform well in most cases, but when dealing with words that involve geographical context, spatial semantics of implied spatial information are rarely preserved. Geographic information retrieval (GIR) methods have focused on this issue; however, they sometimes fail to solve the problem because the spatial and textual similarities of words are considered and calculated separately. In this paper, from the perspective of spatial context, we consider the two parts as a whole-spatial context semantics, and we propose a method that measures spatial semantic similarity using a sliding geospatial context window for geo-tagged words. The proposed method was first validated with a set of simulated data and then applied to a real-world dataset from Flickr. As a result, a spatial semantic similarity model at different scales is presented. We believe this model is a necessary supplement for traditional textual-language semantic analyses of words obtained by word-embedding technologies. This study has the potential to improve the quality of recommendation systems by considering relevant spatial context semantics, and benefits linguistic semantic research by emphasising the spatial cognition among words.","['1 School of Resource and Environmental Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', '2 Geospatial Data Science Lab, Department of Geography, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, United States of America.', '3 State Grid Beijing Electric Power Company, Beijing, China.']","Bozhi Wang, Teng Fei, Yuhao Kang, Meng Li, Qingyun Du, Meng Han, Ning Dong, ",PloS one,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32702022

722,Extraction of features from clinical routine data using text mining,"Background:
      
    

    
      Anti-VEGF drugs are currently used to treat macular diseases. This has led to a wealth of additional data, which could help understand and predict treatment courses; however, this information is usually only available in free text form. Objective:
      
    

    
      A retrospective study was designed to analyze how far interpretable information can be obtained from clinical texts by automated extraction. The aim was to assess the suitability of a text mining method that was customized for this purpose. Material and methods:
      
    

    
      Data on 3683 patients were available, including 40,485 discharge letters. Some of the data of interest, e.g. visual acuity (VA), intraocular pressure (IOP) and accompanying diagnoses, were not only recorded textually but also entered in a database and could thus serve as a gold standard for text analysis. The text was analyzed using the Averbis Health Discovery text mining platform. To optimize the extraction task, rule knowledge and a German language technical vocabulary linked to the international medical terminology standard systematized nomenclature of medicine (SNOMED CT) was manually added. Results:
      
    

    
      The correspondence between extracted data and the structured database entries is described by the F1 value. There was agreement of 94.7% for VA, 98.3% for IOP and 94.7% for the accompanying diagnoses. Manual analysis of noncorresponding cases showed that in 50% text content did not match the database content for various reasons. After an adjustment, F1 values 1-3% above the previously determined values were obtained. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Text mining procedures are very well suited for the considered discharge letter corpus and the problem described in order to extract contents from clinical texts in a structured manner for further evaluation.","['1 Klinik und Poliklinik für Augenheilkunde, Universitätsmedizin Greifswald, Greifswald, Deutschland.', '2 Professur Medieninformatik, Hochschule Mittweida, Mittweida, Deutschland.', '3 Institute for Visual and Analytic Computing, Universität Rostock, Rostock, Deutschland.', '4 Klinik für Augenheilkunde, Universitätsklinikum Freiburg, Medizinische Fakultät, Universität Freiburg, Freiburg, Deutschland.', '5 Averbis GmbH, Freiburg, Deutschland.', '6 Averbis GmbH, Freiburg, Deutschland. philipp.daumke@averbis.com.']","Bastian Grundel, Marc-Antoine Bernardeau, Holger Langner, Christoph Schmidt, Daniel Böhringer, Marc Ritter, Paul Rosenthal, Andrea Grandjean, Stefan Schulz, Philipp Daumke, Andreas Stahl, ",Der Ophthalmologe : Zeitschrift der Deutschen Ophthalmologischen Gesellschaft,2020,Decision support systems; Electronic health records; Macular degeneration; Natural language processing; Systematized nomenclature of medicine.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32725541
723,Assisting nurses in care documentation: from automated sentence classification to coherent document structures with subject headings,"Background:
      
    

    
      Up to 35% of nurses' working time is spent on care documentation. We describe the evaluation of a system aimed at assisting nurses in documenting patient care and potentially reducing the documentation workload. Our goal is to enable nurses to write or dictate nursing notes in a narrative manner without having to manually structure their text under subject headings. In the current care classification standard used in the targeted hospital, there are more than 500 subject headings to choose from, making it challenging and time consuming for nurses to use. Methods:
      
    

    
      The task of the presented system is to automatically group sentences into paragraphs and assign subject headings. For classification the system relies on a neural network-based text classification model. The nursing notes are initially classified on sentence level. Subsequently coherent paragraphs are constructed from related sentences. Results:
      
    

    
      Based on a manual evaluation conducted by a group of three domain experts, we find that in about 69% of the paragraphs formed by the system the topics of the sentences are coherent and the assigned paragraph headings correctly describe the topics. We also show that the use of a paragraph merging step reduces the number of paragraphs produced by 23% without affecting the performance of the system. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The study shows that the presented system produces a coherent and logical structure for freely written nursing narratives and has the potential to reduce the time and effort nurses are currently spending on documenting care in hospitals.","['1 Department of Future Technologies, University of Turku, Vesilinnantie 5, Turku, 20500, Finland. hnsmoen@gmail.com.', '2 Department of Future Technologies, University of Turku, Vesilinnantie 5, Turku, 20500, Finland.', '3 University of Turku Graduate School, University of Turku, Hämeenkatu 4, Turku, 20500, Finland.', '4 Department of Nursing Science, University of Turku, Joukahaisenkatu 3-5, Turku, 20520, Finland.', '5 Turku University Hospital, Kiinamyllynkatu 4-8, Turku, 20521, Finland.']","Hans Moen, Kai Hakala, Laura-Maria Peltonen, Hanna-Maria Matinolli, Henry Suhonen, Kirsi Terho, Riitta Danielsson-Ojala, Maija Valta, Filip Ginter, Tapio Salakoski, Sanna Salanterä, ",Journal of biomedical semantics,2020,Electronic health records; Model interpretation; Natural language processing; Neural networks; Nursing documentation; Patient care documentation; Text classification.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32873340
724,Widespread and lateralized social brain activity for processing dynamic facial expressions,"Dynamic facial expressions of emotions constitute natural and powerful means of social communication in daily life. A number of previous neuroimaging studies have explored the neural mechanisms underlying the processing of dynamic facial expressions, and indicated the activation of certain social brain regions (e.g., the amygdala) during such tasks. However, the activated brain regions were inconsistent across studies, and their laterality was rarely evaluated. To investigate these issues, we measured brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging in a relatively large sample (n = 51) during the observation of dynamic facial expressions of anger and happiness and their corresponding dynamic mosaic images. The observation of dynamic facial expressions, compared with dynamic mosaics, elicited stronger activity in the bilateral posterior cortices, including the inferior occipital gyri, fusiform gyri, and superior temporal sulci. The dynamic facial expressions also activated bilateral limbic regions, including the amygdalae and ventromedial prefrontal cortices, more strongly versus mosaics. In the same manner, activation was found in the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and left cerebellum. Laterality analyses comparing original and flipped images revealed right hemispheric dominance in the superior temporal sulcus and IFG and left hemispheric dominance in the cerebellum. These results indicated that the neural mechanisms underlying processing of dynamic facial expressions include widespread social brain regions associated with perceptual, emotional, and motor functions, and include a clearly lateralized (right cortical and left cerebellar) network like that involved in language processing.","['1 Kokoro Research Center, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', '2 Brain Activity Imaging Center, ATR-Promotions, Inc., Kyoto, Japan.', '3 Department of Neurodevelopmental Psychiatry, Habilitation and Rehabilitation, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', '4 Health and Medical Services Center, Shiga University, Hikone, Shiga, Japan.', '5 Faculty of Human Health Science, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', '6 The Organization for Promoting Neurodevelopmental Disorder Research, Kyoto, Japan.']","Wataru Sato, Takanori Kochiyama, Shota Uono, Reiko Sawada, Yasutaka Kubota, Sayaka Yoshimura, Motomi Toichi, ",Human brain mapping,2019 Sep,amygdala; dynamic facial expression; functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); inferior frontal gyrus; laterality; superior temporal sulcus.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31090126

726,Evaluating shallow and deep learning strategies for the 2018 n2c2 shared task on clinical text classification,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Automated clinical phenotyping is challenging because word-based features quickly turn it into a high-dimensional problem, in which the small, privacy-restricted, training datasets might lead to overfitting. Pretrained embeddings might solve this issue by reusing input representation schemes trained on a larger dataset. We sought to evaluate shallow and deep learning text classifiers and the impact of pretrained embeddings in a small clinical dataset. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      We participated in the 2018 National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2) Shared Task on cohort selection and received an annotated dataset with medical narratives of 202 patients for multilabel binary text classification. We set our baseline to a majority classifier, to which we compared a rule-based classifier and orthogonal machine learning strategies: support vector machines, logistic regression, and long short-term memory neural networks. We evaluated logistic regression and long short-term memory using both self-trained and pretrained BioWordVec word embeddings as input representation schemes. Results:
      
    

    
      Rule-based classifier showed the highest overall micro F1 score (0.9100), with which we finished first in the challenge. Shallow machine learning strategies showed lower overall micro F1 scores, but still higher than deep learning strategies and the baseline. We could not show a difference in classification efficiency between self-trained and pretrained embeddings. Discussion:
      
    

    
      Clinical context, negation, and value-based criteria hindered shallow machine learning approaches, while deep learning strategies could not capture the term diversity due to the small training dataset. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Shallow methods for clinical phenotyping can still outperform deep learning methods in small imbalanced data, even when supported by pretrained embeddings.","['1 Institute for Medical Informatics, Statistics and Documentation, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.', '2 CBmed GmbH - Center for Biomarker Research in Medicine, Graz, Austria.']","Michel Oleynik, Amila Kugic, Zdenko Kasáč, Markus Kreuzthaler, ",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2019,data mining; deep learning; machine learning; natural language processing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31512729

However, clinical narratives are known to contain duplicated sections due to clinicians' copy/paste parts of a former report into a new one. In this study, we aim at evaluating the duplications found within patient records in more than 650,000 French clinical narratives. We adapted a method to identify efficiently duplicated zones in a reasonable time. We evaluated the potential impact of duplications in two use cases: the presence of (i) treatments and/or (ii) relative dates. We identified an average rate of duplication of 33%. We found that 20% of the document contained drugs mentioned only in duplicated zones and that 1.45% of the document contained mentions of relative dates in duplicated zone, that could potentially lead to erroneous interpretation.

      Accurate anesthesiology procedure code data are essential to quality improvement, research, and reimbursement tasks within anesthesiology practices. Advanced data science techniques, including machine learning and natural language processing, offer opportunities to develop classification tools for Current Procedural Terminology codes across anesthesia procedures. Methods:
      
    

    
      Models were created using a Train/Test dataset including 1,164,343 procedures from 16 academic and private hospitals. Five supervised machine learning models were created to classify anesthesiology Current Procedural Terminology codes, with accuracy defined as first choice classification matching the institutional-assigned code existing in the perioperative database. The two best performing models were further refined and tested on a Holdout dataset from a single institution distinct from Train/Test. A tunable confidence parameter was created to identify cases for which models were highly accurate, with the goal of at least 95% accuracy, above the reported 2018 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (Baltimore, Maryland) fee-for-service accuracy. Actual submitted claim data from billing specialists were used as a reference standard. Results:
      
    

    
      Support vector machine and neural network label-embedding attentive models were the best performing models, respectively, demonstrating overall accuracies of 87.9% and 84.2% (single best code), and 96.8% and 94.0% (within top three). Classification accuracy was 96.4% in 47.0% of cases using support vector machine and 94.4% in 62.2% of cases using label-embedding attentive model within the Train/Test dataset. In the Holdout dataset, respective classification accuracies were 93.1% in 58.0% of cases and 95.0% among 62.0%. The most important feature in model training was procedure text. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Through application of machine learning and natural language processing techniques, highly accurate real-time models were created for anesthesiology Current Procedural Terminology code classification. The increased processing speed and a priori targeted accuracy of this classification approach may provide performance optimization and cost reduction for quality improvement, research, and reimbursement tasks reliant on anesthesiology procedure codes.","['1 From the Department of Anesthesiology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan (M.L.B., M.R.M., J.V., X.T., B.L., D.A.C., N.S., S.K., L.S.)

      Biomedical literature is one of the most relevant sources of information for knowledge mining in the field of Bioinformatics. In spite of English being the most widely addressed language in the field; in recent years, there has been a growing interest from the natural language processing community in dealing with languages other than English. However, the availability of language resources and tools for appropriate treatment of non-English texts is lacking behind. Our research is concerned with the semantic annotation of biomedical texts in the Spanish language, which can be considered an under-resourced language where biomedical text processing is concerned. Results:
      
    

    
      We have carried out experiments to assess the effectiveness of several methods for the automatic annotation of biomedical texts in Spanish. One approach is based on the linguistic analysis of Spanish texts and their annotation using an information retrieval and concept disambiguation approach. A second method takes advantage of a Spanish-English machine translation process to annotate English documents and transfer annotations back to Spanish. A third method takes advantage of the combination of both procedures. Our evaluation shows that a combined system has competitive advantages over the two individual procedures.

731,"An ontological framework for the formalization, organization and usage of TCM-Knowledge","Background:
      
    

    
      The traditional Chinese Medicine Language System (TCMLS) is a large-scale terminology system, developed from 2002 on by the Institute of Information of Traditional Chinese Medicine (IITCM). Until now, more than 120,000 concepts, 300,000 terms and 1.27 million semantic relational links are included. Its top-level framework, called TCMLS-semantic network (SN), provides an important basis for the standardization and mapping of traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) terminology systems. Though, many data produced and stored in TCMLS have poor quality for historical reasons or because of human factors. There is a large number of classification errors or inconsistent expressions of terms remained in the current TCMLS- SN, which hamper an efficient utilization of the data stored in TCMLS in practical applications. Methods:
      
    

    
      We start with analyzing the technical specification based on TCMLS, considering some obvious classification errors and problems of ambiguity of semantic expressions in TCMLS-SN, followed with using a top-down approach for building a middle level ontology which is based on the framework General Formal Ontology (GFO), take into account the compatibility with TCM related concepts, turn out the results of a modification of the current TCMLS-SN, called GFO-TCM. Results:
      
    

    
      Through comparison with TCMLS-SN, according to viewpoints of GFO, some semantic types and relations were reconstructed within GFO-TCM. We propose a middle level ontology for TCMLS which may support entailment and ensure coherence, we also draw out a mapping which possess a more reasonable framework with a unified semantic criterion, it is application scenarios oriented and can be further updated and extended. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The goal is to construct a formal middle-level ontology that is compatible with both the traditional medical terminology system and modern medical terminology standards. it is intended to satisfy functional requirements which are relevant for natural language processing, information extraction, semantic retrieval, clinical decision support in the field of traditional Chinese medicine.

735,Automating the search for a patent's prior art with a full text similarity search,"More than ever, technical inventions are the symbol of our society's advance. Patents guarantee their creators protection against infringement. For an invention being patentable, its novelty and inventiveness have to be assessed. Therefore, a search for published work that describes similar inventions to a given patent application needs to be performed. Currently, this so-called search for prior art is executed with semi-automatically composed keyword queries, which is not only time consuming, but also prone to errors. In particular, errors may systematically arise by the fact that different keywords for the same technical concepts may exist across disciplines. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed, where the full text of a given patent application is compared to existing patents using machine learning and natural language processing techniques to automatically detect inventions that are similar to the one described in the submitted document. Various state-of-the-art approaches for feature extraction and document comparison are evaluated. In addition to that, the quality of the current search process is assessed based on ratings of a domain expert. The evaluation results show that our automated approach, besides accelerating the search process, also improves the search results for prior art with respect to their quality.","['1 Machine Learning Group, Technische Universität Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', '2 Pfenning, Meinig & Partner mbB, Berlin, Germany.', '3 Department of Brain and Cognitive Engineering, Korea University, Anam-dong, Seongbuk-gu, Seoul 02841, Korea.', '4 Max-Planck-Institut für Informatik, Saarbrücken, Germany.']","Lea Helmers, Franziska Horn, Franziska Biegler, Tim Oppermann, Klaus-Robert Müller, ",PloS one,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30830911

Yet, only few works have analyzed text generated by LSTMs in order to quantitatively evaluate to which extent such artificial texts resemble those generated by humans. We compared the statistical structure of LSTM-generated language to that of written natural language, and to those produced by Markov models of various orders. In particular, we characterized the statistical structure of language by assessing word-frequency statistics, long-range correlations, and entropy measures. Our main finding is that while both LSTM- and Markov-generated texts can exhibit features similar to real ones in their word-frequency statistics and entropy measures, LSTM-texts are shown to reproduce long-range correlations at scales comparable to those found in natural language. Moreover, for LSTM networks, a temperature-like parameter controlling the generation process shows an optimal value-for which the produced texts are closest to real language-consistent across different statistical features investigated.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Marco Lippi, Marcelo A Montemurro, Mirko Degli Esposti, Giampaolo Cristadoro, ",IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems,2019 Nov,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30951479
737,microRNA modified tumor-derived exosomes as novel tools for maturation of dendritic cells,"Tumor-derived exosomes (TEX) are known by their immune suppression effects as well as initiation mediators in cancer progression and metastasis. Meanwhile, they are appropriate sources to induce immunity against tumor cells, as consist of tumor specific and associated antigens. The aim of the current study is modifying TEX with microRNA miR-155, miR-142, and let-7i, to enhance their immune stimulation ability and induce potent dendritic cells (DC). For this, exosomes were isolated from mouse mammalian breast cancer cell line; 4T1, and subjected to miR-155, miR-142, and let-7i by electroporation. Immature DCs were generated from mouse bone marrow in the presence of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). To mature DCs, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), TEX, and modified TEX were used. The expression level of miRNAs and their target genes (IL-6, IL-17, IL-1b, TGFβ, SOCS1, KLRK1, IFNγ, and TLR4) was determined. TEX were nanovesicles with spheroid morphology which expressed CD81, CD63, and TSG101, as exosome markers, at protein level. MHCII, CD80, and CD40 as maturation markers were assessed by flow cytometry. Overexpression of miRNAs were confirmed in exosomes and mDCs. Up and downregulation of target genes confirmed the gene network in DC maturation. We found that Let-7i could efficiently induce the DC maturation, as well as miR-142 and miR-155 have enhancing effects. These findings reveal that the modified TEX would be a hopeful cell-free vaccine for the cancer treatment.","['1 Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.', '2 Department of Stem Cells and Developmental Biology, Cell Sciences Research Center, Royan Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Technology, ACECR, Tehran, Iran.']","Adeleh Taghikhani, Zuhair Mohammad Hassan, Marzieh Ebrahimi, Seyyed-Mohammad Moazzeni, ",Journal of cellular physiology,2019 Jun,dendritic cell maturation; microRNA; tumor-derived exosomes (TEX).,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30362582
738,MCN: A comprehensive corpus for medical concept normalization,"Normalization of clinical text involves linking different ways of talking about the same clinical concept to the same term in the standardized vocabulary. To date, very few annotated corpora for normalization have been available, and existing corpora so far have been limited in scope and only dealt with the normalization of diseases and disorders. In this paper, we describe the annotation methodology we developed in order to create a new manually annotated wide-coverage corpus for clinical concept normalization, the Medical Concept Normalization (MCN) corpus. In order to ensure wider coverage, we applied normalization to the text spans corresponding to the medical problems, treatments, and tests in the named entity corpus released for the fourth i2b2/VA shared task. In contrast to previous annotation efforts, we do not assign multiple concept labels to the named entities that do not map to a unique concept in the controlled vocabulary. Nor do we leave that named entity without a concept label. Instead, our normalization method that splits such named entities, resolving some of the core ambiguity issues. Lastly, we supply a sieve-based normalization baseline for MCN which combines MetaMap with multiple exact match components. The resulting corpus consists of 100 discharge summaries and provides normalization for the total of 10,919 concept mentions, using 3792 unique concepts from two controlled vocabularies. Our inter-annotator agreement is 67.69% pre-adjudication and 74.20% post-adjudication. Our sieve-based normalization baseline for MCN achieves 77% accuracy in cross-validation. We also detail the challenges of creating a normalization corpus, including the limitations deriving from both the mention span selection and the ambiguity and inconsistency within the current standardized terminologies. In order to facilitate the development of improved concept normalization methods, the MCN corpus will be publicly released to the research community in a shared task in 2019.","['1 Computer Science Department, University of Massachusetts Lowell, MA, USA.

739,"Machine Vision Methods, Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning Algorithms for Automated Dispersion Plot Analysis and Chemical Identification from Complex Mixtures","Gas-phase trace chemical detection techniques such as ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) and differential mobility spectrometry (DMS) can be used in many settings, such as evaluating the health condition of patients or detecting explosives at airports. These devices separate chemical compounds in a mixture and provide information to identify specific chemical species of interest. Further, these types of devices operate well in both controlled lab environments and in-field applications. Frequently, the commercial versions of these devices are highly tailored for niche applications (e.g., explosives detection) because of the difficulty involved in reconfiguring instrumentation hardware and data analysis software algorithms. In order for researchers to quickly adapt these tools for new purposes and broader panels of chemical targets, it is critical to develop new algorithms and methods for generating libraries of these sensor responses. Microelectromechanical system (MEMS) technology has been used to fabricate DMS devices that miniaturize the platforms for easier deployment; however, concurrent advances in advanced data analytics are lagging. DMS generates complex three-dimensional dispersion plots for both positive and negative ions in a mixture. Although simple spectra of single chemicals are straightforward to interpret (both visually and via algorithms), it is exceedingly challenging to interpret dispersion plots from complex mixtures with many chemical constituents. This study uses image processing and computer vision steps to automatically identify features from DMS dispersion plots. We used the bag-of-words approach adapted from natural language processing and information retrieval to cluster and organize these features. Finally, a support vector machine (SVM) learning algorithm was trained using these features in order to detect and classify specific compounds in these represented conceptualized data outputs. Using this approach, we successfully maintain a high level of correct chemical identification, even when a gas mixture increases in complexity with interfering chemicals present.","['1 Department of Internal Medicine , University of California, Davis , 4150 V Street, Suite 3400 , Sacramento , California 95817 , United States.', '2 VA Northern California Health Care System , 10535 Hospital Way , Mather , California 95655 , United States.']","Danny Yeap, Paul T Hichwa, Maneeshin Y Rajapakse, Daniel J Peirano, Mitchell M McCartney, Nicholas J Kenyon, Cristina E Davis, ",Analytical chemistry,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31310101
740,A clustering approach for topic filtering within systematic literature reviews,"Within a systematic literature review (SLR), researchers are confronted with vast amounts of articles from scientific databases, which have to be manually evaluated regarding their relevance for a certain field of observation. The evaluation and filtering phase of prevalent SLR methodologies is therefore time consuming and hardly expressible to the intended audience. The proposed method applies natural language processing (NLP) on article meta data and a k-means clustering algorithm to automatically convert large article corpora into a distribution of focal topics. This allows efficient filtering as well as objectifying the process through the discussion of the clustering results. Beyond that, it allows to quickly identify scientific communities and therefore provides an iterative perspective for the so far linear SLR methodology.•NLP and k-means clustering to filter large article corpora during systematic literature reviews.•Automated clustering allows filtering very efficiently as well as effectively compared to manual selection.•Presentation and discussion of the clustering results helps to objectify the nontransparent filtering step in systematic literature reviews.","['1 Chair for International Production Engineering and Management, University of Siegen.']","Tim Weißer, Till Saßmannshausen, Dennis Ohrndorf, Peter Burggräf, Johannes Wagner, ",MethodsX,2020,Clustering; Literature filtering; Systematic literature review.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32195145
741,Aggregation and analysis of indication-symptom relationships for drugs approved in the USA,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      Drug indications and disease symptoms often confound adverse event reports in real-world datasets, including electronic health records and reports in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). A thorough, standardized set of indications and symptoms is needed to identify these confounders in such datasets for drug research and safety assessment. The aim of this study is to create a comprehensive list of drug-indication associations and disease-symptom associations using multiple resources, including existing databases and natural language processing. Methods:
      
    

    
      Drug indications for drugs approved in the USA were extracted from two databases, RxNorm and Side Effect Resource (SIDER). Symptoms for these indications were extracted from MedlinePlus and using natural language processing from PubMed abstracts. Results:
      
    

    
      A total of 1361 unique drugs, 1656 unique indications, and 2201 unique symptoms were extracted from a wide variety of MedDRA System Organ Classes. Text-mining precision was maximized at 0.65 by examining Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) scores of the disease-symptom associations. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The drug-indication associations and disease-symptom associations collected in this study may be useful in identifying confounders in other datasets, such as safety reports. With further refinement and additional drugs, indications, and symptoms, this dataset may become a quality resource for disease symptoms.","['1 Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', '2 Division of Applied Regulatory Science, US Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD, USA.', ""3 Emergency Department, Phoenix Children's Hospital, Phoenix, AZ, USA."", '4 Division of Applied Regulatory Science, US Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD, USA.

742,Extracting lung function measurements to enhance phenotyping of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in an electronic health record using automated tools,"Background:
      
    

    
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with poor quality of life, hospitalization and mortality. COPD phenotype includes using pulmonary function tests to determine airflow obstruction from the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1):forced vital capacity. FEV1 is a commonly used value for severity but is difficult to identify in structured electronic health record (EHR) data. Data source and methods:
      
    

    
      Using the Microsoft SQL Server's full-text search feature and string functions supporting regular-expression-like operations, we developed an automated tool to extract FEV1 values from progress notes to improve ascertainment of FEV1 in EHR in the Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS). Results:
      
    

    
      The automated tool increased quantifiable FEV1 values from 12,425 to 16,274 (24% increase in numeric FEV1). Using chart review as the reference, positive predictive value of the tool was 99% (95% Confidence interval: 98.2-100.0%) for identifying quantifiable FEV1 values and a recall value of 100%, yielding an F-measure of 0.99. The tool correctly identified FEV1 measurements in 95% of cases. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      A SQL-based full text search of clinical notes for quantifiable FEV1 is efficient and improves the number of values available in VA data. Future work will examine how these methods can improve phenotyping of patients with COPD in the VA.","['1 Department of Medicine, VA Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven, CT, United States of America.', '2 Department of Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, United States of America.', '3 Division of General Internal Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, United States of America.', '4 Department of Emergency Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, United States of America.', '5 Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.', '6 Department of Medicine, VA Puget Sound Health Care System and University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States of America.', '7 Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA, United States of America.']","Kathleen M Akgün, Keith Sigel, Kei-Hoi Cheung, Farah Kidwai-Khan, Alex K Bryant, Cynthia Brandt, Amy Justice, Kristina Crothers, ",PloS one,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31945115
743,CD4 + T cell help creates memory CD8 + T cells with innate and help-independent recall capacities,"CD4+ T cell help is required for the generation of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) memory. Here, we use genome-wide analyses to show how CD4+ T cell help delivered during priming promotes memory differentiation of CTLs. Help signals enhance IL-15-dependent maintenance of central memory T (TCM) cells. More importantly, help signals regulate the size and function of the effector memory T (TEM) cell pool. Helped TEM cells produce Granzyme B and IFNγ upon antigen-independent, innate-like recall by IL-12 and IL-18. In addition, helped memory CTLs express the effector program characteristic of helped primary CTLs upon recall with MHC class I-restricted antigens, likely due to epigenetic imprinting and sustained mRNA expression of effector genes. Our data thus indicate that during priming, CD4+ T cell help optimizes CTL memory by creating TEM cells with innate and help-independent antigen-specific recall capacities.","['1 Division of Tumor Biology and Immunology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute-Antoni van Leeuwenhoek, 1066 CX, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', '2 Laboratory of Mucosal Immunology, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY, USA.', '3 Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', '4 Division of Molecular Carcinogenesis, Oncode Institute, The Netherlands Cancer Institute-Antoni van Leeuwenhoek, 1066 CX, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', '5 Division of Gene Regulation, The Netherlands Cancer Institute-Antoni van Leeuwenhoek, 1066 CX, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', '6 Division of Tumor Biology and Immunology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute-Antoni van Leeuwenhoek, 1066 CX, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. j.g.borst@lumc.nl.', '7 Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands. j.g.borst@lumc.nl.']","Tomasz Ahrends, Julia Busselaar, Tesa M Severson, Nikolina Bąbała, Evert de Vries, Astrid Bovens, Lodewyk Wessels, Fred van Leeuwen, Jannie Borst, ",Nature communications,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31797935
744,Evaluation of Chatbot Prototypes for Taking the Virtual Patient's History,"In medical education Virtual Patients (VP) are often applied to train students in different scenarios such as recording the patient's medical history or deciding a treatment option. Usually, such interactions are predefined by software logic and databases following strict rules. At this point, Natural Language Processing/Machine Learning (NLP/ML) algorithms could help to increase the overall flexibility, since most of the rules can derive directly from training data. This would allow a more sophisticated and individual conversation between student and VP. One type of technology that is heavily based on such algorithmic advances are chatbots or conversational agents. Therefore, a literature review is carried out to give insight into existing educational ideas with such agents. Besides, different prototypes are implemented for the scenario of taking the patient's medical history, responding with the classified intent of a generic anamnestic question. Although the small number of questions (n=109) leads to a high SD during evaluation, all scores (recall, precision, f1) reach already a level above 80% (micro-averaged). This shows a first promising step to use these prototypes for taking the medical history of a VP.","['1 GECKO Institute, Heilbronn University of Applied Sciences, Heilbronn, Germany.']","Andreas Reiswich, Martin Haag, ",Studies in health technology and informatics,2019,algorithms; machine learning; medical education; natural language processing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31118321

These non-medical skills are central to leadership and career development, and are clinically relevant and vital to a trainees success as a practicing physician. However, identification of actionable feedback from reflective writings can be chal- lenging. In this work, we utilize a Natural Language Processing pipeline that incorporates a seeded Term Frequency- Inverse Document Frequency matrix along with sentence-level summarization, sentiment analysis, and clustering to organize sentences into groups, which can aid educators in assessing common challenges experienced by Acting In- terns. Automated analysis of reflective writing is difficult due to its subjective nature; however, our method is able to identify known and new challenges such as issues accessing the electronic health system and adjusting to specialty differences. Medical educators can utilize these topics to identify areas needing attention in the medical curriculum and help students through this transitional time.","['1 Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA.', '2 Virginia Commonwealth University Health System, Richmond, VA, USA.']","Amy L Olex, Deborah DiazGranados, Bridget T McInnes, Stephanie Goldberg, ",AMIA Joint Summits on Translational Science proceedings.

746,Data extraction methods for systematic review (semi)automation: A living review protocol,"Background: Researchers in evidence-based medicine cannot keep up with the amounts of both old and newly published primary research articles. Support for the early stages of the systematic review process - searching and screening studies for eligibility - is necessary because it is currently impossible to search for relevant research with precision. Better automated data extraction may not only facilitate the stage of review traditionally labelled 'data extraction', but also change earlier phases of the review process by making it possible to identify relevant research. Exponential improvements in computational processing speed and data storage are fostering the development of data mining models and algorithms. This, in combination with quicker pathways to publication, led to a large landscape of tools and methods for data mining and extraction. Objective: To review published methods and tools for data extraction to (semi)automate the systematic reviewing process. Methods: We propose to conduct a living review. With this methodology we aim to do constant evidence surveillance, bi-monthly search updates, as well as review updates every 6 months if new evidence permits it. In a cross-sectional analysis we will extract methodological characteristics and assess the quality of reporting in our included papers. Conclusions: We aim to increase transparency in the reporting and assessment of automation technologies to the benefit of data scientists, systematic reviewers and funders of health research. This living review will help to reduce duplicate efforts by data scientists who develop data mining methods. It will also serve to inform systematic reviewers about possibilities to support their data extraction.","['1 Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Bristol, BS8 2PS, UK.', '2 UCL Social Research Institute, University College London, London, WC1H 0AL, UK.']","Lena Schmidt, Babatunde K Olorisade, Luke A McGuinness, James Thomas, Julian P T Higgins, ",F1000Research,2020,Data Extraction; Natural Language Processing; Reproducibility; Systematic reviews; Text mining.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32724560
747,Real-time communicative perspective taking in younger and older adults,"One core question in studies of language processing is the extent to which interlocutors engage in real-time communicative perspective-taking. Current evidence suggests that both children and young adult listeners are able to draw on common ground (shared knowledge) to guide referential interpretation. However, less is known about older listeners, who are often described as experiencing age-related cognitive declines that could affect their capacity to integrate perspective cues online. In the present study, we examined the extent to which younger and older listeners used common ground to guide the interpretation of temporarily ambiguous descriptions. Participants followed instructions from a Director to click on displayed objects. The target object (e.g., hat with blue feathers) was accompanied by a competitor (e.g., hat with pink feathers) or a control object (e.g., stapler). We manipulated whether the competitor/control was mutually visible (common ground) or not (privileged ground). The results revealed that, although listeners used perspective information to differentiate the target from the competitor in the common ground condition, this pattern was notably weaker in older adults. Whereas measures of executive function showed significant group differences in inhibitory control and working memory, no differences were found in theory of mind. Thus, age-related changes in communicative perspective-taking are not likely due to general declines in mentalizing ability. Furthermore, strict screening criteria for vision and hearing ability allowed us to rule out explanations involving age-related sensory decline. Together, the results advance our understanding of how younger and older adults integrate common ground during real-time referential processing.

750,Nonlinear transduction of emotional facial expression,"To create neural representations of external stimuli, the brain performs a number of processing steps that transform its inputs. For fundamental attributes, such as stimulus contrast, this involves one or more nonlinearities that are believed to optimise the neural code to represent features of the natural environment. Here we ask if the same is also true of more complex stimulus dimensions, such as emotional facial expression. We report the results of three experiments combining morphed facial stimuli with electrophysiological and psychophysical methods to measure the function mapping emotional expression intensity to internal response. The results converge on a nonlinearity that accelerates over weak expressions, and then becomes shallower for stronger expressions, similar to the situation for lower level stimulus properties. We further demonstrate that the nonlinearity is not attributable to the morphing procedure used in stimulus generation.","['1 School of Psychology and Clinical Language Sciences, University of Reading, Reading RG6 6BZ, UK.

751,LogEvent2vec: LogEvent-to-Vector Based Anomaly Detection for Large-Scale Logs in Internet of Things,"Log anomaly detection is an efficient method to manage modern large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) systems. More and more works start to apply natural language processing (NLP) methods, and in particular word2vec, in the log feature extraction. Word2vec can extract the relevance between words and vectorize the words. However, the computing cost of training word2vec is high. Anomalies in logs are dependent on not only an individual log message but also on the log message sequence. Therefore, the vector of words from word2vec can not be used directly, which needs to be transformed into the vector of log events and further transformed into the vector of log sequences. To reduce computational cost and avoid multiple transformations, in this paper, we propose an offline feature extraction model, named LogEvent2vec, which takes the log event as input of word2vec to extract the relevance between log events and vectorize log events directly. LogEvent2vec can work with any coordinate transformation methods and anomaly detection models. After getting the log event vector, we transform log event vector to log sequence vector by bary or tf-idf and three kinds of supervised models (Random Forests, Naive Bayes, and Neural Networks) are trained to detect the anomalies. We have conducted extensive experiments on a real public log dataset from BlueGene/L (BGL). The experimental results demonstrate that LogEvent2vec can significantly reduce computational time by 30 times and improve accuracy, comparing with word2vec. LogEvent2vec with bary and Random Forest can achieve the best F1-score and LogEvent2vec with tf-idf and Naive Bayes needs the least computational time.","['1 School of Computer and Communication Engineering, Hunan Provincial Key Laboratory of Intelligent Processing of Big Data on Transportation, Changsha University of Science and Technology, Changsha 410114, China.', '2 Key Lab of Broadband Wireless Communication and Sensor Network Technology (Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications), Ministry of Education, Nanjing 210003, China.', '3 Department of Computing Science, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen AB243FX, UK.', '4 Computer Science Department, Community College, King Saud University, Riyadh 11437, Saudi Arabia.', '5 Mathematics and Computer Science Department, Faculty of Science, Menoufia University, Menoufia 32511, Egypt.']","Jin Wang, Yangning Tang, Shiming He, Changqing Zhao, Pradip Kumar Sharma, Osama Alfarraj, Amr Tolba, ","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2020,IoT; device management; log anomaly detection; log event; log template; word2vec.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32357404
752,Symptom-based patient stratification in mental illness using clinical notes,"Mental illnesses are highly heterogeneous with diagnoses based on symptoms that are generally qualitative, subjective, and documented in free text clinical notes rather than as structured data. Moreover, there exists significant variation in symptoms within diagnostic categories as well as substantial overlap in symptoms between diagnostic categories. These factors pose extra challenges for phenotyping patients with mental illness, a task that has proven challenging even for seemingly well characterized diseases. The ability to identify more homogeneous patient groups could both increase our ability to apply a precision medicine approach to psychiatric disorders and enable elucidation of underlying biological mechanism of pathology. We describe a novel approach to deep phenotyping in mental illness in which contextual term extraction is used to identify constellations of symptoms in a cohort of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and related disorders. We applied topic modeling and dimensionality reduction to identify similar groups of patients and evaluate the resulting clusters through visualization and interrogation of clinically interpretable weighted features. Our findings show that patients diagnosed with schizophrenia may be meaningfully stratified using symptom-based clustering.","['1 Department of Statistics, Duke University School of Medicine, United States.', '2 Department of Medicine, Duke University School of Medicine, United States.', '3 Computational Biology and Bioinformatics Program, Duke University School of Medicine, United States.', '4 Department of Psychiatry, Duke University School of Medicine, United States.', '5 Department of Medicine, Duke University School of Medicine, United States; Department of Psychiatry, Duke University School of Medicine, United States.', '6 Department of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics, Duke University School of Medicine, United States.

      Errors in grammar, spelling, and usage in radiology reports are common. To automatically detect inappropriate insertions, deletions, and substitutions of words in radiology reports, we proposed using a neural sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model. Methods:
      
    

    
      Head CT and chest radiograph reports from Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH) (n=61,722 and 818,978, respectively), Mount Sinai Queens (MSQ) (n=30,145 and 194,309, respectively) and MIMIC-III (n=32,259 and 54,685) were converted into sentences. Insertions, substitutions, and deletions of words were randomly introduced. Seq2seq models were trained using corrupted sentences as input to predict original uncorrupted sentences. Three models were trained using head CTs from MSH, chest radiographs from MSH, and head CTs from all three collections. Model performance was assessed across different sites and modalities. A sample of original, uncorrupted sentences were manually reviewed for any error in syntax, usage, or spelling to estimate real-world proofreading performance of the algorithm. Results:
      
    

    
      Seq2seq detected 90.3% and 88.2% of corrupted sentences with 97.7% and 98.8% specificity in same-site, same-modality test sets for head CTs and chest radiographs, respectively. Manual review of original, uncorrupted same-site same-modality head CT sentences demonstrated seq2seq positive predictive value (PPV) 0.393 (157/400; 95% CI, 0.346-0.441) and negative predictive value (NPV) 0.986 (789/800; 95% CI, 0.976-0.992) for detecting sentences containing real-world errors, with estimated sensitivity of 0.389 (95% CI, 0.267-0.542) and specificity 0.986 (95% CI, 0.985-0.987) over n=86,211 uncorrupted training examples. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Seq2seq models can be highly effective at detecting erroneous insertions, deletions, and substitutions of words in radiology reports. To achieve high performance, these models require site- and modality-specific training examples. Incorporating additional targeted training data could further improve performance in detecting real-world errors in reports.","['1 Department of Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA.', '2 Project Jupyter, 190 Doe Library, Berkeley, CA, USA.', '3 Department of Neurosurgery, Icahn School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA.']","John Zech, Jessica Forde, Joseph J Titano, Deepak Kaji, Anthony Costa, Eric Karl Oermann, ",Annals of translational medicine,2019 Jun,Radiology; artificial intelligence; machine learning; natural language processing; neural networks (computer).,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31317003

      Of 4442 citations reviewed, 41 studies met the inclusion criteria. Seventeen models predicted risk of readmission for all patients and 24 developed predictions for patient specific populations, with 13 of those being developed for patients with heart conditions. Except for two studies from the UK and Israel, all were from the US. The total sample size for each model ranged between 349 and 1 195 640. Twenty five models used a split sample validation technique. Seventeen of 41 studies reported C statistics of 0.75 or greater. Fifteen models used calibration techniques to further refine the model. Using EMR data enabled final predictive models to use a wide variety of clinical measures such as laboratory results and vital signs; however, use of socioeconomic features or functional status was rare. Using natural language processing, three models were able to extract relevant psychosocial features, which substantially improved their predictions. Twenty six studies used logistic or Cox regression models, and the rest used machine learning methods. No statistically significant difference (difference 0.03, 95% confidence interval -0.0 to 0.07) was found between average C statistics of models developed using regression methods (0.71, 0.68 to 0.73) and machine learning (0.74, 0.71 to 0.77).

      On average, prediction models using EMR data have better predictive performance than those using administrative data. However, this improvement remains modest. Most of the studies examined lacked inclusion of socioeconomic features, failed to calibrate the models, neglected to conduct rigorous diagnostic testing, and did not discuss clinical impact.","['1 Department of Family Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA Mahmoudi@med.umich.edu.', '2 Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', '3 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', '4 Department of Surgery, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', '5 Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', '6 Department of Family Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', '7 Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', '8 Department of Learning Health Sciences, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', '9 Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', '10 Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', '11 Michigan Integrated Center for Health Analytics and Medical Prediction (MiCHAMP), University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', '12 Veterans Affairs Center for Clinical Management Research, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.']","Elham Mahmoudi, Neil Kamdar, Noa Kim, Gabriella Gonzales, Karandeep Singh, Akbar K Waljee, ",BMJ (Clinical research ed.),2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32269037
756,An artificial intelligence approach to COVID-19 infection risk assessment in virtual visits: A case report,"Objective:
      
    

    
      In an effort to improve the efficiency of computer algorithms applied to screening for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) testing, we used natural language processing and artificial intelligence-based methods with unstructured patient data collected through telehealth visits. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      After segmenting and parsing documents, we conducted analysis of overrepresented words in patient symptoms. We then developed a word embedding-based convolutional neural network for predicting COVID-19 test results based on patients' self-reported symptoms. Results:
      
    

    
      Text analytics revealed that concepts such as smell and taste were more prevalent than expected in patients testing positive. As a result, screening algorithms were adapted to include these symptoms. The deep learning model yielded an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.729 for predicting positive results and was subsequently applied to prioritize testing appointment scheduling.

758,"Deep-Learning Language-Modeling Approach for Automated, Personalized, and Iterative Radiology-Pathology Correlation","Purpose:
      
    

    
      Radiology-pathology correlation has long been foundational to continuing education, peer learning, quality assurance, and multidisciplinary patient care. The objective of this study was to determine whether modern deep-learning language-modeling techniques could reliably match pathology reports to pertinent radiology reports. Methods:
      
    

    
      The recently proposed Universal Language Model Fine-Tuning for Text Classification methodology was used. Two hundred thousand radiology and pathology reports were used for adaptation to the radiology-pathology space. One hundred thousand candidate radiology-pathology pairs, evenly split into match and no-match categories, were used for training the final binary classification model. Matches were defined by a previous-generation artificial intelligence anatomic concept radiology-pathology correlation system. Results:
      
    

    
      The language model rapidly adapted very closely to the prior anatomic concept-matching approach, with 100% specificity, 65.1% sensitivity, and 73.7% accuracy. For comparison, the previous methodology, which was intentionally designed to be specific at the expense of sensitivity, had 98.0% specificity, 65.1% sensitivity, and 73.2% accuracy. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Modern deep-learning language-modeling approaches are promising for radiology-pathology correlation. Because of their rapid adaptation to underlying training labels, these models advance previous artificial intelligence work in that they can be continuously improved and tuned to improve performance and adjust to user and site-level preference.","['1 MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, Washington, District of Columbia.

Understanding contexts within different online medical activities becomes a significant issue to facilitate patients' medical decision making process. As a subcategory of machine learning, neural networks have drawn increasing attentions in natural language processing applications. In this study, we focus on the modeling and analysis of patient-physician-generated data based on an integrated CNN-RNN framework. A CNN-based classifier is designed to extract textural features in the sentence-level, and a RNN-based model is constructed to learn the potential patterns and correlations in a dialog-level. An intelligent recommendation mechanism is then developed to provide patients with automatic clinic guide and pre-diagnosis suggestions in a data-driven way.

760,Rich Visual Knowledge-Based Augmentation Network for Visual Question Answering,"Visual question answering (VQA) that involves understanding an image and paired questions develops very quickly with the boost of deep learning in relevant research fields, such as natural language processing and computer vision. Existing works highly rely on the knowledge of the data set. However, some questions require more professional cues other than the data set knowledge to answer questions correctly. To address such an issue, we propose a novel framework named a knowledge-based augmentation network (KAN) for VQA. We introduce object-related open-domain knowledge to assist the question answering. Concretely, we extract more visual information from images and introduce a knowledge graph to provide the necessary common sense or experience for the reasoning process. For these two augmented inputs, we design an attention module that can adjust itself according to the specific questions, such that the importance of external knowledge against detected objects can be balanced adaptively. Extensive experiments show that our KAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on three challenging VQA data sets, i.e., VQA v2, VQA-CP v2, and FVQA. In addition, our open-domain knowledge is also beneficial to VQA baselines.

761,Weak Disambiguation for Partial Structured Output Learning,"Existing disambiguation strategies for partial structured output learning just cannot generalize well to solve the problem that there are some candidates that can be false positive or similar to the ground-truth label. In this article, we propose a novel weak disambiguation for partial structured output learning (WD-PSL). First, a piecewise large margin formulation is generalized to partial structured output learning, which effectively avoids handling a large number of candidate-structured outputs for complex structures. Second, in the proposed weak disambiguation strategy, each candidate label is assigned with a confidence value indicating how likely it is the true label, which aims to reduce the negative effects of wrong ground-truth label assignment in the learning process. Then, two large margins are formulated to combine two types of constraints which are the disambiguation between candidates and noncandidates, and the weak disambiguation for candidates. In the framework of alternating optimization, a new 2n-slack variables cutting plane algorithm is developed to accelerate each iteration of optimization. The experimental results on several sequence labeling tasks of natural language processing show the effectiveness of the proposed model.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Xiaolei Lu, Tommy W S Chow, ",IEEE transactions on cybernetics,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32574146
762,Extractive single document summarization using binary differential evolution: Optimization of different sentence quality measures,"With the increase in the amount of text information in different real-life applications, automatic text-summarization systems become more predominant in extracting relevant information. In the current study, we formulated the problem of extractive text-summarization as a binary optimization problem, and multi-objective binary differential evolution (DE) based optimization strategy is employed to solve this. The solutions of DE encode a possible subset of sentences to be present in the summary which is then evaluated based on some statistical features (objective functions) namely, the position of the sentence in the document, the similarity of a sentence with the title, length of the sentence, cohesion, readability, and coverage. These objective functions, measuring different aspects of summary, are optimized simultaneously using the search capability of DE. Some newly designed self-organizing map (SOM) based genetic operators are incorporated in the optimization process to improve the convergence. SOM generates a mating pool containing solutions and their neighborhoods. This mating pool takes part in the genetic operation (crossover and mutation) to create new solutions. To measure the similarity or dissimilarity between sentences, different existing measures like normalized Google distance, word mover distance, and cosine similarity are explored. For the purpose of evaluation, two standard summarization datasets namely, DUC2001, and DUC2002 are utilized, and the obtained results are compared with various supervised, unsupervised and optimization strategy based existing summarization techniques using ROUGE measures. Results illustrate the superiority of our approach in terms of convergence rate and ROUGE scores as compared to state-of-the-art methods. We have obtained 45% and 5% improvements over two recent state-of-the-art methods considering ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-1 scores, respectively, for the DUC2001 dataset. While for the DUC2002 dataset, improvements obtained by our approach are 20% and 5%, considering ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-1 scores, respectively. In addition to these standard datasets, CNN news dataset is also utilized to evaluate the efficacy of our proposed approach. It was also shown that the best performance not only depends on the objective functions used but also on the correct choice of similarity/dissimilarity measure between sentences.","['1 Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Patna, Bihar, India.', '2 Department of Computer Science and Application, University of North Bengal, Darjeeling, West Bengal, India.']","Naveen Saini, Sriparna Saha, Dhiraj Chakraborty, Pushpak Bhattacharyya, ",PloS one,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31725721

For example, extracting diseases from clinical trial text can be helpful for patient profiling and other downstream applications such as matching clinical trials to eligible patients. Similarly, disease annotation in biomedical articles can help information search engines to accurately index them such that clinicians can easily find relevant articles to enhance their knowledge. In this paper, we propose a domain knowledge-enhanced long short-term memory network-conditional random field (LSTM-CRF) model for disease named entity recognition, which also augments a character-level convolutional neural network (CNN) and a character-level LSTM network for input embedding.

764,Clinical significance of PD-L1-positive cancer-associated fibroblasts in pN0M0 non-small cell lung cancer,"Objectives:
      
    

    
      Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a dominant cell type in tumor stroma and support the generation of pro-tumorigenic microenvironment. CAFs have frequent opportunities to interact with immune cells infiltrating the tumor stroma, but the process remains to be determined. In this study, we focused on immune checkpoint mechanism. We also examined the induction of programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) on CAFs by immune cell, and the clinical significance of PD-L1-expressed CAFs in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      CAFs were isolated from human NSCLC tissues, and PD-L1 expression levels in CAFs were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and flow-cytometry. Following immunohistochemical analysis of PD-L1 in surgically resected pN0M0 NSCLC (n = 125, including 88 invasive adenocarcinomas and 37 squamous cell carcinomas), the correlation of PD-L1-positive CAFs with clinicopathological features was investigated. Results:
      
    

    
      PD-L1 mRNA and protein expression on CAFs was upregulated by exogenously supplemented interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and downregulated through the depletion of IFN-γ. PD-L1 expression on CAFs was upregulated by co-culture with activated lymphocytes releasing IFN-γ. Immunohistochemistry revealed that PD-L1-positive CAFs were observed in 31 cases (24.8%). Postoperative relapse-free survival was significantly prolonged in patients with PD-L1-positive CAFs as compared with those with PD-L1-negative CAFs, with 5-year relapse-free probabilities of 84.5% and 66.3%, respectively (P = 0.031). Multivariate analysis revealed that PD-L1 expression on CAFs was an independent prognostic factor of longer relapse-free survival after surgery (hazard ratio: 3.225, P = 0.027). Conclusion:
      
    

    
      PD-L1 expression on CAFs is reversibly regulated by environmental stimuli including IFN-γ from activated lymphocytes. In the non-metastatic NSCLC, PD-L1 expression on CAFs suggests the induction of anti-tumor immune responses, contributing to better prognosis after surgery.","['1 Department of Medical Oncology and Cancer Center, Shiga University of Medical Science, Seta-Tsukinowa, Otsu, Shiga 520-2192, Japan; Center for Advanced Medicine against Cancer, Shiga University of Medical Science, Seta-Tsukinowa, Otsu, Shiga 520-2192, Japan; Center for Antibody and Vaccine Therapy, Research Hospital, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1, Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.

765,Exploring Substance Use Tweets of Youth in the United States: Mixed Methods Study,"Background:
      
    

    
      Substance use by youth remains a significant public health concern. Social media provides the opportunity to discuss and display substance use-related beliefs and behaviors, suggesting that the act of posting drug-related content, or viewing posted content, may influence substance use in youth. This aligns with empirically supported theories, which posit that behavior is influenced by perceptions of normative behavior. Nevertheless, few studies have explored the content of posts by youth related to substance use. Objective:
      
    

    
      This study aimed to identify the beliefs and behaviors of youth related to substance use by characterizing the content of youths' drug-related tweets. Using a sequential explanatory mixed methods approach, we sampled drug-relevant tweets and qualitatively examined their content. Methods:
      
    

    
      We used natural language processing to determine the frequency of drug-related words in public tweets (from 2011 to 2015) among youth Twitter users geolocated to Pennsylvania. We limited our sample by age (13-24 years), yielding approximately 23 million tweets from 20,112 users. We developed a list of drug-related keywords and phrases and selected a random sample of tweets with the most commonly used keywords to identify themes (n=249). Results:
      
    

    
      We identified two broad classes of emergent themes: functional themes and relational themes. Functional themes included posts that explicated a function of drugs in one's life, with subthemes indicative of pride, longing, coping, and reminiscing as they relate to drug use and effects. Relational themes emphasized a relational nature of substance use, capturing substance use as a part of social relationships, with subthemes indicative of drug-related identity and companionship. We also identified topical areas in tweets related to drug use, including reference to polysubstance use, pop culture, and antidrug content. Across the tweets, the themes of pride (63/249, 25.3%) and longing (39/249, 15.7%) were the most popular. Most tweets that expressed pride (46/63, 73%) were explicitly related to marijuana. Nearly half of the tweets on coping (17/36, 47%) were related to prescription drugs. Very few of the tweets contained antidrug content (9/249, 3.6%). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Data integration indicates that drugs are typically discussed in a positive manner, with content largely reflective of functional and relational patterns of use. The dissemination of this information, coupled with the relative absence of antidrug content, may influence youth such that they perceive drug use as normative and justified. Strategies to address the underlying causes of drug use (eg, coping with stressors) and engage antidrug messaging on social media may reduce normative perceptions and associated behaviors among youth. The findings of this study warrant research to further examine the effects of this content on beliefs and behaviors and to identify ways to leverage social media to decrease substance use in this population.","['1 Department of Family and Community Health, University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing, Philadelphia, PA, United States.', '2 University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing, Philadelphia, PA, United States.', '3 Wharton Risk Management and Decision Processes Center, Philadelphia, PA, United States.', '4 Department of Computer and Information Science, Philadelphia, PA, United States.', '5 Crescenz Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Philadelphia, PA, United States.']","Robin C Stevens, Bridgette M Brawner, Elissa Kranzler, Salvatore Giorgi, Elizabeth Lazarus, Maramawit Abera, Sarah Huang, Lyle Ungar, ",JMIR public health and surveillance,2020,adolescent; illicit drug; social media; youth.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32213472

      Family history information (FHI) described in unstructured electronic health records (EHRs) is a valuable information source for patient care and scientific researches. Since FHI is usually described in the format of free text, the entire process of FHI extraction consists of various steps including section segmentation, family member and clinical observation extraction, and relation discovery between the extracted members and their observations. The extraction step involves the recognition of FHI concepts along with their properties such as the family side attribute of the family member concept. Methods:
      
    

    
      This study focuses on the extraction step and formulates it as a sequence labeling problem. We employed a neural sequence labeling model along with different tag schemes to distinguish family members and their observations. Corresponding to different tag schemes, the identified entities were aggregated and processed by different algorithms to determine the required properties. Results:
      
    

    
      We studied the effectiveness of encoding required properties in the tag schemes by evaluating their performance on the dataset released by the BioCreative/OHNLP challenge 2018. It was observed that the proposed side scheme along with the developed features and neural network architecture can achieve an overall F1-score of 0.849 on the test set, which ranked second in the FHI entity recognition subtask. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      By comparing with the performance of conditional random fields models, the developed neural network-based models performed significantly better. However, our error analysis revealed two challenging issues of the current approach. One is that some properties required cross-sentence inferences. The other is that the current model is not able to distinguish between the narratives describing the family members of the patient and those specifying the relatives of the patient's family members.","['1 Department of Electrical Engineering, National Kaohsiung University of Science and Technology, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, Republic of China. hjdai@nkust.edu.tw.', '2 School of Post-Baccalaureate Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, Republic of China. hjdai@nkust.edu.tw.', '3 Interdisciplinary Program of Green and Information Technology, National Taitung University, Taitung, Taiwan, Republic of China. hjdai@nkust.edu.tw.']","Hong-Jie Dai, ",BMC medical informatics and decision making,2019,Family history information extraction; Named entity recognition; Neural sequence labeling modeling.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31881965

The time to assign a priority at triage is short and it is vital to accurately stratify patients at this stage, since under-triage can lead to increased morbidity, mortality and costs. Our aim was to present a model that can assist healthcare professionals in triage decision making, namely in the stratification of patients through the risk prediction of a composite critical outcome-mortality and cardiopulmonary arrest. Our study cohort consisted of 235826 adult patients triaged at a Portuguese Emergency Department from 2012 to 2016. Patients were assigned to emergent, very urgent or urgent priorities of the Manchester Triage System (MTS). Demographics, clinical variables routinely collected at triage and the patients' chief complaint were used. Logistic regression, random forests and extreme gradient boosting were developed using all available variables. The term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) natural language processing weighting factor was applied to vectorize the chief complaint. Stratified random sampling was used to split the data into train (70%) and test (30%) data sets. Ten-fold cross validation was performed in train to optimize model hyper-parameters. The performance obtained with the best model was compared against the reference model-a regularized logistic regression trained using only triage priorities. Extreme gradient boosting exhibited good calibration properties and yielded areas under the receiver operating characteristic and precision-recall curves of 0.96 (95% CI 0.95-0.97) and 0.31 (95% CI 0.26-0.36), respectively. The predictors ranked with higher importance by this model were the Glasgow coma score, the patients' age, pulse oximetry and arrival mode. Compared to the reference, the extreme gradient boosting model using clinical variables and the chief complaint presented higher recall for patients assigned MTS-3 and can identify those who are at risk of the composite outcome.","['1 IDMEC, Instituto Superior Técnico, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal.', '2 Hospital da Luz Learning Health, Lisbon, Portugal.', '3 Hospital Beatriz Ângelo, Luz Saúde, Lisbon, Portugal.', '4 MIT Critical Data, Laboratory for Computational Physiology, Harvard-MIT Health Sciences & Technology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.', '5 Institute for Data, Systems and Society, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.', '6 Department of Emergency Medicine / Division of Clinical Informatics / Center for Healthcare Delivery Science, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.', '7 Division of Pulmonary Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.']","Marta Fernandes, Rúben Mendes, Susana M Vieira, Francisca Leite, Carlos Palos, Alistair Johnson, Stan Finkelstein, Steven Horng, Leo Anthony Celi, ",PloS one,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32240233
768,Broad-coverage biomedical relation extraction with SemRep,"Background:
      
    

    
      In the era of information overload, natural language processing (NLP) techniques are increasingly needed to support advanced biomedical information management and discovery applications. In this paper, we present an in-depth description of SemRep, an NLP system that extracts semantic relations from PubMed abstracts using linguistic principles and UMLS domain knowledge. We also evaluate SemRep on two datasets. In one evaluation, we use a manually annotated test collection and perform a comprehensive error analysis. In another evaluation, we assess SemRep's performance on the CDR dataset, a standard benchmark corpus annotated with causal chemical-disease relationships. Results:
      
    

    
      A strict evaluation of SemRep on our manually annotated dataset yields 0.55 precision, 0.34 recall, and 0.42 F 1 score. A relaxed evaluation, which more accurately characterizes SemRep performance, yields 0.69 precision, 0.42 recall, and 0.52 F 1 score. An error analysis reveals named entity recognition/normalization as the largest source of errors (26.9%), followed by argument identification (14%) and trigger detection errors (12.5%). The evaluation on the CDR corpus yields 0.90 precision, 0.24 recall, and 0.38 F 1 score. The recall and the F 1 score increase to 0.35 and 0.50, respectively, when the evaluation on this corpus is limited to sentence-bound relationships, which represents a fairer evaluation, as SemRep operates at the sentence level. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      SemRep is a broad-coverage, interpretable, strong baseline system for extracting semantic relations from biomedical text. It also underpins SemMedDB, a literature-scale knowledge graph based on semantic relations. Through SemMedDB, SemRep has had significant impact in the scientific community, supporting a variety of clinical and translational applications, including clinical decision making, medical diagnosis, drug repurposing, literature-based discovery and hypothesis generation, and contributing to improved health outcomes. In ongoing development, we are redesigning SemRep to increase its modularity and flexibility, and addressing weaknesses identified in the error analysis.","['1 Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications, National Library of Medicine, 8600 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, 20894, MD, USA. halil@illinois.edu.', '2 University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, School of Information Sciences, 501 E Daniel Street, Champaign, 61820, IL, USA. halil@illinois.edu.', '3 Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications, National Library of Medicine, 8600 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, 20894, MD, USA.', '4 Independent Researcher, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.']","Halil Kilicoglu, Graciela Rosemblat, Marcelo Fiszman, Dongwook Shin, ",BMC bioinformatics,2020,Biomedical relation extraction; Natural language processing; Scientific publications; Semantic interpretation.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32410573

Our classification model obtained 100% accuracy on the basis of 10-fold cross-validation. Precision, recall, and F1 for class-specific named-entity recognition models show strong performance. Conclusion:

770,Assessing data availability and quality within an electronic health record system through external validation against an external clinical data source,"Background:
      
    

    
      Approximately 20% of deaths in the US each year are attributable to smoking, yet current practices in the recording of this health risk in electronic health records (EHRs) have not led to discernable changes in health outcomes. Several groups have developed algorithms for extracting smoking behaviors from clinical notes, but none of these approaches were assessed with external data to report on anticipated clinical performance. Methods:
      
    

    
      Previously, we developed an informatics pipeline that extracts smoking status, pack year history, and cessation date from clinical notes. Here we report on the clinical implementation performance of our pipeline using 1,504 clinical notes matched to an external questionnaire. Results:
      
    

    
      We found that 73% of available notes contained no smoking behavior information. The weighted Cohen's kappa between the external questionnaire and EHR smoking status was 0.62 (95% CI 0.56-0.69) for the clinical notes we were able to extract information from. The correlation between pack years reported by our pipeline and the external questionnaire was 0.39 on the 81 notes for which this information was present in both. We also assessed for lung cancer screening eligibility using notes from individuals identified as never smokers or smokers with pack year history extracted by our pipeline (n = 196). We found a positive predictive value of 85.4%, a negative predictive value of 83.8%, sensitivity of 63.1%, and specificity of 94.7%. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We have demonstrated that our pipeline can extract smoking behaviors from unannotated EHR notes when the information is present. This information is reliable enough to identify patients most likely to be eligible for smoking related services. Ensuring capture of smoking information during clinical encounters should continue to be a high priority.","['1 Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH, USA. elp76@case.edu.', '2 Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH, USA.', '3 New Hampshire Colonoscopy Registery, Lebanon, NH, USA.', '4 Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.']","Ellen L Palmer, John Higgins, Saeed Hassanpour, James Sargent, Christina M Robinson, Jennifer A Doherty, Tracy Onega, ",BMC medical informatics and decision making,2019,Electronic health records; Informatics pipeline; Natural language processing; Smokers registry.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31345210

The potential value of linguistic biomarkers has been significantly magnified, however, by recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML). Such methodologies allow for the rapid and objective measurement of language features, many of which are not easily recognized by human raters. Here we review the key findings on language production disturbance in psychosis. We also describe recent advances in the computational methods used to analyze language data, including methods for the automatic measurement of discourse coherence, syntactic complexity, poverty of content, referential coherence, and metaphorical language. Linguistic biomarkers of psychosis risk are now undergoing cross-validation, with attention to harmonization of methods. Future directions in extended CHR networks include studies of sources of variance, and combination with other promising biomarkers of psychosis risk, such as cognitive and sensory processing impairments likely to be related to language. Implications for the broader study of social communication, including reciprocal prosody, face expression and gesture, are discussed.","['1 Department of Psychiatry, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', '2 Department of Psychology, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA.', '3 Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences, University of California Los Angeles, CA, USA; Department of Psychology, Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior, Brain Research Institute, University of California Los Angeles, CA, USA; Department of Psychology, University of California Los Angeles, CA USA.', '4 Brain Behavior Laboratory, Neuropsychiatry Division, Department of Psychiatry, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.', '5 Department of Linguistics, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA.', '6 Department of Diagnostics and Intensive Care, University Psychiatric Hospital Vrapce, Zagreb, Croatia.', '7 Computational Biology Center-Neuroscience, IBM T.J.

Parallel sentences with register variation (like expert and non-expert documents) can be exploited for the automatic text simplification. The aim of automatic text simplification is to better access and understand a given information. In the biomedical field, simplification may permit patients to understand medical and health texts. Yet, there is currently no such available resources. We propose to exploit comparable corpora which are distinguished by their registers (specialized and simplified versions) to detect and align parallel sentences. These corpora are in French and are related to the biomedical area. We treat this task as binary classification (alignment/non-alignment). Our results show that the method we present here can be used to automatically generate a corpus of parallel sentences from our comparable corpus.","['1 UMR CNRS 8163 - STL, F-59000 Lille, France.']","Rémi Cardon, Natalia Grabar, ",Studies in health technology and informatics,2020,classification; sentence alignment; text simplification.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32570407
775,Broadening the Message: A Nanovaccine Co-loaded with Messenger RNA and α-GalCer Induces Antitumor Immunity through Conventional and Natural Killer T Cells,"Messenger RNA encoding tumor antigens has the potential to evoke effective antitumor immunity. This study reports on a nanoparticle platform, named mRNA Galsomes, that successfully co-delivers nucleoside-modified antigen-encoding mRNA and the glycolipid antigen and immunopotentiator α-galactosylceramide (α-GC) to antigen-presenting cells after intravenous administration. By co-formulating low doses of α-GC, mRNA Galsomes induce a pluripotent innate and adaptive tumor-specific immune response in mice, with invariant natural killer T cells (iNKT) as a driving force. In comparison, mRNA Galsomes exhibit advantages over the state-of-the-art cancer vaccines using unmodified ovalbumin (OVA)-encoding mRNA, as we observed up to seven times more tumor-infiltrating antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells, combined with a strong iNKT cell and NK cell activation. In addition, the presence of suppressive myeloid cells (myeloid-derived suppressor cells and tumor-associated macrophages) in the tumor microenvironment was significantly lowered. Owing to these antitumor effects, OVA mRNA Galsomes significantly reduced tumor growth in established E.G7-OVA lymphoma, with a complete tumor rejection in 40% of the animals. Moreover, therapeutic vaccination with mRNA Galsomes enhanced the responsiveness to treatment with a PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor in B16-OVA melanoma, as evidenced by a synergistic reduction of tumor outgrowth and a significantly prolonged median survival. Taken together, these data show that intravenously administered mRNA Galsomes can provide controllable, multifaceted, and effective antitumor immunity, especially when combined with checkpoint inhibition.","['1 Ghent Research Group on Nanomedicines, Faculty of Pharmacy , Ghent University , Ghent 9000 , Belgium.', '2 Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent University Hospital , Ghent University , Ghent 9000 , Belgium.', '3 Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Therapy, Department of Biomedical Sciences , Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) , Jette 1090 , Belgium.', '4 Laboratory for Medicinal Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy , Ghent University , Ghent 9000 , Belgium.']","Rein Verbeke, Ine Lentacker, Karine Breckpot, Jonas Janssens, Serge Van Calenbergh, Stefaan C De Smedt, Heleen Dewitte, ",ACS nano,2019,T cell; checkpoint inhibition; iNKT cells; mRNA vaccine; modified nucleotides; nanoparticle; α-galactosylceramide.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30742405
776,"Using Artificial Intelligence to Manage Thrombosis Research, Diagnosis, and Clinical Management","Thrombosis development in either arterial or venous system remains a major cause of death and disability worldwide. This poorly controlled in vivo clotting could result in many severe complications including myocardial infarction, venous thromboembolism, stroke, and cerebral venous thrombosis, to name a few. These conditions are collectively known as thromboembolic disorders (TEDs). Appropriate understanding of TEDs is challenging, as they are multifactorial and involve several and often different risk factors. Hence, it requires a collective effort and data from numerous research studies to fully comprehend molecular mechanisms for prediction, prevention, treatment, and overall management of these conditions. To accomplish this arduous feat, a comprehensive approach is required that can compile thousands of available experimental data and transform these into more applicable and purposeful findings. Thus, large datasets could be utilized to generate models that could be predictive of how an individual would respond when subjected to any kind of additional risk factors or surgery, hospitalization, etc., or in the presence of some susceptible genetic variations. Artificial intelligence-based methods harness the capabilities of computer software to imitate human behaviors such as language translation, visual perception, and, most importantly, decision making. These emerging tools, if appropriately explored, might assist in processing of large data and tackle the complexities of identifying novel or interesting pathways that could otherwise be hidden due to their enormity. This narrative review attempts to compile the applications of various subfields of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the context of thrombosis research to date. It further reflects on the potential of artificial intelligence in transforming enormous research data into translational application in the form of predictive computational models.","['1 Department of Biotechnology, Faculty of Natural Sciences, Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, India.']","Aastha Mishra, Mohammad Zahid Ashraf, ",Seminars in thrombosis and hemostasis,2020 Jun,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31563130

Most approaches to training the model rely on iterative algorithms, which makes it difficult to run LDA on big corpora that are best analyzed in parallel and distributed computational environments. Indeed, current approaches to parallel inference either don't converge to the correct posterior or require storage of large dense matrices in memory. We present a novel sampler that overcomes both problems, and we show that this sampler is faster, both empirically and theoretically, than previous Gibbs samplers for LDA. We do so by employing a novel Pólya-urn-based approximation in the sparse partially collapsed sampler for LDA. We prove that the approximation error vanishes with data size, making our algorithm asymptotically exact, a property of importance for large-scale topic models. In addition, we show, via an explicit example, that-contrary to popular belief in the topic modeling literature-partially collapsed samplers can be more efficient than fully collapsed samplers.

780,Social scene perception in autism spectrum disorder: An eye-tracking and pupillometric study,"Typically, developing humans innately place subjective value on social information and orient attention to it. This can be shown through tracking of gaze patterns and pupil size, the latter of which taps into an individual's cognitive engagement and affective arousal. People with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) present with atypical social, communicative and behavioral patterns, but underlying substrates of these behavioral differences remain unclear. Moreover, due to high comorbidity with other neurodevelopmental disorders, it is often difficult to distinguish which differences are distinctive to ASD. In this study, a group of 35 adolescents and young adults with neurodevelopmental disorders were tested to investigate the processing of social and non-social scenes in individuals who meet the diagnostic criteria for autism and those who do not. Eye tracking and pupillometry measures were collected while participants observed images of tightly controlled natural scenes with or without a human being. Contrary to individuals without autism diagnosis, participants with autism did not show greater pupillary response to images with a human. Participants with autism were slower to fixate on social elements in the social scenes, and this latency metric correlated with clinical measures of poor social functioning. The results confirm the clinical relevance of eye-tracking and pupillometric indices in the field of ASD. We discuss the clinical implications of the results and propose that analysis of changes in visual attention and physiological level to social stimuli might be an integral part of a neurodevelopmental assessment.","['1 Gillberg Neuropsychiatry Centre, Sahlgrenska academy, University of Gothenburg , Gothenburg , Sweden.', '2 Center for Social and Affective Neuroscience, Linköping University , Linköping , Sweden.', '3 Harvard Medical School/MGH/MIT, Athinoula A.

Its advantages over DNA transfection make it attractive in applications where transient expression is desired. However, this has proved challenging due to mRNA's instability and susceptibility to degradation. Selenium is important for immune function and modulation, with selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) finding a niche in biomedicine as drug delivery vehicles, owing to their biocompatibility, low toxicity, and biodegradability. In this investigation, we synthesized chitosan-coated SeNPs with a folic acid targeting moiety for Fluc mRNA delivery to cancer cells in vitro. Synthesized SeNPs were stable and well dispersed, and ranged from 59 to 102 nm in size. Nanoparticles bound and protected mRNA from RNase degradation, while exhibiting low cytotoxicity in the human embryonic kidney (HEK293), breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), and nasopharyngeal (KB) cells in culture. Moderate cytotoxicity evidenced in the colorectal carcinoma (Caco-2) and colon carcinoma (HT-29) cells was attributed to apoptosis induction by selenium, as confirmed by acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining. Selenium uptake studies corroborated the transfection results, where significant transgene expression was evident for the overexpressed folate receptor-positive KB cells when compared to the other cells with less or no folate receptors.","['1 Nano-Gene and Drug Delivery Group, Discipline of Biochemistry, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Private Bag X54001, Durban 4000, South Africa. fimaiyo@gmail.com.', '2 Nano-Gene and Drug Delivery Group, Discipline of Biochemistry, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Private Bag X54001, Durban 4000, South Africa. singhm1@ukzn.ac.za.']","Fiona Maiyo, Moganavelli Singh, ","Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)",2019,Fluc mRNA; cancer; cytotoxicity; immunotherapy; selenium nanoparticles; transfection.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31690043

      Local reactions are the most common vaccine-related adverse event. There is no specific diagnosis code for local reaction due to vaccination. Previous vaccine safety studies used non-specific diagnosis codes to identify potential local reaction cases and confirmed the cases through manual chart review. In this study, a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm was developed to identify local reaction associated with tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine in the Vaccine Safety Datalink. Methods:
      
    

    
      Presumptive cases of local reactions were identified among members ≥ 11 years of age using ICD-9-CM codes in all care settings in the 1-6 days following a Tdap vaccination between 2012 and 2014. The clinical notes were searched for signs and symptoms consistent with local reaction. Information on the timing and the location of a sign or symptom was also extracted to help determine whether or not the sign or symptom was vaccine related. Reactions triggered by causes other than Tdap vaccination were excluded. The NLP algorithm was developed at the lead study site and validated on a stratified random sample of 500 patients from five institutions. Results:
      
    

    
      The NLP algorithm achieved an overall weighted sensitivity of 87.9%, specificity of 92.8%, positive predictive value of 82.7%, and negative predictive value of 95.1%. In addition, using data at one site, the NLP algorithm identified 3326 potential Tdap-related local reactions that were not identified through diagnosis codes. Conclusion:

The tasks cover a variety of BioNLP problems such as semantic similarity, question answering, citation sentiment analysis and others with binary and multi-class datasets. Our goal is to assess the transferability of different sentence representation schemes to the medical and clinical domain. Our analysis shows that embeddings based on Language Models which account for the context-dependent nature of words, usually outperform others in terms of performance.

Our system used natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify different lexical and semantic similarity scores at sentence level as well as chunk level. We then used supervised learning to classify the reports into three categories- No Change (NC), Minor Changes (MiC), and major changes (MaC), reflecting how much the attending physician's report differs from that of the resident.

      This study aimed to compare patterns of MST disclosure in VHA by race/ethnicity. Research design:
      
    

    
      Retrospective cohort study of MST disclosures in a national, random sample of Veterans who served in Afghanistan and Iraq and completed MST screens from October 2009 to 2014. We used natural language processing (NLP) to extract MST concepts from electronic medical notes in the year following Veterans' first MST screen. Measure(s):
      
    

    
      Any evidence of MST (positive MST screen or NLP concepts) and late MST disclosure (NLP concepts following a negative MST screen). Multivariable logistic regressions, stratified by sex, tested racial/ethnic differences in any MST evidence, and late disclosure. Results:
      
    

    
      Of 6618 male and 6716 female Veterans with MST screen results, 1473 had a positive screen (68 male, 1%; 1405 female, 21%). Of those with a negative screen, 257 evidenced late MST disclosure by NLP (44 male, 39%; 213 female, 13%). Late MST disclosure was usually documented during mental health visits. There were no significant racial/ethnic differences in MST disclosure among men. Among women, blacks were less likely than whites to have any MST evidence (adjusted odds ratio=0.75).

786,A Hybrid Reporting Platform for Extended RadLex Coding Combining Structured Reporting Templates and Natural Language Processing,"Structured reporting is a favorable and sustainable form of reporting in radiology. Among its advantages are better presentation, clearer nomenclature, and higher quality. By using MRRT-compliant templates, the content of the categorized items (e.g., select fields) can be automatically stored in a database, which allows further research and quality analytics based on established ontologies like RadLex® linked to the items. Additionally, it is relevant to provide free-text input for descriptions of findings and impressions in complex imaging studies or for the information included with the clinical referral. So far, however, this unstructured content cannot be categorized. We developed a solution to analyze and code these free-text parts of the templates in our MRRT-compliant reporting platform, using natural language processing (NLP) with RadLex® terms in addition to the already categorized items. The established hybrid reporting concept is working successfully. The NLP tool provides RadLex® codes with modifiers (affirmed, speculated, negated). Radiologists can confirm or reject codes provided by NLP before finalizing the structured report. Furthermore, users can suggest RadLex® codes from free text that is not correctly coded with NLP or can suggest to change the modifier. Analyzing free-text fields took 1.23 s on average. Hybrid reporting enables coding of free-text information in our MRRT-compliant templates and thus increases the amount of categorized data that can be stored in the database.

      The study sought to determine the dependence of the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) rheumatoid arthritis (RA) algorithm on both RA and electronic health record (EHR) duration. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      Using a population-based cohort from the Mayo Clinic Biobank, we identified 497 patients with at least 1 RA diagnosis code. RA case status was manually determined using validated criteria for RA. RA duration was defined as time from first RA code to the index date of biobank enrollment. To simulate EHR duration, various years of EHR lookback were applied, starting at the index date and going backward. Model performance was determined by sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and area under the curve (AUC). Results:
      
    

    
      The eMERGE algorithm performed well in this cohort, with overall sensitivity 53%, specificity 99%, positive predictive value 97%, negative predictive value 74%, and AUC 76%. Among patients with RA duration <2 years, sensitivity and AUC were only 9% and 54%, respectively, but increased to 71% and 85% among patients with RA duration >10 years. Longer EHR lookback also improved model performance up to a threshold of 10 years, in which sensitivity reached 52% and AUC 75%. However, optimal EHR lookback varied by RA duration; an EHR lookback of 3 years was best able to identify recently diagnosed RA cases. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      eMERGE algorithm performance improves with longer RA duration as well as EHR duration up to 10 years, though shorter EHR lookback can improve identification of recently diagnosed RA cases.","['1 Division of Rheumatology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', '2 Division of Digital Health Sciences, Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', ""3 Division of Rheumatology, Inflammation, and Immunity, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."", '4 Division of Biomedical Statistics and Informatics, Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.']","Vanessa L Kronzer, Liwei Wang, Hongfang Liu, John M Davis, Jeffrey A Sparks, Cynthia S Crowson, ",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2020,algorithm; eMERGE; electronic health record; natural language processing; rheumatoid arthritis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32134444
788,Validation of a Semiautomated Natural Language Processing-Based Procedure for Meta-Analysis of Cancer Susceptibility Gene Penetrance,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      Quantifying the risk of cancer associated with pathogenic mutations in germline cancer susceptibility genes-that is, penetrance-enables the personalization of preventive management strategies. Conducting a meta-analysis is the best way to obtain robust risk estimates. We have previously developed a natural language processing (NLP) -based abstract classifier which classifies abstracts as relevant to penetrance, prevalence of mutations, both, or neither. In this work, we evaluate the performance of this NLP-based procedure. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      We compared the semiautomated NLP-based procedure, which involves automated abstract classification and text mining, followed by human review of identified studies, with the traditional procedure that requires human review of all studies. Ten high-quality gene-cancer penetrance meta-analyses spanning 16 gene-cancer associations were used as the gold standard by which to evaluate the performance of our procedure. For each meta-analysis, we evaluated the number of abstracts that required human review (workload) and the ability to identify the studies that were included by the authors in their quantitative analysis (coverage). Results:
      
    

    
      Compared with the traditional procedure, the semiautomated NLP-based procedure led to a lower workload across all 10 meta-analyses, with an overall 84% reduction (2,774 abstracts v 16,941 abstracts) in the amount of human review required. Overall coverage was 93%-we are able to identify 132 of 142 studies-before reviewing references of identified studies. Reasons for the 10 missed studies included blank and poorly written abstracts. After reviewing references, nine of the previously missed studies were identified and coverage improved to 99% (141 of 142 studies). Conclusion:
      
    

    
      We demonstrated that an NLP-based procedure can significantly reduce the review workload without compromising the ability to identify relevant studies. NLP algorithms have promising potential for reducing human efforts in the literature review process.","['1 Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA.', '2 Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston, MA.', '3 Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA.', '4 Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', '5 Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.']","Zhengyi Deng, Kanhua Yin, Yujia Bao, Victor Diego Armengol, Cathy Wang, Ankur Tiwari, Regina Barzilay, Giovanni Parmigiani, Danielle Braun, Kevin S Hughes, ",JCO clinical cancer informatics,2019 Aug,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31419182
789,Dendritic Cells in HIV/SIV Prophylactic and Therapeutic Vaccination,"Dendritic cells (DCs) are involved in human and simian immunodeficiency virus (HIV and SIV) pathogenesis but also play a critical role in orchestrating innate and adaptive vaccine-specific immune responses. Effective HIV/SIV vaccines require strong antigen-specific CD4 T cell responses, cytotoxic activity of CD8 T cells, and neutralizing/non-neutralizing antibody production at mucosal and systemic sites. To develop a protective HIV/SIV vaccine, vaccine regimens including DCs themselves, protein, DNA, mRNA, virus vectors, and various combinations have been evaluated in different animal and human models. Recent studies have shown that DCs enhanced prophylactic HIV/SIV vaccine efficacy by producing pro-inflammatory cytokines, improving T cell responses, and recruiting effector cells to target tissues. DCs are also targets for therapeutic HIV/SIV vaccines due to their ability to reverse latency, present antigen, and augment T and B cell immunity. Here, we review the complex interactions of DCs over the course of HIV/SIV prophylactic and therapeutic immunizations, providing new insights into development of advanced DC-targeted HIV/SIV vaccines.","['1 College of Veterinary Medicine, Jeju National University, Jeju 63243, Korea.', '2 Interdisciplinary Graduate Program in Advanced Convergence Technology & Science, Jeju National University, Jeju 63243, Korea.', '3 Vaccine Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']","Eun-Ju Ko, Marjorie Robert-Guroff, ",Viruses,2019,antigen-specific responses; dendritic cells; human/simian immunodeficiency virus; vaccine.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31878130

Therapeutic cancer vaccines capable of generating durable and specific immunity against these HPV16 antigens hold great promise to achieve long-term disease control. Here we show in mice that HPV16 E7 RNA-LPX, an intravenously administered cancer vaccine based on immuno-pharmacologically optimized antigen-encoding mRNA, efficiently primes and expands antigen-specific effector and memory CD8+ T cells. HPV-positive TC-1 and C3 tumors of immunized mice are heavily infiltrated with activated immune cells and HPV16-specific T cells and are polarized towards a proinflammatory, cytotoxic and less immune-suppressive contexture. E7 RNA-LPX immunization mediates complete and durable remission of progressing tumors. Circulating memory T cells are highly cytotoxic and protect from tumor rechallenge. Moreover, E7 RNA-LPX immunization sensitizes anti-PD-L1 refractory tumors to checkpoint blockade. In conclusion, our data highlight the potential of HPV16 RNA-LPX for the treatment of HPV-driven cancers.","['1 Biopharmaceutical New Technologies (BioNTech) Corporation, Mainz, Germany.', '2 Research Center for Immunotherapy (FZI), University Medical Center Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', '3 TRON - Translational Oncology at the University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University gGmbH, Mainz, Germany.']","Christian Grunwitz, Nadja Salomon, Fulvia Vascotto, Abderaouf Selmi, Thomas Bukur, Mustafa Diken, Sebastian Kreiter, Özlem Türeci, Ugur Sahin, ",Oncoimmunology,2019,Cancer vaccine; E7; HPV 16 RNA-LPX; HPV16-positive malignancies; T cell memory.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31428528
791,MAGPEL: an autoMated pipeline for inferring vAriant-driven Gene PanEls from the full-length biomedical literature,"In spite of the efforts in developing and maintaining accurate variant databases, a large number of disease-associated variants are still hidden in the biomedical literature. Curation of the biomedical literature in an effort to extract this information is a challenging task due to: (i) the complexity of natural language processing, (ii) inconsistent use of standard recommendations for variant description, and (iii) the lack of clarity and consistency in describing the variant-genotype-phenotype associations in the biomedical literature. In this article, we employ text mining and word cloud analysis techniques to address these challenges. The proposed framework extracts the variant-gene-disease associations from the full-length biomedical literature and designs an evidence-based variant-driven gene panel for a given condition. We validate the identified genes by showing their diagnostic abilities to predict the patients' clinical outcome on several independent validation cohorts. As representative examples, we present our results for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), breast cancer and prostate cancer. We compare these panels with other variant-driven gene panels obtained from Clinvar, Mastermind and others from literature, as well as with a panel identified with a classical differentially expressed genes (DEGs) approach. The results show that the panels obtained by the proposed framework yield better results than the other gene panels currently available in the literature.","['1 Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA.', '2 Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA.

792,Using word embeddings to improve the privacy of clinical notes,"Objective:
      
    

    
      In this work, we introduce a privacy technique for anonymizing clinical notes that guarantees all private health information is secured (including sensitive data, such as family history, that are not adequately covered by current techniques). Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      We employ a new ""random replacement"" paradigm (replacing each token in clinical notes with neighboring word vectors from the embedding space) to achieve 100% recall on the removal of sensitive information, unachievable with current ""search-and-secure"" paradigms. We demonstrate the utility of this paradigm on multiple corpora in a diverse set of classification tasks. Results:
      
    

    
      We empirically evaluate the effect of our anonymization technique both on upstream and downstream natural language processing tasks to show that our perturbations, while increasing security (ie, achieving 100% recall on any dataset), do not greatly impact the results of end-to-end machine learning approaches. Discussion:
      
    

    
      As long as current approaches utilize precision and recall to evaluate deidentification algorithms, there will remain a risk of overlooking sensitive information. Inspired by differential privacy, we sought to make it statistically infeasible to recreate the original data, although at the cost of readability. We hope that the work will serve as a catalyst to further research into alternative deidentification methods that can address current weaknesses. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Our proposed technique can secure clinical texts at a low cost and extremely high recall with a readability trade-off while remaining useful for natural language processing classification tasks. We hope that our work can be used by risk-averse data holders to release clinical texts to researchers.","['1 ICES, Toronto, Canada.', '2 The Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Toronto, Canada.', '3 Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', '4 Computational Statistics & Machine Learning Group, Department of Statistics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', '5 Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', '6 Harvard Medical School, Harvard University, Boston, USA.', ""7 International Centre for Surgical Safety, Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute, St Michael's Hospital, Toronto, Canada.""]","Mohamed Abdalla, Moustafa Abdalla, Frank Rudzicz, Graeme Hirst, ",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2020,: privacy; data anonymization; natural language processing; personal health records.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32388549
793,Nucleic acid vaccines for hepatitis B and C virus,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections accounts for an important global health problem affecting over 250 million people all around the world. They can cause acute, transient and chronic infections in the human liver. Chronic infection of liver can lead to its failure or cancer. To deal with this problem, alternative approaches or strategies to inhibit these infections have already been started. DNA and mRNA-based vaccination will increase the efficacy and reduce toxicity in patients with Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. Gene vaccines represent a promising alternative to conventional vaccine approaches because of their high potency, capacity for rapid development, low-cost manufacture and safe administration. MRNA-based vaccination is a method to elicit potent antigen-specific humoral and cell-mediated immune responses with a superior safety profile compared with DNA vaccines. Exploring the intricacies of these pathways can potentially help the researchers to explore newer vaccines. In this study, DNA and mRNA-based vaccination are introduced as an approach to treat Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. DNA and mRNA-based vaccines as one of the most successful therapeutics are introduced and the clinical outcomes of their exploitation are explained.","['1 Department of Molecular Genetics, Ahar Branch, Islamic Azad University, Ahar, Iran.', '2 Department of Molecular Genetics, Ahar Branch, Islamic Azad University, Ahar, Iran.

794,Codelivery of mRNA with α-Galactosylceramide Using a New Lipopolyplex Formulation Induces a Strong Antitumor Response upon Intravenous Administration,"Recently, the use of mRNA-based vaccines for cancer immunotherapy has gained growing attention. Several studies have shown that mRNA delivered in a vectorized format can generate a robust and efficient immune response. In this work, a new lipopolyplex vector (multi-LP), incorporating the immune adjuvant α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer) and a multivalent cationic lipid, was proposed for the in vivo delivery of mRNA into antigen-presenting cells. We demonstrate that dendritic cells (DCs) can be targeted in vivo by intravenous administration of a α-GalCer-/mRNA-loaded multi-LP vector, without the need for its functionalization with cell-specific antibodies or ligands. The multi-LP nanoparticles loaded with a reporter mRNA efficiently led to high expression of the enhanced green fluorescence protein in DCs both in vitro and in vivo, exhibiting an intrinsic selectivity for DCs. Finally, the TRP2-mRNA/α-GalCer-based multi-LP vaccine induced a significant therapeutic effect against a highly malignant B16-F10 melanoma tumor. This study provides the first evidence that a combination of antigen-mRNA and α-GalCer can be used as an effective antitumor vaccine, inducing strong innate and adaptive immune responses.","[""1 Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO) Research Institute, Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa K1N 6N5, Canada."", '2 Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT), Via Morego 30, Genova 16163, Italy.']","Maria L Guevara, Zachary Jilesen, David Stojdl, Stefano Persano, ",ACS omega,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31460428

      Manual systematic literature reviews are becoming increasingly challenging due to the sharp rise in publications. The primary objective of this literature review was to compare manual and computer software using artificial intelligence retrieval of publications on the cutaneous manifestations of primary SS, but we also evaluated the prevalence of cutaneous manifestations in primary SS. Methods:
      
    

    
      We compared manual searching and searching with the in-house computer software BIbliography BOT (BIBOT) designed for article retrieval and analysis. Both methods were used for a systematic literature review on a complex topic, i.e. the cutaneous manifestations of primary SS. Reproducibility was estimated by computing Cohen's κ coefficients and was interpreted as follows: slight, 0-0.20; fair, 0.21-0.40; moderate, 0.41-0.60; substantial, 0.61-0.80; and almost perfect, 0.81-1. Results:
      
    

    
      The manual search retrieved 855 articles and BIBOT 1042 articles. In all, 202 articles were then selected by applying exclusion criteria. Among them, 155 were retrieved by both methods, 33 by manual search only, and 14 by BIBOT only. Reliability (κ = 0.84) was almost perfect. Further selection was performed by reading the 202 articles. Cohort sizes and the nature and prevalence of cutaneous manifestations varied across publications. In all, we found 52 cutaneous manifestations reported in primary SS patients. The most described ones were cutaneous vasculitis (561 patients), xerosis (651 patients) and annular erythema (215 patients). Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Among the final selection of 202 articles, 155/202 (77%) were found by the two methods but BIBOT was faster and automatically classified the articles in a chart.

796,Immunogenicity of RNA Replicons Encoding HIV Env Immunogens Designed for Self-Assembly into Nanoparticles,"RNA replicons are a promising platform technology for vaccines. To evaluate the potential of lipid nanoparticle-formulated replicons for delivery of HIV immunogens, we designed and tested an alphavirus replicon expressing a self-assembling protein nanoparticle immunogen, the glycoprotein 120 (gp120) germline-targeting engineered outer domain (eOD-GT8) 60-mer. The eOD-GT8 immunogen is a germline-targeting antigen designed to prime human B cells capable of evolving toward VRC01-class broadly neutralizing antibodies. Replicon RNA was encapsulated with high efficiency in 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP)-based lipid nanoparticles, which provided effective delivery in the muscle and expression of luciferase lasting ∼30 days in normal mice, contrasting with very brief and low levels of expression obtained by delivery of equivalent modified mRNA (modRNA). eOD-GT8 60-mer-encoding replicons elicited high titers of gp120-specific antibodies following a single injection in mice, and increased levels of antigen-specific germinal center B cells compared with protein immunization. Immunization of transgenic mice expressing human inferred-germline VRC01 heavy chain B cell receptors that are the targets of the eOD antigen led to priming of B cells and somatic hypermutation consistent with VRC01-class antibody development. Altogether, these data suggest replicon delivery of Env immunogens may be a promising avenue for HIV vaccine development.","['1 Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA; Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology and Immunogen Discovery, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.', '2 Synthetic Biology Center, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA.', '3 Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA.', '4 Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA; Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology and Immunogen Discovery, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA.', '5 Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology and Immunogen Discovery, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA; Immunology and Microbial Science, TSRI, La Jolla, CA, USA.', '6 Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology and Immunogen Discovery, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA; International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA; Immunology and Microbial Science, TSRI, La Jolla, CA, USA.', '7 Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology and Immunogen Discovery, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA; International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA; Immunology and Microbial Science, TSRI, La Jolla, CA, USA; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.', '8 Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA; Synthetic Biology Center, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA; Department of Biological Engineering, MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA.', '9 Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA; Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology and Immunogen Discovery, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA; Department of Biological Engineering, MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA; Materials Science & Engineering, MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Chevy Chase, MD, USA.

In this study, the relations between 2 medical concepts are classified by simultaneously learning representations of text segments in the context of sentence syntactic dependency: preceding, concept1, middle, concept2, and succeeding segments. Seg-GCRN was systematically evaluated on the i2b2/VA relation classification challenge datasets. Experiments show that Seg-GCRN attains state-of-the-art micro-averaged F-measure for all 3 relation categories: 0.692 for classifying medical treatment-problem relations, 0.827 for medical test-problem relations, and 0.741 for medical problem-medical problem relations.

      The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is perhaps the greatest global health challenge of the last century. Accompanying this pandemic is a parallel ""infodemic,"" including the online marketing and sale of unapproved, illegal, and counterfeit COVID-19 health products including testing kits, treatments, and other questionable ""cures."" Enabling the proliferation of this content is the growing ubiquity of internet-based technologies, including popular social media platforms that now have billions of global users. Objective:
      
    

    
      This study aims to collect, analyze, identify, and enable reporting of suspected fake, counterfeit, and unapproved COVID-19-related health care products from Twitter and Instagram. Methods:
      
    

    
      This study is conducted in two phases beginning with the collection of COVID-19-related Twitter and Instagram posts using a combination of web scraping on Instagram and filtering the public streaming Twitter application programming interface for keywords associated with suspect marketing and sale of COVID-19 products. The second phase involved data analysis using natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning to identify potential sellers that were then manually annotated for characteristics of interest. We also visualized illegal selling posts on a customized data dashboard to enable public health intelligence. Results:
      
    

    
      We collected a total of 6,029,323 tweets and 204,597 Instagram posts filtered for terms associated with suspect marketing and sale of COVID-19 health products from March to April for Twitter and February to May for Instagram. After applying our NLP and deep learning approaches, we identified 1271 tweets and 596 Instagram posts associated with questionable sales of COVID-19-related products. Generally, product introduction came in two waves, with the first consisting of questionable immunity-boosting treatments and a second involving suspect testing kits. We also detected a low volume of pharmaceuticals that have not been approved for COVID-19 treatment. Other major themes detected included products offered in different languages, various claims of product credibility, completely unsubstantiated products, unapproved testing modalities, and different payment and seller contact methods. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Results from this study provide initial insight into one front of the ""infodemic"" fight against COVID-19 by characterizing what types of health products, selling claims, and types of sellers were active on two popular social media platforms at earlier stages of the pandemic. This cybercrime challenge is likely to continue as the pandemic progresses and more people seek access to COVID-19 testing and treatment.

However, the success of NNs remains dependent on the availability of large labelled datasets, such as in the case of electronic health records (EHRs). With scarce data, NNs are unlikely to be able to extract this hidden information with practical accuracy. In this study, we develop an approach that solves these problems for named entity recognition, obtaining 94.6 F1 score in I2B2 2009 Medical Extraction Challenge (Uzuner et al., 2010), 4.3 above the architecture that won the competition. To achieve this, we bootstrap our NN models through transfer learning by pretraining word embeddings on a secondary task performed on a large pool of unannotated EHRs and using the output embeddings as a foundation of a range of NN architectures. Beyond the official I2B2 challenge, we further achieve 82.4 F1 on extracting relationships between medical terms using attention-based seq2seq models bootstrapped in the same manner.","['1 University of Oxford, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

801,Challenges in the construction of knowledge bases for human microbiome-disease associations,"The last few years have seen tremendous growth in human microbiome research, with a particular focus on the links to both mental and physical health and disease. Medical and experimental settings provide initial sources of information about these links, but individual studies produce disconnected pieces of knowledge bounded in context by the perspective of expert researchers reading full-text publications. Building a knowledge base (KB) consolidating these disconnected pieces is an essential first step to democratize and accelerate the process of accessing the collective discoveries of human disease connections to the human microbiome. In this article, we survey the existing tools and development efforts that have been produced to capture portions of the information needed to construct a KB of all known human microbiome-disease associations and highlight the need for additional innovations in natural language processing (NLP), text mining, taxonomic representations, and field-wide vocabulary standardization in human microbiome research. Addressing these challenges will enable the construction of KBs that help identify new insights amenable to experimental validation and potentially clinical decision support.","['1 Center for Microbiome Innovation, Jacobs School of Engineering, University of California, San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', '2 Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', '3 Scalable Knowledge Intelligence, IBM Research-Almaden, 650 Harry Road, San Jose, CA 95120, USA.', '4 UCSD Health Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', '5 Department of Bioengineering, University of California, San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', '6 Center for Microbiome Innovation, Jacobs School of Engineering, University of California, San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA. chunnan@ucsd.edu.', '7 Department of Neurosciences and Center for Research in Biological Systems, University of California, San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA. chunnan@ucsd.edu.']","Varsha Dave Badal, Dustin Wright, Yannis Katsis, Ho-Cheol Kim, Austin D Swafford, Rob Knight, Chun-Nan Hsu, ",Microbiome,2019,Disease; Human; Knowledge base; Microbes; Microbiome; Microbiome dynamics; Model organisms; Natural language processing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31488215

803,Automatic Methods to Extract Prescription Status Quality Measures from Unstructured Health Records,"Hospital systems frequently implement quality measures to quantify healthcare processes and patient outcomes. One such measure that has previously been used is the Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP) quality measure of perioperative beta blocker continuation, SCIP-Card-2. The SCIP-Card-2 measure requires resource-intensive medical chart abstraction, limiting its application to a small sample of eligible patients. This paper describes a natural language processing (NLP) system for automatic extraction of SCIP-Card-2 quality measures in clinical text notes.","['1 VA Salt Lake City Health Care System.', '2 University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.', '3 Birmingham VAMC.', '4 University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL.']","Patrick R Alba, Olga V Patterson, Joshua S Richman, Scott L DuVall, ",Studies in health technology and informatics,2019,Health Resources; Natural language processing; Quality Indicators.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31437876
804,Enhancing ICD-Code-Based Case Definition for Heart Failure Using Electronic Medical Record Data,"Background:
      
    

    
      Surveillance and outcome studies for heart failure (HF) require accurate identification of patients with HF. Algorithms based on International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes to identify HF from administrative data are inadequate owing to their relatively low sensitivity. Detailed clinical information from electronic medical records (EMRs) is potentially useful for improving ICD algorithms. This study aimed to enhance the ICD algorithm for HF definition by incorporating comprehensive information from EMRs. Methods:
      
    

    
      The study included 2106 inpatients in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Medical chart review was used as the reference gold standard for evaluating developed algorithms. The commonly used ICD codes for defining HF were used (namely, the ICD algorithm). The performance of different algorithms using the free text discharge summaries from a population-based EMR were compared with the ICD algorithm. These algorithms included a keyword search algorithm looking for HF-specific terms, a machine learning-based HF concept (HFC) algorithm, an EMR structured data based algorithm, and combined algorithms (the ICD and HFC combined algorithm). Results:
      
    

    
      Of 2106 patients, 296 (14.1%) were patients with HF as determined by chart review. The ICD algorithm had 92.4% positive predictive value (PPV) but low sensitivity (57.4%). The EMR keyword search algorithm achieved a higher sensitivity (65.5%) than the ICD algorithm, but with a lower PPV (77.6%). The HFC algorithm achieved a better sensitivity (80.0%) and maintained a reasonable PPV (88.9%) compared with the ICD algorithm and the keyword algorithm. An even higher sensitivity (83.3%) was reached by combining the HFC and ICD algorithms, with a lower PPV (83.3%). The structured EMR data algorithm reached a sensitivity of 78% and a PPV of 54.2%. The combined EMR structured data and ICD algorithm had a higher sensitivity (82.4%), but the PPV remained low at 54.8%. All algorithms had a specificity ranging from 87.5% to 99.2%. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Applying natural language processing and machine learning on the discharge summaries of inpatient EMR data can improve the capture of cases of HF compared with the widely used ICD algorithm. The utility of the HFC algorithm is straightforward, making it easily applied for HF case identification.","['1 Department of Oncology, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada; Department of Surgery, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada; Department of Community Health Sciences, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada; Centre for Health Informatics, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

805,Feasibility of Natural Language Processing-Assisted Auditing of Critical Findings in Chest Radiology,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Time-sensitive communication of critical imaging findings like pneumothorax or pulmonary embolism to referring physicians is essential for patient safety. The definitive communication is the radiology free-text report. Quality assurance initiatives require that institutions audit these communications, a time-intensive manual task. We propose using a rule-based natural language processing system to improve the process for auditing critical findings communications. Methods:
      
    

    
      We present a pilot assessment of the feasibility of using an automated critical finding identification system to assist quality assurance teams' evaluation of critical findings communication compliance. Our assessment is based on chest imaging reports. Critical findings are identified in radiology reports using pyConTextNLP, an open source Python implementation of the ConText algorithm. Results:
      
    

    
      In our test set, there were 75 reports with critical findings and 591 reports without critical findings. pyConTextNLP correctly identified 69 of the positive cases with 8 false-positives for a sensitivity of 0.92 and a specificity of 0.99. Discussion:

806,Extractive summarization of clinical trial descriptions,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      Text summarization of clinical trial descriptions has the potential to reduce the time required to familiarize oneself with the subject of studies by condensing long-form detailed descriptions to concise, meaning-preserving synopses. This work describes the process and quality of automatically generated summaries of clinical trial descriptions using extractive text summarization methods. Methods:
      
    

    
      We generated a novel dataset from the detailed descriptions and brief summaries of trials registered on clinicaltrials.gov. We executed several text summarization algorithms on the detailed descriptions in this corpus and calculated the standard ROUGE metrics using the brief summaries included in the record as a reference. To investigate the correlation of these metrics with human sentiments, four reviewers assessed the content-completeness of the generated summaries and the helpfulness of both the generated and reference summaries via a Likert scale questionnaire. Results:
      
    

    
      The filtering stages of the dataset generation process reduce the 277,228 trials registered on clinicaltrials.gov to 101,016 records usable for the summarization task. On average, the summaries in this corpus are 25% the length of the detailed descriptions. Of the evaluated text summarization methods, the TextRank algorithm exhibits the overall best performance with a ROUGE-1 F1 score of 0.3531, ROUGE-2 F1 score of 0.1723, and ROUGE-L F1 score of 0.3003. These scores correlate with the assessment of the helpfulness and content similarity by the human reviewers. Inter-rater agreement for the helpfulness and content similarity was slight and fair respectively (Fleiss' kappa of 0.12 and 0.22). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Extractive summarization is a viable tool for generating meaning-preserving synopses of detailed clinical trial descriptions. Further, the human evaluation has shown that the ROUGE-L F1 score is useful for rating the general quality of generated summaries of clinical trial descriptions in an automated way.","['1 Medical Informatics, Friedrich-Alexander Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany.

807,Sentiment Analysis in Health and Well-Being: Systematic Review,"Background:
      
    

    
      Sentiment analysis (SA) is a subfield of natural language processing whose aim is to automatically classify the sentiment expressed in a free text. It has found practical applications across a wide range of societal contexts including marketing, economy, and politics. This review focuses specifically on applications related to health, which is defined as ""a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity."" Objective:
      
    

    
      This study aimed to establish the state of the art in SA related to health and well-being by conducting a systematic review of the recent literature. To capture the perspective of those individuals whose health and well-being are affected, we focused specifically on spontaneously generated content and not necessarily that of health care professionals. Methods:
      
    

    
      Our methodology is based on the guidelines for performing systematic reviews. In January 2019, we used PubMed, a multifaceted interface, to perform a literature search against MEDLINE. We identified a total of 86 relevant studies and extracted data about the datasets analyzed, discourse topics, data creators, downstream applications, algorithms used, and their evaluation. Results:
      
    

    
      The majority of data were collected from social networking and Web-based retailing platforms. The primary purpose of online conversations is to exchange information and provide social support online. These communities tend to form around health conditions with high severity and chronicity rates. Different treatments and services discussed include medications, vaccination, surgery, orthodontic services, individual physicians, and health care services in general. We identified 5 roles with respect to health and well-being among the authors of the types of spontaneously generated narratives considered in this review: a sufferer, an addict, a patient, a carer, and a suicide victim. Out of 86 studies considered, only 4 reported the demographic characteristics. A wide range of methods were used to perform SA. Most common choices included support vector machines, naïve Bayesian learning, decision trees, logistic regression, and adaptive boosting. In contrast with general trends in SA research, only 1 study used deep learning. The performance lags behind the state of the art achieved in other domains when measured by F-score, which was found to be below 60% on average. In the context of SA, the domain of health and well-being was found to be resource poor: few domain-specific corpora and lexica are shared publicly for research purposes. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      SA results in the area of health and well-being lag behind those in other domains. It is yet unclear if this is because of the intrinsic differences between the domains and their respective sublanguages, the size of training datasets, the lack of domain-specific sentiment lexica, or the choice of algorithms.","['1 School of Computer Science & Informatics, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom.']","Anastazia Zunic, Padraig Corcoran, Irena Spasic, ",JMIR medical informatics,2020,machine learning; natural language processing; sentiment analysis; text mining.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32012057
808,Process alarm prediction using deep learning and word embedding methods,"Industrial alarm systems play an essential role for the safe management of process operations. With the increase in automation and instrumentation of modern process plants, the number of alarms that the operators manage has also increased significantly. The operators are expected to make critical decisions in the presence of flooding alarms, poorly configured and maintained alarms and many nuisance alarms. In this environment, if the incoming alarms can be correctly predicted before they actually occur, the operators may have a chance to address and possibly avoid abnormal behaviors by taking corrective actions in time. Inspired by the application of deep learning in natural language processing, this paper presents an alarm prediction method based on word embedding and recurrent neural networks to predict the next alarm in a process setting. This represents both a novel approach to alarm management as well as a novel application of natural language processing and deep learning techniques to this problem. The proposed method is applied to an actual case study to demonstrate its performance.","['1 College of Safety and Ocean Engineering, State Key Laboratory of Petroleum Resources and Prospecting, China University of Petroleum, Beijing, China; Department of Chemical Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA 95616, USA.', '2 Department of Chemical Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA 95616, USA.', '3 College of Safety and Ocean Engineering, State Key Laboratory of Petroleum Resources and Prospecting, China University of Petroleum, Beijing, China.', '4 College of Safety and Ocean Engineering, State Key Laboratory of Petroleum Resources and Prospecting, China University of Petroleum, Beijing, China.

809,Investigation of charge ratio variation in mRNA - DEAE-dextran polyplex delivery systems,"mRNA pharmaceuticals represent a new class of therapeutics, with applications, in cancer vaccination, tumour therapy and protein substitution. Formulations are required to deliver messenger RNA (mRNA) to the target sites where induction of genetic transfection following receptor mediated cell uptake & translation is required. In the current study, the cationic polysaccharide diethylaminoethylen (DEAE) - Dextran was selected as a model system carrier for the investigation of polyplex nanoparticle formation together with mRNA as a function of the molar ratio of the components. The structure of the mRNA/Dextran colloids was investigated as a function of the polymer-to-mRNA ratio and correlated with the biological activity determined by cellular transfection with luciferase coding mRNA. Dynamic light scattering (DLS), small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), and small angle neutron scattering (SANS) with deuterium contrast variation were used to achieve structural insight into the systems. Similarly to previously investigated lipid based systems, colloidally stable particles with confined size were obtained with either excess of positive or negative charge. Highest activity was obtained with positive charge excess. From the scattering experiments information on the internal organization inside the polymer/mRNA systems was derived. Indication for the presence of structural elements in the length scale of ten to 20 nm were found in the excess of dextran, which could be due to either excess or particulate polymer. Information on the molecular organization of the mRNA nanoparticle products may provide a valuable basis for defining critical quality attributes of drug products for pharmaceutical application.","['1 Department of Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceutics, Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, D-55099, Mainz, Germany.', '2 BioNTech RNA Pharmaceuticals GmbH, D-55131, Mainz, Germany.', '3 European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) Hamburg Outstation c/o DESY, D-22603, Hamburg, Germany.', '4 Jülich Centre for Neutron Science JCNS at Heinz Maier-Leibnitz Zentrum MLZ, D-85748, Garching, Germany.', '5 IIIrd Dept. of Medicine, Johannes Gutenberg-University Medical Center, Johannes Gutenberg-University, D-55131, Mainz, Germany.', '6 BioNTech RNA Pharmaceuticals GmbH, D-55131, Mainz, Germany; Exp.

810,Ground Glass Lesions on Chest Imaging: Evaluation of Reported Incidence in Cancer Patients Using Natural Language Processing,"Background:
      
    

    
      Ground glass opacities (GGOs) on computed tomography (CT) have gained significant recent attention, with unclear incidence and epidemiologic patterns. Natural language processing (NLP) is a powerful computing tool that collects variables from unstructured data fields. Our objective was to characterize trends of GGO detection using NLP. Methods:
      
    

    
      Patients were identified at a large quaternary referral center who underwent chest CT from 2000 to 2016 via query of institutional databases. NLP was used to identify imaging reports with GGOs and to obtain additional demographic data. Incidence of reported GGOs was tracked over time. Multivariate regression was used to identify predictors of GGOs identified on chest CT. Results:
      
    

    
      A total of 244,391 chest CTs were included, with 35,386 (14.5%) revealing GGOs. There was a significant relationship between advancing year of chest CT and likelihood of reported GGOs (p < 0.001). GGOs were more likely to occur in older subjects (60.5 vs 58.5 years, p < 0.001), males (54.6% vs 51.5%, p < 0.001), and nonwhite races (21.2% Asian, 15.6% Hispanic, 14.4% black, 14.0% white; p < 0.001). Certain occupational histories predicted more frequent GGOs (p < 0.001), including transportation labor (47.4%), metal workers (42.3%), iron workers (33.3%), cabinetry (32.6%), and foremen (29.6%). Multivariate regression revealed age, sex, nonsmokers, increasing year of chest CT, and race as significant independent predictors of identifying GGOs. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      NLP explored a large cohort of patients who underwent chest CT over the study period. Demographic features predicting reported GGOs include age, sex, race, and occupation. GGO recognition continues to increase with time, and further studies investigating etiology and prognostic implications are necessary.","['1 Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', '2 Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.

811,Enhancing predictions of patient conveyance using emergency call handler free text notes for unconscious and fainting incidents reported to the London Ambulance Service,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Pre-hospital emergency medical services use clinical decision support systems (CDSS) to triage calls. Call handlers often supplement this by making free text notes covering key incident information. We investigate whether machine learning approaches using features from such free text notes can improve prediction of unconscious patients who require conveyance. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      We analysed a subset of all London Ambulance Service calls that were triaged through the Medical Priority Dispatch System (MPDS) as involving an unconscious or fainting patient in 2018. We use and compare two machine learning algorithms: random forest (RF) and gradient boosting machine (GBM). For each incident, we predict whether the patient will be conveyed to a hospital emergency department or equivalent using as features 1) the MPDS code, 2) the free text notes and 3) the two together. We evaluate model performance using the area under the curve (AUC) metric. Given the imbalance of outcomes (patient conveyed 71 %, not conveyed 29 %), we also consider sensitivity and specificity. Results:
      
    

    
      Using only the MPDS code resulted in an AUC of 0.57. Using the text notes gave an improved AUC score of 0.63 and combining the two gave an AUC score of 0.64 (scores were similar for RF and GBM). GBM models scored better on sensitivity (0.93 vs 0.62 for RF in the combined model), but specificity was lower (0.17 vs. 0.56 for RF in the combined model). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Using information contained in the free text notes made by call handlers in combination with MPDS improves prediction of unconscious and fainting patients requiring conveyance to a hospital emergency department (or equivalent) when compared with machine learning models using MPDS codes only. This suggests there is some useful information in unstructured data captured by emergency call handlers that complements MPDS codes. Quantifying this gain can help inform emergency medical service policy when evaluating the decision to expand or augment existing CDSS.","[""1 Centre for Urban Science and Progress Studies, King's College London, UK."", '2 Forecasting and Planning, London Ambulance Service NHS Trust, UK.', ""3 Centre for Urban Science and Progress Studies, King's College London, UK; Institute for Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, UK.

812,Extraction of Information Related to Drug Safety Surveillance From Electronic Health Record Notes: Joint Modeling of Entities and Relations Using Knowledge-Aware Neural Attentive Models,"Background:
      
    

    
      An adverse drug event (ADE) is commonly defined as ""an injury resulting from medical intervention related to a drug."" Providing information related to ADEs and alerting caregivers at the point of care can reduce the risk of prescription and diagnostic errors and improve health outcomes. ADEs captured in structured data in electronic health records (EHRs) as either coded problems or allergies are often incomplete, leading to underreporting. Therefore, it is important to develop capabilities to process unstructured EHR data in the form of clinical notes, which contain a richer documentation of a patient's ADE. Several natural language processing (NLP) systems have been proposed to automatically extract information related to ADEs. However, the results from these systems showed that significant improvement is still required for the automatic extraction of ADEs from clinical notes. Objective:
      
    

    
      This study aims to improve the automatic extraction of ADEs and related information such as drugs, their attributes, and reason for administration from the clinical notes of patients. Methods:
      
    

    
      This research was conducted using discharge summaries from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database obtained through the 2018 National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2) annotated with drugs, drug attributes (ie, strength, form, frequency, route, dosage, duration), ADEs, reasons, and relations between drugs and other entities. We developed a deep learning-based system for extracting these drug-centric concepts and relations simultaneously using a joint method enhanced with contextualized embeddings, a position-attention mechanism, and knowledge representations. The joint method generated different sentence representations for each drug, which were then used to extract related concepts and relations simultaneously. Contextualized representations trained on the MIMIC-III database were used to capture context-sensitive meanings of words. The position-attention mechanism amplified the benefits of the joint method by generating sentence representations that capture long-distance relations. Knowledge representations were obtained from graph embeddings created using the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System database to improve relation extraction, especially when contextual clues were insufficient. Results:
      
    

    
      Our system achieved new state-of-the-art results on the n2c2 data set, with significant improvements in recognizing crucial drug-reason (F1=0.650 versus F1=0.579) and drug-ADE (F1=0.490 versus F1=0.476) relations. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      This study presents a system for extracting drug-centric concepts and relations that outperformed current state-of-the-art results and shows that contextualized embeddings, position-attention mechanisms, and knowledge graph embeddings effectively improve deep learning-based concepts and relation extraction. This study demonstrates the potential for deep learning-based methods to help extract real-world evidence from unstructured patient data for drug safety surveillance.","['1 IBM Research, Yorktown Heights, NY, United States.']","Bharath Dandala, Venkata Joopudi, Ching-Huei Tsou, Jennifer J Liang, Parthasarathy Suryanarayanan, ",JMIR medical informatics,2020,adverse drug events; adverse drug reaction reporting systems; deep learning; electronic health records; information extraction; named entity recognition; natural language processing; relation extraction.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32459650

      Identifying patients who meet selection criteria for clinical trials is typically challenging and time-consuming. In this article, we describe our clinical natural language processing (NLP) system to automatically assess patients' eligibility based on their longitudinal medical records. This work was part of the 2018 National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2) Shared-Task and Workshop on Cohort Selection for Clinical Trials. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      The authors developed an integrated rule-based clinical NLP system which employs a generic rule-based framework plugged in with lexical-, syntactic- and meta-level, task-specific knowledge inputs. In addition, the authors also implemented and evaluated a general clinical NLP (cNLP) system which is built with the Unified Medical Language System and Unstructured Information Management Architecture. Results and discussion:
      
    

    
      The systems were evaluated as part of the 2018 n2c2-1 challenge, and authors' rule-based system obtained an F-measure of 0.9028, ranking fourth at the challenge and had less than 1% difference from the best system. While the general cNLP system didn't achieve performance as good as the rule-based system, it did establish its own advantages and potential in extracting clinical concepts. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Our results indicate that a well-designed rule-based clinical NLP system is capable of achieving good performance on cohort selection even with a small training data set. In addition, the investigation of a Unified Medical Language System-based general cNLP system suggests that a hybrid system combining these 2 approaches is promising to surpass the state-of-the-art performance.","['1 Med Data Quest, Inc, La Jolla, California, USA.']","Long Chen, Yu Gu, Xin Ji, Chao Lou, Zhiyong Sun, Haodan Li, Yuan Gao, Yang Huang, ",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2019,UMLS; clinical natural language processing; clinical trial; cohort selection; rule-based system.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31300825
814,Neural side effect discovery from user credibility and experience-assessed online health discussions,"Background:
      
    

    
      Health 2.0 allows patients and caregivers to conveniently seek medical information and advice via e-portals and online discussion forums, especially regarding potential drug side effects. Although online health communities are helpful platforms for obtaining non-professional opinions, they pose risks in communicating unreliable and insufficient information in terms of quality and quantity. Existing methods in extracting user-reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in online health forums are not only insufficiently accurate as they disregard user credibility and drug experience, but are also expensive as they rely on supervised ground truth annotation of individual statement. We propose a NEural ArchiTecture for Drug side effect prediction (NEAT), which is optimized on the task of drug side effect discovery based on a complete discussion while being attentive to user credibility and experience, thus, addressing the mentioned shortcomings. We train our neural model in a self-supervised fashion using ground truth drug side effects from mayoclinic.org. NEAT learns to assign each user a score that is descriptive of their credibility and highlights the critical textual segments of their post. Results:
      
    

    
      Experiments show that NEAT improves drug side effect discovery from online health discussion by 3.04% from user-credibility agnostic baselines, and by 9.94% from non-neural baselines in term of F1. Additionally, the latent credibility scores learned by the model correlate well with trustworthiness signals, such as the number of ""thanks"" received by other forum members, and improve credibility heuristics such as number of posts by 0.113 in term of Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Experience-based self-supervised attention highlights critical phrases such as mentioned side effects, and enhances fully supervised ADR extraction models based on sequence labelling by 5.502% in terms of precision. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      NEAT considers both user credibility and experience in online health forums, making feasible a self-supervised approach to side effect prediction for mentioned drugs. The derived user credibility and attention mechanism are transferable and improve downstream ADR extraction models. Our approach enhances automatic drug side effect discovery and fosters research in several domains including pharmacovigilance and clinical studies.","['1 School of Computing, National University of Singapore, 13 Computing Drive, Singapore, 117417, Singapore. vhnguyen@u.nus.edu.', '2 School of Computing, National University of Singapore, 13 Computing Drive, Singapore, 117417, Singapore.']","Van-Hoang Nguyen, Kazunari Sugiyama, Min-Yen Kan, Kishaloy Halder, ",Journal of biomedical semantics,2020,Credibility analysis; Deep learning; Drug side effect discovery; Natural language processing; Online health communities.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32641159
815,Augmented intelligence with natural language processing applied to electronic health records for identifying patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease at risk for disease progression,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Electronic health record (EHR) systems contain structured data (such as diagnostic codes) and unstructured data (clinical documentation). Clinical insights can be derived from analyzing both. The use of natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to effectively analyze unstructured data has been well demonstrated. Here we examine the utility of NLP for the identification of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, assess patterns of disease progression, and identify gaps in care related to breakdown in communication among providers. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      All clinical notes available on the 38,575 patients enrolled in the Mount Sinai BioMe cohort were loaded into the NLP system. We compared analysis of structured and unstructured EHR data using NLP, free-text search, and diagnostic codes with validation against expert adjudication. We then used the NLP findings to measure physician impression of progression from early-stage NAFLD to NASH or cirrhosis. Similarly, we used the same NLP findings to identify mentions of NAFLD in radiology reports that did not persist into clinical notes. Results:
      
    

    
      Out of 38,575 patients, we identified 2,281 patients with NAFLD. From the remainder, 10,653 patients with similar data density were selected as a control group. NLP outperformed ICD and text search in both sensitivity (NLP: 0.93, ICD: 0.28, text search: 0.81) and F2 score (NLP: 0.92, ICD: 0.34, text search: 0.81). Of 2281 NAFLD patients, 673 (29.5%) were believed to have progressed to NASH or cirrhosis. Among 176 where NAFLD was noted prior to NASH, the average progression time was 410 days. 619 (27.1%) NAFLD patients had it documented only in radiology notes and not acknowledged in other forms of clinical documentation. Of these, 170 (28.4%) were later identified as having likely developed NASH or cirrhosis after a median 1057.3 days. Discussion:
      
    

    
      NLP-based approaches were more accurate at identifying NAFLD within the EHR than ICD/text search-based approaches. Suspected NAFLD on imaging is often not acknowledged in subsequent clinical documentation. Many such patients are later found to have more advanced liver disease. Analysis of information flows demonstrated loss of key information that could have been used to help prevent the progression of early NAFLD (NAFL) to NASH or cirrhosis. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      For identification of NAFLD, NLP performed better than alternative selection modalities. It then facilitated analysis of knowledge flow between physician and enabled the identification of breakdowns where key information was lost that could have slowed or prevented later disease progression.","['1 The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA.

816,Identification of suicidal behavior among psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents using natural language processing and machine learning of electronic health records,"Objective:
      
    

    
      The rapid proliferation of machine learning research using electronic health records to classify healthcare outcomes offers an opportunity to address the pressing public health problem of adolescent suicidal behavior. We describe the development and evaluation of a machine learning algorithm using natural language processing of electronic health records to identify suicidal behavior among psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents. Methods:
      
    

    
      Adolescents hospitalized on a psychiatric inpatient unit in a community health system in the northeastern United States were surveyed for history of suicide attempt in the past 12 months. A total of 73 respondents had electronic health records available prior to the index psychiatric admission. Unstructured clinical notes were downloaded from the year preceding the index inpatient admission. Natural language processing identified phrases from the notes associated with the suicide attempt outcome. We enriched this group of phrases with a clinically focused list of terms representing known risk and protective factors for suicide attempt in adolescents. We then applied the random forest machine learning algorithm to develop a classification model. The model performance was evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy. Results:
      
    

    
      The final model had a sensitivity of 0.83, specificity of 0.22, AUC of 0.68, a PPV of 0.42, NPV of 0.67, and an accuracy of 0.47. The terms mostly highly associated with suicide attempt clustered around terms related to suicide, family members, psychiatric disorders, and psychotropic medications. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      This analysis demonstrates modest success of a natural language processing and machine learning approach to identifying suicide attempt among a small sample of hospitalized adolescents in a psychiatric setting.","['1 Health Equity Research Lab, Cambridge Health Alliance, Cambridge, MA, United States of America.', '2 Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States of America.', '3 Prevention and Community Health Department, Milken School of Public Health, George Washington University, Washington, D.C., United States of America.', '4 Department of Psychiatry, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, United States of America.', '5 University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, United States of America.']","Nicholas J Carson, Brian Mullin, Maria Jose Sanchez, Frederick Lu, Kelly Yang, Michelle Menezes, Benjamin Lê Cook, ",PloS one,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30779800

      Automated understanding of consumer health inquiries might be hindered by misspellings. To detect and correct various types of spelling errors in consumer health questions, we developed a distributable spell-checking tool, CSpell, that handles nonword errors, real-word errors, word boundary infractions, punctuation errors, and combinations of the above. Methods:
      
    

    
      We developed a novel approach of using dual embedding within Word2vec for context-dependent corrections. This technique was used in combination with dictionary-based corrections in a 2-stage ranking system. We also developed various splitters and handlers to correct word boundary infractions. All correction approaches are integrated to handle errors in consumer health questions. Results:
      
    

    
      Our approach achieves an F1 score of 80.93% and 69.17% for spelling error detection and correction, respectively. Discussion:
      
    

    
      The dual-embedding model shows a significant improvement (9.13%) in F1 score compared with the general practice of using cosine similarity with word vectors in Word2vec for context ranking. Our 2-stage ranking system shows a 4.94% improvement in F1 score compared with the best 1-stage ranking system. Conclusion:

818,ClinPhen extracts and prioritizes patient phenotypes directly from medical records to expedite genetic disease diagnosis,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      Diagnosing monogenic diseases facilitates optimal care, but can involve the manual evaluation of hundreds of genetic variants per case. Computational tools like Phrank expedite this process by ranking all candidate genes by their ability to explain the patient's phenotypes. To use these tools, busy clinicians must manually encode patient phenotypes from lengthy clinical notes. With 100 million human genomes estimated to be sequenced by 2025, a fast alternative to manual phenotype extraction from clinical notes will become necessary. Methods:
      
    

    
      We introduce ClinPhen, a fast, high-accuracy tool that automatically converts clinical notes into a prioritized list of patient phenotypes using Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms. Results:
      
    

    
      ClinPhen shows superior accuracy and 20× speedup over existing phenotype extractors, and its novel phenotype prioritization scheme improves the performance of gene-ranking tools. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      While a dedicated clinician can process 200 patient records in a 40-hour workweek, ClinPhen does the same in 10 minutes. Compared with manual phenotype extraction, ClinPhen saves an additional 3-5 hours per Mendelian disease diagnosis. Providers can now add ClinPhen's output to each summary note attached to a filled testing laboratory request form. ClinPhen makes a substantial contribution to improvements in efficiency critically needed to meet the surging demand for clinical diagnostic sequencing.","['1 Department of Computer Science, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', '2 Department of Pediatrics, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', '3 Stanford Center for Undiagnosed Diseases, Stanford, CA, USA.', '4 Department of Biomedical Data Science, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', ""5 The Manton Center for Orphan Disease Research, Division of Genetics and Genomics, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", '6 Department of Pediatrics, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC, USA.', '7 Department of Human Genetics, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', '8 Department of Pediatrics, Division of Medical Genetics, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', '9 Department of Psychiatry, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', '10 Department of Medicine, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', '11 Department of Pediatrics, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.

Research Design and Method An explanatory mixed-methods design was utilized. Two hundred ""initial"" and 200 ""reply"" Facebook posts were collected from members of a tinnitus group and a hyperacusis group. Data were analyzed via the LIWC 2015 software program and compared to typical bloggers. As this was an explanatory mixed-methods study, we used qualitative thematic analyses to explain, interpret, and illustrate the quantitative results. Results Overall, quantitative results indicated lower overall emotional tone for all categories (tinnitus and hyperacusis, initial and reply), which was mostly influenced by higher negative emotion. Higher levels of authenticity or truth were found in the hyperacusis sample but not in the tinnitus sample. Lower levels of clout (social standing) were indicated in all groups, and a lower level of analytical thinking style (concepts and complex categories rather than narratives) was found in the hyperacusis sample. Additional analysis of the language indicated higher levels of sadness and anxiety in all groups and lower levels of anger, particularly for initial replies. These data support prior findings indicating higher levels of anxiety and depression in this patient population based on the actual words in blog posts and not from self-report questionnaires. Qualitative results identified 3 major themes from both the tinnitus and hyperacusis texts: suffering, negative emotional tone, and coping strategies. Conclusions Results from this study suggest support for the predominant clinical view that patients with tinnitus and hyperacusis have higher levels of anxiety and depression than the general population. The extent of the suffering described and patterns of coping strategies suggest clinical practice patterns and the need for research in implementing improved practice plans.","['1 Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders, College of Allied Health, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City.', '2 Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, College of Allied Health, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City.', '3 Department of Medical Imaging and Radiation Sciences, College of Allied Health, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City.']","Suzanne H Kimball, Toby Hamilton, Erin Benear, Jonathan Baldwin, ",American journal of audiology,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31430190

      This article describes an ensembling system to automatically extract adverse drug events and drug related entities from clinical narratives, which was developed for the 2018 n2c2 Shared Task Track 2. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      We designed a neural model to tackle both nested (entities embedded in other entities) and polysemous entities (entities annotated with multiple semantic types) based on MIMIC III discharge summaries. To better represent rare and unknown words in entities, we further tokenized the MIMIC III data set by splitting the words into finer-grained subwords. We finally combined all the models to boost the performance. Additionally, we implemented a featured-based conditional random field model and created an ensemble to combine its predictions with those of the neural model. Results:
      
    

    
      Our method achieved 92.78% lenient micro F1-score, with 95.99% lenient precision, and 89.79% lenient recall, respectively. Experimental results showed that combining the predictions of either multiple models, or of a single model with different settings can improve performance. Discussion:
      
    

    
      Analysis of the development set showed that our neural models can detect more informative text regions than feature-based conditional random field models. Furthermore, most entity types significantly benefit from subword representation, which also allows us to extract sparse entities, especially nested entities. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The overall results have demonstrated that the ensemble method can accurately recognize entities, including nested and polysemous entities. Additionally, our method can recognize sparse entities by reconsidering the clinical narratives at a finer-grained subword level, rather than at the word level.","['1 National Centre for Text Mining, School of Computer Science, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', '2 Artificial Intelligence Research Centre (AIRC), National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Tokyo, Japan.', '3 Toyota Technological Institute, Nagoya, Japan.']","Meizhi Ju, Nhung T H Nguyen, Makoto Miwa, Sophia Ananiadou, ",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2020,adverse drug event; electronic health record; information extraction; natural language processing; nested named entity recognition.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31197355
821,Current approaches to identify sections within clinical narratives from electronic health records: a systematic review,"Background:
      
    

    
      The identification of sections in narrative content of Electronic Health Records (EHR) has demonstrated to improve the performance of clinical extraction tasks; however, there is not yet a shared understanding of the concept and its existing methods. The objective is to report the results of a systematic review concerning approaches aimed at identifying sections in narrative content of EHR, using both automatic or semi-automatic methods. Methods:
      
    

    
      This review includes articles from the databases: SCOPUS, Web of Science and PubMed (from January 1994 to September 2018). The selection of studies was done using predefined eligibility criteria and applying the PRISMA recommendations. Search criteria were elaborated by using an iterative and collaborative keyword enrichment. Results:
      
    

    
      Following the eligibility criteria, 39 studies were selected for analysis. The section identification approaches proposed by these studies vary greatly depending on the kind of narrative, the type of section, and the application. We observed that 57% of them proposed formal methods for identifying sections and 43% adapted a previously created method. Seventy-eight percent were intended for English texts and 41% for discharge summaries. Studies that are able to identify explicit (with headings) and implicit sections correspond to 46%. Regarding the level of granularity, 54% of the studies are able to identify sections, but not subsections. From the technical point of view, the methods can be classified into rule-based methods (59%), machine learning methods (22%) and a combination of both (19%). Hybrid methods showed better results than those relying on pure machine learning approaches, but lower than rule-based methods; however, their scope was more ambitious than the latter ones. Despite all the promising performance results, very few studies reported tests under a formal setup. Almost all the studies relied on custom dictionaries; however, they used them in conjunction with a controlled terminology, most commonly the UMLSⓇ metathesaurus. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Identification of sections in EHR narratives is gaining popularity for improving clinical extraction projects.

822,A universal anti-cancer vaccine: Chimeric invariant chain potentiates the inhibition of melanoma progression and the improvement of survival,"For many years, clinicians and scientists attempt to develop methods to stimulate the immune system to target malignant cells. Recent data suggest that effective cancer vaccination requires combination immunotherapies to overcome tumor immune evasion. Through presentation of both MHC-I and II molecules, DCs-based vaccine platforms are effective in generating detectable CD4 and CD8 T cell responses against tumor-associated antigens. Several platforms include DC transfection with mRNA of the desired tumor antigen. These DCs are then delivered to the host and elicit an immune response against the antigen of interest. We have recently established an mRNA genetic platform which induced specific CD8+ cytotoxic T cell response by DC vaccination against melanoma. In our study, an MHC-II mRNA DCs vaccine platform was developed to activate CD4+ T cells and to enhance the anti-tumor response. The invariant chain (Ii) was modified and the semi-peptide CLIP was replaced with an MHC-II binding peptide sequences of melanoma antigens. These chimeric MHC-II constructs are presented by DCs and induce proliferation of tumor specific CD4+ T cells. When administered in combination with the MHC-I platform into tumor bearing mice, these constructs were able to inhibit tumor growth, and improve mouse survival. Deciphering the immunological mechanism of action, we observed an efficient CTLs killing in addition to higher levels of Th1 and Th2 subsets in the groups immunized with a combination of the MHC-I and MHC-II constructs. These universal constructs can be applied in multiple combinations and offer an attractive opportunity to improve cancer treatment.","['1 Department of Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', '2 Clinical Cooperation Unit Dermato-Oncology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', '3 Department of Dermatology, Venereology and Allergology, University Medical Center Mannheim, Ruprecht-Karl University of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany.', '4 Surgery Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.', '5 GMP and T Cell Therapy Unit, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.']","Adi Sharbi-Yunger, Mareike Grees, Gal Cafri, David Bassan, Stefan B Eichmüller, Esther Tzehoval, Jochen Utikal, Viktor Umansky, Lea Eisenbach, ",International journal of cancer,2019,MHC Class II; chimeric construct; dendritic Cells; mRNA; melanoma; vaccine.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30106470
823,Validation of an alcohol misuse classifier in hospitalized patients,"Background:
      
    

    
      Current modes of identifying alcohol misuse in hospitalized patients rely on self-report questionnaires and diagnostic codes that have limitations, including low sensitivity. Information in the clinical notes of the electronic health record (EHR) may further augment the identification of alcohol misuse. Natural language processing (NLP) with supervised machine learning has been successful at analyzing clinical notes and identifying cases of alcohol misuse in trauma patients. Methods:
      
    

    
      An alcohol misuse NLP classifier, previously developed on trauma patients who completed the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, was validated in a cohort of 1000 hospitalized patients at a large, tertiary health system between January 1, 2007 and September 1, 2017. The clinical notes were processed using the clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) guidelines for alcohol misuse were used during annotation of the medical records in our validation dataset. Results:
      
    

    
      The alcohol misuse classifier had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.91 (95% CI 0.90-0.93) in the cohort of hospitalized patients. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 0.88 (95% CI 0.85-0.90), 0.78 (95% CI 0.74-0.82), 0.85 (95% CI 0.82-0.87), and 0.82 (95% CI 0.78-0.86), respectively. The Hosmer-Lemeshow Test (p = 0.13) demonstrates good model fit. Additionally, there was a dose-dependent response in alcohol consumption behaviors across increasing strata of predicted probabilities for alcohol misuse. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The alcohol misuse NLP classifier had good discrimination and test characteristics in hospitalized patients. An approach using the clinical notes with NLP and supervised machine learning may better identify alcohol misuse cases than conventional methods solely relying on billing diagnostic codes.","['1 Stritch School of Medicine, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, IL, USA.', '2 Department of Computer Science, Loyola University Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', '3 Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences, Rush Medical College, Rush University, Chicago, IL, USA.', '4 Stritch School of Medicine, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, IL, USA; Department of Public Health Sciences, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, IL, USA; Center for Health Outcomes and Informatics Research, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, IL, USA.', '5 Department of Computer Science, Loyola University Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA; Department of Public Health Sciences, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, IL, USA; Center for Health Outcomes and Informatics Research, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, IL, USA.', '6 Stritch School of Medicine, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, IL, USA; Department of Public Health Sciences, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, IL, USA; Center for Health Outcomes and Informatics Research, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, IL, USA.

824,Social Media as an Emerging Data Resource for Epidemiologic Research: Characteristics of Regular and Nonregular Social Media Users in Nurses' Health Study II,"With advances in natural language processing and machine learning, researchers are leveraging social media as a low-cost, low-burden method for measuring various psychosocial factors. However, it is unclear whether information derived from social media is generalizable to broader populations, especially middle-aged and older adults. Using data on women aged 53-70 years from Nurses' Health Study II (2017-2018; n = 49,045), we assessed differences in sociodemographic characteristics, health conditions, behaviors, and psychosocial factors between regular and nonregular users of Facebook (Facebook, Inc., Menlo Park, California). We evaluated effect sizes with phi (φ) coefficients (categorical data) or Cohen's d (continuous data) and calculated odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. While most comparisons between regular and nonregular users achieved statistical significance in this large sample, effect sizes were mostly ""very small"" (conventionally defined as φ or d <0.01) (e.g., optimism score: meanregular users = 19 vs. meannonregular users = 19 (d = -0.03); physical activity: meanregular users = 24 metabolic equivalent of task (MET)-hours/week vs. meannonregular users = 24 MET-hours/week (d = 0.01)). Some factors had slightly larger differences for regular users versus nonregular users (e.g., depression: 28% vs. 23% (φ = 0.05); odds ratio = 1.27 (95% confidence interval: 1.22, 1.33); obesity: 34% vs. 26% (φ = 0.07); odds ratio = 1.42 (95% confidence interval: 1.36, 1.48)). Results suggest that regular Facebook users were similar to nonregular users across sociodemographic and psychosocial factors, with modestly worse health regarding obesity and depressive symptoms.

825,Natural language processing of radiology reports for identification of skeletal site-specific fractures,"Background:
      
    

    
      Osteoporosis has become an important public health issue. Most of the population, particularly elderly people, are at some degree of risk of osteoporosis-related fractures. Accurate identification and surveillance of patient populations with fractures has a significant impact on reduction of cost of care by preventing future fractures and its corresponding complications. Methods:
      
    

    
      In this study, we developed a rule-based natural language processing (NLP) algorithm for identification of twenty skeletal site-specific fractures from radiology reports. The rule-based NLP algorithm was based on regular expressions developed using MedTagger, an NLP tool of the Apache Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA) pipeline to facilitate information extraction from clinical narratives. Radiology notes were retrieved from the Mayo Clinic electronic health records data warehouse. We developed rules for identifying each fracture type according to physicians' knowledge and experience, and refined these rules via verification with physicians. This study was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) for human subject research. Results:
      
    

    
      We validated the NLP algorithm using the radiology reports of a community-based cohort at Mayo Clinic with the gold standard constructed by medical experts. The micro-averaged results of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and F1-score of the proposed NLP algorithm are 0.930, 1.0, 1.0, 0.941, 0.961, respectively. The F1-score is 1.0 for 8 fractures, and above 0.9 for a total of 17 out of 20 fractures (85%). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The results verified the effectiveness of the proposed rule-based NLP algorithm in automatic identification of osteoporosis-related skeletal site-specific fractures from radiology reports. The NLP algorithm could be utilized to accurately identify the patients with fractures and those who are also at high risk of future fractures due to osteoporosis. Appropriate care interventions to those patients, not only the most at-risk patients but also those with emerging risk, would significantly reduce future fractures.","['1 Division of Biomedical Statistics and Informatics, Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, 200 1st ST SW, Rochester, MN, USA. wang.yanshan@mayo.edu.', '2 Division of Biomedical Statistics and Informatics, Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, 200 1st ST SW, Rochester, MN, USA.', '3 Division of Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, 200 1st ST SW, MN, Rochester, USA.', '4 Division of Epidemiology, Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, 200 1st ST SW, MN, Rochester, USA.']","Yanshan Wang, Saeed Mehrabi, Sunghwan Sohn, Elizabeth J Atkinson, Shreyasee Amin, Hongfang Liu, ",BMC medical informatics and decision making,2019,Electronic health records; Fracture identification; Natural language processing; Radiology reports.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30943952
826,Towards a top-down approach for an automatic discourse analysis for Basque: Segmentation and Central Unit detection tool,"Lately, discourse structure has received considerable attention due to the benefits its application offers in several NLP tasks such as opinion mining, summarization, question answering, text simplification, among others. When automatically analyzing texts, discourse parsers typically perform two different tasks: i) identification of basic discourse units (text segmentation) ii) linking discourse units by means of discourse relations, building structures such as trees or graphs. The resulting discourse structures are, in general terms, accurate at intra-sentence discourse-level relations, however they fail to capture the correct inter-sentence relations. Detecting the main discourse unit (the Central Unit) is helpful for discourse analyzers (and also for manual annotation) in improving their results in rhetorical labeling. Bearing this in mind, we set out to build the first two steps of a discourse parser following a top-down strategy: i) to find discourse units, ii) to detect the Central Unit. The final step, i.e. assigning rhetorical relations, remains to be worked on in the immediate future. In accordance with this strategy, our paper presents a tool consisting of a discourse segmenter and an automatic Central Unit detector.","['1 Ixa Group, Language and Computer Systems, University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Bilbao, Basque Country.', '2 Ixa Group, Language and Computer Systems, University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Donostia, Basque Country.', '3 Ixa Group, Didactics of Language and Literatura, Bilboko Hezkuntza Fakultatea, University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Leioa, Basque Country.']","Aitziber Atutxa, Kepa Bengoetxea, Arantza Diaz de Ilarraza, Mikel Iruskieta, ",PloS one,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31483814
827,VHost-Classifier: virus-host classification using natural language processing,"Motivation:
      
    

    
      When analyzing viral metagenomic sequences, it is often desired to filter the results of a BLAST analysis by the host species of the virus. VHost-Classifier automates this procedure using a natural language processing algorithm written in Python 3, which takes a list of taxonomic identifiers (taxids) returned from a BLAST query using viral sequences as input. The taxid output is binned by the evolutionary lineage of their host, based on string matching the words in their English names. If VHost-Classifier cannot identify a host, it attempts to bin the sequences by the environment from which the sample originated. VHost-Classifier predicts the evolutionary lineage of the host from the virus name and does not rely on referencing taxids against a database; therefore, it is not constrained by the size of a database and can host classify newly characterized viruses. Results:
      
    

    
      Benchmarked on a test dataset of 1000 randomly selected viral taxids on the NCBI taxonomy database, VHost-Classifier assigned, with 100% accuracy, a host to the rank of Class for >93% of viruses, and to the rank of Family for >37% of viruses. Availability and implementation:

828,Moonstone: a novel natural language processing system for inferring social risk from clinical narratives,"Background:
      
    

    
      Social risk factors are important dimensions of health and are linked to access to care, quality of life, health outcomes and life expectancy. However, in the Electronic Health Record, data related to many social risk factors are primarily recorded in free-text clinical notes, rather than as more readily computable structured data, and hence cannot currently be easily incorporated into automated assessments of health. In this paper, we present Moonstone, a new, highly configurable rule-based clinical natural language processing system designed to automatically extract information that requires inferencing from clinical notes. Our initial use case for the tool is focused on the automatic extraction of social risk factor information - in this case, housing situation, living alone, and social support - from clinical notes. Nursing notes, social work notes, emergency room physician notes, primary care notes, hospital admission notes, and discharge summaries, all derived from the Veterans Health Administration, were used for algorithm development and evaluation. Results:
      
    

    
      An evaluation of Moonstone demonstrated that the system is highly accurate in extracting and classifying the three variables of interest (housing situation, living alone, and social support). The system achieved positive predictive value (i.e. precision) scores ranging from 0.66 (homeless/marginally housed) to 0.98 (lives at home/not homeless), accuracy scores ranging from 0.63 (lives in facility) to 0.95 (lives alone), and sensitivity (i.e. recall) scores ranging from 0.75 (lives in facility) to 0.97 (lives alone). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The Moonstone system is - to the best of our knowledge - the first freely available, open source natural language processing system designed to extract social risk factors from clinical text with good (lives in facility) to excellent (lives alone) performance. Although developed with the social risk factor identification task in mind, Moonstone provides a powerful tool to address a range of clinical natural language processing tasks, especially those tasks that require nuanced linguistic processing in conjunction with inference capabilities.","['1 Department of Biomedical Informatics, 421 Wakara Way, University of Utah, alt Lake City, 84108, UT, USA. mike.conway@utah.edu.', '2 San Francisco VA Medical Center, 4150 Clement Street, San Francisco, 94121, CA, USA.', '3 Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, 505 Parnassus Ave, San Francisco, 94143, CA, USA.', '4 Department of Biomedical Informatics, 421 Wakara Way, University of Utah, alt Lake City, 84108, UT, USA.', '5 Salt Lake City VA Health Care System, 500 Foothill Drive, Salt Lake City, 84148, UT, USA.']","Mike Conway, Salomeh Keyhani, Lee Christensen, Brett R South, Marzieh Vali, Louise C Walter, Danielle L Mowery, Samir Abdelrahman, Wendy W Chapman, ",Journal of biomedical semantics,2019,Natural language processing; Social determinants of health; Software.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30975223
829,Risk Assessment Tools and Data-Driven Approaches for Predicting and Preventing Suicidal Behavior,"Risk assessment of suicidal behavior is a time-consuming but notoriously inaccurate activity for mental health services globally. In the last 50 years a large number of tools have been designed for suicide risk assessment, and tested in a wide variety of populations, but studies show that these tools suffer from low positive predictive values. More recently, advances in research fields such as machine learning and natural language processing applied on large datasets have shown promising results for health care, and may enable an important shift in advancing precision medicine. In this conceptual review, we discuss established risk assessment tools and examples of novel data-driven approaches that have been used for identification of suicidal behavior and risk. We provide a perspective on the strengths and weaknesses of these applications to mental health-related data, and suggest research directions to enable improvement in clinical practice.","[""1 Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, United Kingdom."", '2 School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden.', '3 South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom.', '4 National Center for Suicide Research and Prevention (NASP), Department of Learning, Informatics, Management and Ethics (LIME), Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', '5 National Center for Suicide Research and Prevention (NASP), Centre for Health Economics, Informatics and Health Services Research (CHIS), Stockholm Health Care Services (SLSO), Stockholm, Sweden.', '6 Department of Psychiatry, IIS-Jimenez Diaz Foundation, Madrid, Spain.', '7 Department of Psychiatry, Autonoma University, Madrid, Spain.', '8 Department of Psychiatry, General Hospital of Villalba, Madrid, Spain.', '9 CIBERSAM, Carlos III Institute of Health, Madrid, Spain.', '10 Department of Psychiatry, University Hospital Rey Juan Carlos, Móstoles, Spain.', '11 Department of Psychiatry, University Hospital Infanta Elena, Valdemoro, Spain.', '12 Department of Psychiatry, Universidad Católica del Maule, Talca, Chile.', '13 Department of Computer Science, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, United Kingdom.', '14 Division of Psychiatry, University College London, London, United Kingdom.', '15 Alan Turing Institute, London, United Kingdom.', '16 School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.']","Sumithra Velupillai, Gergö Hadlaczky, Enrique Baca-Garcia, Genevieve M Gorrell, Nomi Werbeloff, Dong Nguyen, Rashmi Patel, Daniel Leightley, Johnny Downs, Matthew Hotopf, Rina Dutta, ",Frontiers in psychiatry,2019,clinical informatics; machine learning; natural language processing; suicidality; suicide risk assessment; suicide risk prediction.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30814958
830,Using distant supervision to augment manually annotated data for relation extraction,"Significant progress has been made in applying deep learning on natural language processing tasks recently. However, deep learning models typically require a large amount of annotated training data while often only small labeled datasets are available for many natural language processing tasks in biomedical literature. Building large-size datasets for deep learning is expensive since it involves considerable human effort and usually requires domain expertise in specialized fields. In this work, we consider augmenting manually annotated data with large amounts of data using distant supervision. However, data obtained by distant supervision is often noisy, we first apply some heuristics to remove some of the incorrect annotations. Then using methods inspired from transfer learning, we show that the resulting models outperform models trained on the original manually annotated sets.","['1 Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Delaware, Newark, Delaware, United States of America.', '2 Center for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, University of Delaware, Newark, Delaware, United States of America.']","Peng Su, Gang Li, Cathy Wu, K Vijay-Shanker, ",PloS one,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31361753

      Eligibility criteria are the main strategy for screening appropriate participants for clinical trials. Automatic analysis of clinical trial eligibility criteria by digital screening, leveraging natural language processing techniques, can improve recruitment efficiency and reduce the costs involved in promoting clinical research. Objective:
      
    

    
      We aimed to create a natural language processing model to automatically classify clinical trial eligibility criteria. Methods:
      
    

    
      We proposed a classifier for short text eligibility criteria based on ensemble learning, where a set of pretrained models was integrated. The pretrained models included state-of-the-art deep learning methods for training and classification, including Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), XLNet, and A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa). The classification results by the integrated models were combined as new features for training a Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) model for eligibility criteria classification. Results:
      
    

    
      Our proposed method obtained an accuracy of 0.846, a precision of 0.803, and a recall of 0.817 on a standard data set from a shared task of an international conference. The macro F1 value was 0.807, outperforming the state-of-the-art baseline methods on the shared task. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We designed a model for screening short text classification criteria for clinical trials based on multimodel ensemble learning. Through experiments, we concluded that performance was improved significantly with a model ensemble compared to a single model. The introduction of focal loss could reduce the impact of class imbalance to achieve better performance.","['1 School of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', '2 School of Computer Science, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, China.', '3 School of Business, Guangdong University of Foreign Studies, Guangzhou, China.']","Kun Zeng, Zhiwei Pan, Yibin Xu, Yingying Qu, ",JMIR medical informatics,2020,Clinical trial; Deep learning; Eligibility criteria; Ensemble learning; Text classification.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32609092
832,Developing a Physical Activity Ontology to Support the Interoperability of Physical Activity Data,"Background:
      
    

    
      Physical activity data provides important information on disease onset, progression, and treatment outcomes. Although analyzing physical activity data in conjunction with other clinical and microbiological data will lead to new insights crucial for improving human health, it has been hampered partly because of the large variations in the way the data are collected and presented. Objective:
      
    

    
      The aim of this study was to develop a Physical Activity Ontology (PACO) to support structuring and standardizing heterogeneous descriptions of physical activities. Methods:
      
    

    
      We prepared a corpus of 1140 unique sentences collected from various physical activity questionnaires and scales as well as existing standardized terminologies and ontologies. We extracted concepts relevant to physical activity from the corpus using a natural language processing toolkit called Multipurpose Text Processing Tool. The target concepts were formalized into an ontology using Protégé (version 4). Evaluation of PACO was performed to ensure logical and structural consistency as well as adherence to the best practice principles of building an ontology. A use case application of PACO was demonstrated by structuring and standardizing 36 exercise habit statements and then automatically classifying them to a defined class of either sufficiently active or insufficiently active using FaCT++, an ontology reasoner available in Protégé. Results:
      
    

    
      PACO was constructed using 268 unique concepts extracted from the questionnaires and assessment scales. PACO contains 225 classes including 9 defined classes, 20 object properties, 1 data property, and 23 instances (excluding 36 exercise statements). The maximum depth of classes is 4, and the maximum number of siblings is 38. The evaluations with ontology auditing tools confirmed that PACO is structurally and logically consistent and satisfies the majority of the best practice rules of ontology authoring. We showed in a small sample of 36 exercise habit statements that we could formally represent them using PACO concepts and object properties. The formal representation was used to infer a patient activity status category of sufficiently active or insufficiently active using the FaCT++ reasoner. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      As a first step toward standardizing and structuring heterogeneous descriptions of physical activities for integrative data analyses, PACO was constructed based on the concepts collected from physical activity questionnaires and assessment scales. PACO was evaluated to be structurally consistent and compliant to ontology authoring principles. PACO was also demonstrated to be potentially useful in standardizing heterogeneous physical activity descriptions and classifying them into clinically meaningful categories that reflect adequacy of exercise.","['1 School of Nursing, Duke University, Durham, NC, United States.', '2 Department of Radiological Science, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, United States.']","Hyeoneui Kim, Jessica Mentzer, Ricky Taira, ",Journal of medical Internet research,2019,exercise; health information interoperability; leisure activities; terminology as topic.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31012864
833,Adverse Drug Reaction Detection in Social Media by Deepm Learning Methods,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Health-related studies have been recently at the heart attention of the media. Social media, such as Twitter, has become a valuable online tool to describe the early detection of various adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Different medications have adverse effects on various cells and tissues, sometimes more than one cell population would be adversely affected. These types of side effect are occasionally associated with the direct or indirect influence of prescribed drugs but do not have general unfavorable mutagenic consequences on patients. This study aimed to demonstrate a quick and accurate method to collect and classify information based on the distribution of approved data on Twitter. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      In this classification method, we selected ""ask a patient"" dataset and combination of Twitter ""Ask a Patient"" datasets that comprised of 6,623, 26,934, and 11,623 reviews. We used deep learning methods with the word2vec to classify ADR comments posted by the users and present an architecture by HAN, FastText, and CNN. Results:
      
    

    
      Natural language processing (NLP) deep learning is able to address more advanced peculiarity in learning information compared to other types of machine learning. Moreover, the current study highlighted the advantage of incorporating various semantic features, including topics and concepts. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Our approach predicts drug safety with the accuracy of 93% (the combination of Twitter and ""Ask a Patient"" datasets) in a binary manner. Despite the apparent benefit of various conventional classifiers, deep learningbased text classification methods seem to be precise and influential tools to detect ADR.","['1 Department of Computer and Electrical Engineering, University of Kashan, Kashan, Iran.

834,"Machine learning and natural language processing methods to identify ischemic stroke, acuity and location from radiology reports","Accurate, automated extraction of clinical stroke information from unstructured text has several important applications. ICD-9/10 codes can misclassify ischemic stroke events and do not distinguish acuity or location. Expeditious, accurate data extraction could provide considerable improvement in identifying stroke in large datasets, triaging critical clinical reports, and quality improvement efforts. In this study, we developed and report a comprehensive framework studying the performance of simple and complex stroke-specific Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) methods to determine presence, location, and acuity of ischemic stroke from radiographic text. We collected 60,564 Computed Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Radiology reports from 17,864 patients from two large academic medical centers. We used standard techniques to featurize unstructured text and developed neurovascular specific word GloVe embeddings. We trained various binary classification algorithms to identify stroke presence, location, and acuity using 75% of 1,359 expert-labeled reports. We validated our methods internally on the remaining 25% of reports and externally on 500 radiology reports from an entirely separate academic institution. In our internal population, GloVe word embeddings paired with deep learning (Recurrent Neural Networks) had the best discrimination of all methods for our three tasks (AUCs of 0.96, 0.98, 0.93 respectively). Simpler NLP approaches (Bag of Words) performed best with interpretable algorithms (Logistic Regression) for identifying ischemic stroke (AUC of 0.95), MCA location (AUC 0.96), and acuity (AUC of 0.90). Similarly, GloVe and Recurrent Neural Networks (AUC 0.92, 0.89, 0.93) generalized better in our external test set than BOW and Logistic Regression for stroke presence, location and acuity, respectively (AUC 0.89, 0.86, 0.80). Our study demonstrates a comprehensive assessment of NLP techniques for unstructured radiographic text. Our findings are suggestive that NLP/ML methods can be used to discriminate stroke features from large data cohorts for both clinical and research-related investigations.","['1 Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.', '2 Boston Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.', '3 Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.', '4 Operations Research Center, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.', '5 Sloan School of Management, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.']","Charlene Jennifer Ong, Agni Orfanoudaki, Rebecca Zhang, Francois Pierre M Caprasse, Meghan Hutch, Liang Ma, Darian Fard, Oluwafemi Balogun, Matthew I Miller, Margaret Minnig, Hanife Saglam, Brenton Prescott, David M Greer, Stelios Smirnakis, Dimitris Bertsimas, ",PloS one,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32559211
835,Quantitative analysis of manual annotation of clinical text samples,"Background:
      
    

    
      Semantic interoperability of eHealth services within and across countries has been the main topic in several research projects. It is a key consideration for the European Commission to overcome the complexity of making different health information systems work together. This paper describes a study within the EU-funded project ASSESS CT, which focuses on assessing the potential of SNOMED CT as core reference terminology for semantic interoperability at European level. Objective:
      
    

    
      This paper presents a quantitative analysis of the results obtained in ASSESS CT to determine the fitness of SNOMED CT for semantic interoperability. Methods:
      
    

    
      The quantitative analysis consists of concept coverage, term coverage and inter-annotator agreement analysis of the annotation experiments related to six European languages (English, Swedish, French, Dutch, German and Finnish) and three scenarios: (i) ADOPT, where only SNOMED CT was used by the annotators; (ii) ALTERNATIVE, where a fixed set of terminologies from UMLS, excluding SNOMED CT, was used; and (iii) ABSTAIN, where any terminologies available in the current national infrastructure of the annotators' country were used. For each language and each scenario, we configured the different terminology settings of the annotation experiments. Results:
      
    

    
      There was a positive correlation between the number of concepts in each terminology setting and their concept and term coverage values. Inter-annotator agreement is low, irrespective of the terminology setting. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      No significant differences were found between the analyses for the three scenarios, but availability of SNOMED CT for the assessed language is associated with increased concept coverage. Terminology setting size and concept and term coverage correlate positively up to a limit where more concepts do not significantly impact the coverage values. The results did not confirm the hypothesis of an inverse correlation between concept coverage and IAA due to a lower amount of choices available. The overall low IAA results pose a challenge for interoperability and indicate the need for further research to assess whether consistent terminology implementation is possible across Europe, e.g., improving term coverage by adding localized versions of the selected terminologies, analysing causes of low inter-annotator agreement, and improving tooling and guidance for annotators. The much lower term coverage for the Swedish version of SNOMED CT compared to English together with the similarly high concept coverage obtained with English and Swedish SNOMED CT reflects its relevance as a hub to connect user interface terminologies and serving a variety of user needs.","['1 Institute of Medical Informatics, Statistics and Documentation, Medical University of Graz, Austria.

The reality of cancer patients rely on the diagnosis of cancer at the early stages (either in stage 1 or stage 2).

Normally, single patient records will generate a huge amount of data if the data could be manage and analyze means to solve many problems for identifying the patterns it will leads to diagnose the cancer.

      A neural architecture combining bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks and Conditional Random fields (Bi-LSTMs-CRF) was adopted to detect various medical concept-attribute pairs in an efficient way. We then compared our deep learning-based sequence labeling approach with traditional two-step systems for three different attribute detection tasks: disease-modifier, medication-signature, and lab test-value. Results:
      
    

    
      Our results show that the proposed method achieved higher accuracy than the traditional methods for all three medical concept-attribute detection tasks. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      This study demonstrates the efficacy of our sequence labeling approach using Bi-LSTM-CRFs on the attribute detection task, indicating its potential to speed up practical clinical NLP applications.","['1 The University of Texas School of Biomedical Informatics, 7000 Fannin St Suite, Houston, TX, 600, USA.', '2 College of Computer Science and Technology, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China.', '3 Departments of Health Outcomes and Policy, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.', '4 The University of Texas School of Biomedical Informatics, 7000 Fannin St Suite, Houston, TX, 600, USA.

839,p30 protein: a critical regulator of HTLV-1 viral latency and host immunity,"The extraordinarily high prevalence of HTLV-1 subtype C (HTLV-1C) in some isolated indigenous communities in Oceania and the severity of the health conditions associated with the virus impress the great need for basic and translational research to prevent and treat HTLV-1 infection. The genome of the virus's most common subtype, HTLV-1A, encodes structural, enzymatic, and regulatory proteins that contribute to viral persistence and pathogenesis. Among these is the p30 protein encoded by the doubly spliced Tax-orf II mRNA, a nuclear/nucleolar protein with both transcriptional and post-transcriptional activity. The p30 protein inhibits the productive replication cycle via nuclear retention of the mRNA that encodes for both the viral transcriptional trans-activator Tax, and the Rex proteins that regulate the transport of incompletely spliced viral mRNA to the cytoplasm. In myeloid cells, p30 inhibits the PU-1 transcription factor that regulates interferon expression and is a critical mediator of innate and adaptive immunity. Furthermore, p30 alters gene expression, cell cycle progression, and DNA damage responses in T-cells, raising the hypothesis that p30 may directly contribute to T cell transformation. By fine-tuning viral expression while also inhibiting host innate responses, p30 is likely essential for viral infection and persistence. This concept is supported by the finding that macaques, a natural host for the closely genetically related simian T-cell leukemia virus 1 (STLV-1), exposed to an HTLV-1 knockout for p30 expression by a single point mutation do not became infected unless reversion and selection of the wild type HTLV-1 genotype occurs. All together, these data suggest that inhibition of p30 may help to curb and eventually eradicate viral infection by exposing infected cells to an effective host immune response.","['1 Animal Models and Retroviral Vaccines Section, Vaccine Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', '2 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', '3 Animal Models and Retroviral Vaccines Section, Vaccine Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA. franchig@mail.nih.gov.']","Ramona Moles, Sarkis Sarkis, Veronica Galli, Maria Omsland, Damian F J Purcell, David Yurick, Georges Khoury, Cynthia A Pise-Masison, Genoveffa Franchini, ",Retrovirology,2019,ATLL; Adaptive immunity; Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma; HAM/TSP; HTLV-1; HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis; Innate immunity; Tax-orf-II; orf-II; p30.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31852501
840,Synergistic association of FOXP3+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes with CCL20 expressions with poor prognosis of primary breast cancer: A retrospective cohort study,"Studies have shown that forkhead/winged helix transcription factor P3 (FOXP3) tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are intimately associated with invasion and survival of many invasive tumors. The inflammatory chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20) and its receptor CCR6 were found to be associated with tumor prognosis in some studies. Although increases in FOXP3 TILs infiltration and CCL20 expression have been revealed in several malignancies, their correlation in human breast tumors is as yet unclear.Surgically resected samples from 156 patients with invasive breast cancer (BC) were assessed for the expression of FOXP3 and CCL20 by immunohistochemistry. Correlation between their expressions and the association with clinicopathological characteristics and patient's prognosis were studied. Forty pairs of fresh BC and their nontumor adjacent tissues (NATs) in BC were carried out by real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) to evaluate the correlation between FOXP3 and CCL20 mRNA expression.CCL20 and FOXP3 TILs mRNA expression in tumor tissue demonstrated a high correlation (rs = 0.359, P < .001) in this cohort of breast cancer patients. Both elevated CCL20 expression and FOXP3 TILs infiltration were significantly correlated with high histological grade, positive human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), high Ki67 index, and axillary lymph node metastases. Tumors with concomitant high expressions of both markers had the worst prognosis. Multivariate analysis showed that these 2 markers were independent predictors of overall survival. The patients with axillary lymph node metastases with the concomitant CCL20 high expression and increased FOXP3 TILs infiltration had the worst overall survival (OS) (P < .001), In lymph node-negative breast cancer patients, the status of CCL20 and FOXP3 was not related to OS (P = .22).The results suggest that CCL20 and FOXP3 TILs may have synergistic effects, and their upregulated expressions may lead to immune evasion in breast cancer. Combinatorial immunotherapeutic approaches aiming at blocking CCL20 and depleting FOXP3 might improve therapeutic efficacy in breast cancer patients.","['1 Department of Medical Oncology, Beijing Key Laboratory for Therapeutic Cancer Vaccines.', '2 Department of Surgical Breast Cancer, Capital Medical University Cancer Center, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', '3 Department of Surgery, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, US.']","Xia Zhao, Yanping Li, Xiaoli Wang, Jiangping Wu, Yanhua Yuan, Shuzhen Lv, Jun Ren, ",Medicine,2019 Dec,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31852159
841,Closing the Gap in Surveillance and Audit of Invasive Mold Diseases for Antifungal Stewardship Using Machine Learning,"Clinical audit of invasive mold disease (IMD) in hematology patients is inefficient due to the difficulties of case finding. This results in antifungal stewardship (AFS) programs preferentially reporting drug cost and consumption rather than measures that actually reflect quality of care. We used machine learning-based natural language processing (NLP) to non-selectively screen chest tomography (CT) reports for pulmonary IMD, verified by clinical review against international definitions and benchmarked against key AFS measures. NLP screened 3014 reports from 1 September 2008 to 31 December 2017, generating 784 positives that after review, identified 205 IMD episodes (44% probable-proven) in 185 patients from 50,303 admissions. Breakthrough-probable/proven-IMD on antifungal prophylaxis accounted for 60% of episodes with serum monitoring of voriconazole or posaconazole in the 2 weeks prior performed in only 53% and 69% of episodes, respectively. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy within 2 days of CT scan occurred in only 54% of episodes. The average turnaround of send-away bronchoalveolar galactomannan of 12 days (range 7-22) was associated with high empiric liposomal amphotericin consumption. A random audit of 10% negative reports revealed two clinically significant misses (0.9%, 2/223). This is the first successful use of applied machine learning for institutional IMD surveillance across an entire hematology population describing process and outcome measures relevant to AFS. Compared to current methods of clinical audit, semi-automated surveillance using NLP is more efficient and inclusive by avoiding restrictions based on any underlying hematologic condition, and has the added advantage of being potentially scalable.","['1 Department of Infectious Diseases, The Alfred Hospital and Central Clinical School, Monash University, Melbourne 3004, VIC, Australia.', '2 General Medical Unit, Alfred Health, Melbourne 3004, VIC, Australia.', '3 Infection and Immunity Program, Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Department of Microbiology, Monash University, Clayton 3800, VIC, Australia.', '4 Haematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Alfred Health, Melbourne 3004, VIC, Australia.', '5 Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University, Clayton 3800, VIC, Australia.', '6 Department of Infectious Diseases, The Alfred Hospital and Central Clinical School, Monash University, Melbourne 3004, VIC, Australia. michelle.ananda-rajah@monash.edu.', '7 General Medical Unit, Alfred Health, Melbourne 3004, VIC, Australia. michelle.ananda-rajah@monash.edu.']","Diva Baggio, Trisha Peel, Anton Y Peleg, Sharon Avery, Madhurima Prayaga, Michelle Foo, Gholamreza Haffari, Ming Liu, Christoph Bergmeir, Michelle Ananda-Rajah, ",Journal of clinical medicine,2019,antifungal stewardship; aspergillosis; invasive fungal diseases; machine learning; mold infections; natural language processing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31491944
842,DQueST: dynamic questionnaire for search of clinical trials,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Information overload remains a challenge for patients seeking clinical trials. We present a novel system (DQueST) that reduces information overload for trial seekers using dynamic questionnaires. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      DQueST first performs information extraction and criteria library curation. DQueST transforms criteria narratives in the ClinicalTrials.gov repository into a structured format, normalizes clinical entities using standard concepts, clusters related criteria, and stores the resulting curated library. DQueST then implements a real-time dynamic question generation algorithm. During user interaction, the initial search is similar to a standard search engine, and then DQueST performs real-time dynamic question generation to select criteria from the library 1 at a time by maximizing its relevance score that reflects its ability to rule out ineligible trials. DQueST dynamically updates the remaining trial set by removing ineligible trials based on user responses to corresponding questions. The process iterates until users decide to stop and begin manually reviewing the remaining trials. Results:
      
    

    
      In simulation experiments initiated by 10 diseases, DQueST reduced information overload by filtering out 60%-80% of initial trials after 50 questions. Reviewing the generated questions against previous answers, on average, 79.7% of the questions were relevant to the queried conditions. By examining the eligibility of random samples of trials ruled out by DQueST, we estimate the accuracy of the filtering procedure is 63.7%. In a study using 5 mock patient profiles, DQueST on average retrieved trials with a 1.465 times higher density of eligible trials than an existing search engine. In a patient-centered usability evaluation, patients found DQueST useful, easy to use, and returning relevant results. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      DQueST contributes a novel framework for transforming free-text eligibility criteria to questions and filtering out clinical trials based on user answers to questions dynamically. It promises to augment keyword-based methods to improve clinical trial search.","['1 Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.', '2 Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.']","Cong Liu, Chi Yuan, Alex M Butler, Richard D Carvajal, Ziran Ryan Li, Casey N Ta, Chunhua Weng, ",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2019,clinical trial search; common data model; eligibility criteria; interactive search; natural language processing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31390010

      We present a narrative review of recent work on the utilisation of Natural Language Processing (NLP) for the analysis of social media (including online health communities) specifically for public health applications. Methods:
      
    

    
      We conducted a literature review of NLP research that utilised social media or online consumer-generated text for public health applications, focussing on the years 2016 to 2018. Papers were identified in several ways, including PubMed searches and the inspection of recent conference proceedings from the Association of Computational Linguistics (ACL), the Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI), and the International AAAI (Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence) Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM). Popular data sources included Twitter, Reddit, various online health communities, and Facebook. Results:
      
    

    
      In the recent past, communicable diseases (e.g., influenza, dengue) have been the focus of much social media-based NLP health research. However, mental health and substance use and abuse (including the use of tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, and opioids) have been the subject of an increasing volume of research in the 2016 - 2018 period. Associated with this trend, the use of lexicon-based methods remains popular given the availability of psychologically validated lexical resources suitable for mental health and substance abuse research. Finally, we found that in the period under review ""modern"" machine learning methods (i.e. deep neural-network-based methods), while increasing in popularity, remain less widely used than ""classical"" machine learning methods.","['1 Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, United States.']","Mike Conway, Mengke Hu, Wendy W Chapman, ",Yearbook of medical informatics,2019 Aug,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31419834
844,Analyzing the Time Course of Pupillometric Data,"This article provides a tutorial for analyzing pupillometric data. Pupil dilation has become increasingly popular in psychological and psycholinguistic research as a measure to trace language processing. However, there is no general consensus about procedures to analyze the data, with most studies analyzing extracted features from the pupil dilation data instead of analyzing the pupil dilation trajectories directly. Recent studies have started to apply nonlinear regression and other methods to analyze the pupil dilation trajectories directly, utilizing all available information in the continuously measured signal. This article applies a nonlinear regression analysis, generalized additive mixed modeling, and illustrates how to analyze the full-time course of the pupil dilation signal. The regression analysis is particularly suited for analyzing pupil dilation in the fields of psychological and psycholinguistic research because generalized additive mixed models can include complex nonlinear interactions for investigating the effects of properties of stimuli (e.g., formant frequency) or participants (e.g., working memory score) on the pupil dilation signal. To account for the variation due to participants and items, nonlinear random effects can be included. However, one of the challenges for analyzing time series data is dealing with the autocorrelation in the residuals, which is rather extreme for the pupillary signal. On the basis of simulations, we explain potential causes of this extreme autocorrelation, and on the basis of the experimental data, we show how to reduce their adverse effects, allowing a much more coherent interpretation of pupillary data than possible with feature-based techniques.","['1 1 University of Groningen, The Netherlands.', '2 2 Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen, Germany.', '3 3 University of Bristol, UK.']","Jacolien van Rij, Petra Hendriks, Hedderik van Rijn, R Harald Baayen, Simon N Wood, ",Trends in hearing,Jan-Dec 2019,autocorrelation; generalized additive mixed model; preprocessing; pupillometry; statistical analysis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31081486
845,Identifying Goals of Care Conversations in the Electronic Health Record Using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning,"Context:
      
    

    
      Goals-of-care discussions are an important quality metric in palliative care. However, goals-of-care discussions are often documented as free text in diverse locations. It is difficult to identify these discussions in the electronic health record (EHR) efficiently. Objectives:
      
    

    
      To develop, train, and test an automated approach to identifying goals-of-care discussions in the EHR, using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML). Methods:
      
    

    
      From the electronic health records of an academic health system, we collected a purposive sample of 3183 EHR notes (1435 inpatient notes and 1748 outpatient notes) from 1426 patients with serious illness over 2008-2016, and manually reviewed each note for documentation of goals-of-care discussions. Separately, we developed a program to identify notes containing documentation of goals-of-care discussions using NLP and supervised ML. We estimated the performance characteristics of the NLP/ML program across 100 pairs of randomly partitioned training and test sets. We repeated these methods for inpatient-only and outpatient-only subsets. Results:
      
    

    
      Of 3183 notes, 689 contained documentation of goals-of-care discussions. The mean sensitivity of the NLP/ML program was 82.3% (SD 3.2%), and the mean specificity was 97.4% (SD 0.7%). NLP/ML results had a median positive likelihood ratio of 32.2 (IQR 27.5-39.2) and a median negative likelihood ratio of 0.18 (IQR 0.16-0.20). Performance was better in inpatient-only samples than outpatient-only samples. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Using NLP and ML techniques, we developed a novel approach to identifying goals-of-care discussions in the EHR. NLP and ML represent a potential approach toward measuring goals-of-care discussions as a research outcome and quality metric.","['1 Cambia Palliative Care Center of Excellence, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA; Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, Harborview Medical Center, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.', '2 Cambia Palliative Care Center of Excellence, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA; Department of Biostatistics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.', '3 Cambia Palliative Care Center of Excellence, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA; Department of Biobehavioral Nursing and Health Informatics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA; Department of Bioinformatics and Medical Education, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.', '4 Cambia Palliative Care Center of Excellence, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA; Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, Harborview Medical Center, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA; Department of Biobehavioral Nursing and Health Informatics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.', '5 Cambia Palliative Care Center of Excellence, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA; Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA; Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, Washington, USA.', '6 Cambia Palliative Care Center of Excellence, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA; Department of Family Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.', '7 Department of Psychosocial Oncology and Palliative Care, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', '8 Cambia Palliative Care Center of Excellence, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA; Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, Harborview Medical Center, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA; Department of Biobehavioral Nursing and Health Informatics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA; Department of Bioethics and Humanities, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.

847,Neural negated entity recognition in Spanish electronic health records,"This work deals with negation detection in the context of clinical texts. Negation detection is a key for decision support systems since negated events (detection of absence of some events) help ascertain current medical conditions. For artificial intelligence, negation detection is a valuable point as it can revert the meaning of a part of a text and, accordingly, influence other tasks such as medical dosage adjustment, the detection of adverse drug reactions or hospital acquired diseases. We focus on negated medical events such as disorders, findings and allergies. From Natural Language Processing (NLP) background, we refer to them as negated medical entities. A novelty of this work is that we approached this task as Named Entity Recognition (NER) with the restriction that just negated medical entities must be recognized (in an attempt to help distinguish them from non-negated ones). Our study is driven with Electronic Health Records (EHRs) written in Spanish. A challenge to cope with is the lexical variability (alternative medical forms, abbreviations, etc.). To this end, we employed an approach based on deep learning. Specifically, the system combines character embeddings to cope with out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to model contextual representations and it makes use of Conditional Random Fields (CRF) to classify each medical entity as either negated or not given the contextual dense representation. Moreover, we explored both embeddings created from words and embeddings created from lemmas. The best results were obtained with the lemmatized embeddings. Apparently, this approach reinforced the capability of the LSTMs to cope with the high lexical variability. The f-measure for exact-match was 65.1 and 82.4 for the partial-match.","['1 IXA Group, University of the Basque Country (UPV-EHU), ManuelLardizabal 1, 20080 Donostia, Spain.

848,Time-distanced gates in long short-term memory networks,"The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is widely used in modeling sequential observations in fields ranging from natural language processing to medical imaging. The LSTM has shown promise for interpreting computed tomography (CT) in lung screening protocols. Yet, traditional image-based LSTM models ignore interval differences, while recently proposed interval-modeled LSTM variants are limited in their ability to interpret temporal proximity. Meanwhile, clinical imaging acquisition may be irregularly sampled, and such sampling patterns may be commingled with clinical usages. In this paper, we propose the Distanced LSTM (DLSTM) by introducing time-distanced (i.e., time distance to the last scan) gates with a temporal emphasis model (TEM) targeting at lung cancer diagnosis (i.e., evaluating the malignancy of pulmonary nodules). Briefly, (1) the time distance of every scan to the last scan is modeled explicitly, (2) time-distanced input and forget gates in DLSTM are introduced across regular and irregular sampling sequences, and (3) the newer scan in serial data is emphasized by the TEM. The DLSTM algorithm is evaluated with both simulated data and real CT images (from 1794 National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) patients with longitudinal scans and 1420 clinical studied patients). Experimental results on simulated data indicate the DLSTM can capture families of temporal relationships that cannot be detected with traditional LSTM. Cross-validation on empirical CT datasets demonstrates that DLSTM achieves leading performance on both regularly and irregularly sampled data (e.g., improving LSTM from 0.6785 to 0.7085 on F1 score in NLST). In external-validation on irregularly acquired data, the benchmarks achieved 0.8350 (CNN feature) and 0.8380 (with LSTM) on AUC score, while the proposed DLSTM achieves 0.8905. In conclusion, the DLSTM approach is shown to be compatible with families of linear, quadratic, exponential, and log-exponential temporal models. The DLSTM can be readily extended with other temporal dependence interactions while hardly increasing overall model complexity.","['1 Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN 37235, USA.

These concept vectors are then used to assign labels to candidate phrases which are extracted using a syntactic chunker. Our approach scores an exact F-score of.32 and an inexact F-score of.45 on the well-known I2b2-2010 challenge corpus, outperforming the only other unsupervised concept extraction method.

850,Extraction of Geriatric Syndromes From Electronic Health Record Clinical Notes: Assessment of Statistical Natural Language Processing Methods,"Background:
      
    

    
      Geriatric syndromes in older adults are associated with adverse outcomes. However, despite being reported in clinical notes, these syndromes are often poorly captured by diagnostic codes in the structured fields of electronic health records (EHRs) or administrative records. Objective:
      
    

    
      We aim to automatically determine if a patient has any geriatric syndromes by mining the free text of associated EHR clinical notes. We assessed which statistical natural language processing (NLP) techniques are most effective. Methods:
      
    

    
      We applied conditional random fields (CRFs), a widely used machine learning algorithm, to identify each of 10 geriatric syndrome constructs in a clinical note. We assessed three sets of features and attributes for CRF operations: a base set, enhanced token, and contextual features. We trained the CRF on 3901 manually annotated notes from 85 patients, tuned the CRF on a validation set of 50 patients, and evaluated it on 50 held-out test patients. These notes were from a group of US Medicare patients over 65 years of age enrolled in a Medicare Advantage Health Maintenance Organization and cared for by a large group practice in Massachusetts. Results:
      
    

    
      A final feature set was formed through comprehensive feature ablation experiments. The final CRF model performed well at patient-level determination (macroaverage F1=0.834, microaverage F1=0.851); however, performance varied by construct. For example, at phrase-partial evaluation, the CRF model worked well on constructs such as absence of fecal control (F1=0.857) and vision impairment (F1=0.798) but poorly on malnutrition (F1=0.155), weight loss (F1=0.394), and severe urinary control issues (F1=0.532). Errors were primarily due to previously unobserved words (ie, out-of-vocabulary) and a lack of context. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      This study shows that statistical NLP can be used to identify geriatric syndromes from EHR-extracted clinical notes. This creates new opportunities to identify patients with geriatric syndromes and study their health outcomes.","['1 Center for Language and Speech Processing, Whiting School of Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, United States.', '2 Department of Computer Science, Whiting School of Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, United States.', '3 Center for Population Health IT, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, United States.', '4 Academic Institute, Atrius Health, Boston, MA, United States.', '5 Division of Health Sciences Informatics, School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, United States.']","Tao Chen, Mark Dredze, Jonathan P Weiner, Leilani Hernandez, Joe Kimura, Hadi Kharrazi, ",JMIR medical informatics,2019,clinical notes; conditional random fields; geriatrics; information extraction; natural language processing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30862607

To study the neural underpinnings of such predictive processing we asked 10 healthy adults to listen to a 1-h-long audiobook while their magnetoencephalographic (MEG) brain activity was recorded. We correlated the MEG signals with acoustic speech envelope, as well as with estimates of Bayesian word probability with and without the contextual word sequence (N-gram and Unigram, respectively), with a focus on time-lags. The MEG signals of auditory and sensorimotor cortices were strongly coupled to the speech envelope at the rates of syllables (4-8 ​Hz) and of prosody and intonation (0.5-2 ​Hz). The probability structure of word sequences, independently of the acoustical features, affected the ≤ 2-Hz signals extensively in auditory and rolandic regions, in precuneus, occipital cortices, and lateral and medial frontal regions. Fine-grained temporal progression patterns occurred across brain regions 100-1000 ​ms after word onsets. Although the acoustic effects were observed in both hemispheres, the contextual influences were statistically significantly lateralized to the left hemisphere. These results serve as a brain signature of the predictability of word sequences in listened continuous speech, confirming and extending previous results to demonstrate that deeply-learned knowledge and recent contextual information are employed dynamically and in a left-hemisphere-dominant manner in predicting the forthcoming words in natural speech.","['1 Medicum, Faculty of Medicine, P.O.

852,Parsing clinical text using the state-of-the-art deep learning based parsers: a systematic comparison,"Background:
      
    

    
      A shareable repository of clinical notes is critical for advancing natural language processing (NLP) research, and therefore a goal of many NLP researchers is to create a shareable repository of clinical notes, that has breadth (from multiple institutions) as well as depth (as much individual data as possible). Methods:
      
    

    
      We aimed to assess the degree to which individuals would be willing to contribute their health data to such a repository. A compact e-survey probed willingness to share demographic and clinical data categories. Participants were faculty, staff, and students in two geographically diverse major medical centers (Utah and New York). Such a sample could be expected to respond like a typical potential participant from the general public who is given complete and fully informed consent about the pros and cons of participating in a research study. Results:
      
    

    
      2140 respondents completed the surveys. 56% of respondents were ""somewhat/definitely willing"" to share clinical data with identifiers, while 89% of respondents were ""somewhat (17%) /definitely willing (72%)"" to share without identifiers. Results were consistent across gender, age, and education, but there were some differences by geographical region. Individuals were most reluctant (50-74%) sharing mental health, substance abuse, and domestic violence data. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We conclude that a substantial fraction of potential patient participants, once educated about risks and benefits, would be willing to donate de-identified clinical data to a shared research repository. A slight majority even would be willing to share absent de-identification, suggesting that perceptions about data misuse are not a major concern. Such a repository of clinical notes should be invaluable for clinical NLP research and advancement.","['1 School of Biomedical Informatics, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', '2 School of Biomedical Informatics, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. hua.xu@uth.tmc.edu.']","Yaoyun Zhang, Firat Tiryaki, Min Jiang, Hua Xu, ",BMC medical informatics and decision making,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30943955

      Alone, administrative data poorly identifies patients with palliative care needs. Objective:
      
    

    
      To identify patients with uncommon, yet devastating, illnesses using a combination of administrative data and natural language processing (NLP). Design/setting:
      
    

    
      Retrospective cohort study using the electronic medical records of a healthcare network totaling over 2500 hospital beds. We sought to identify patient populations with two unique disease processes associated with a poor prognosis: pneumoperitoneum and leptomeningeal metastases from breast cancer. Measurements:
      
    

    
      Patients with pneumoperitoneum or leptomeningeal metastasis from breast cancer were identified through administrative codes and NLP. Results:
      
    

    
      Administrative codes alone resulted in identification of 6438 patients with possible pneumoperitoneum and 557 patients with possible leptomeningeal metastasis. Adding NLP to this analysis reduced the number of patients to 869 with pneumoperitoneum and 187 with leptomeningeal metastasis secondary to breast cancer. Administrative codes alone yielded a 13% positive predictive value (PPV) for pneumoperitoneum and 25% PPV for leptomeningeal metastasis. The combination of administrative codes and NLP achieved a PPV of 100%. The entire process was completed within hours. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Adding NLP to the use of administrative codes allows for rapid identification of seriously ill patients with otherwise difficult to detect disease processes and eliminates costly, tedious, and time-intensive manual chart review. This method enables studies to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment, including palliative interventions, for unique populations of seriously ill patients who cannot be identified by administrative codes alone.","['1 1 Department of Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', '2 2 Department of Psychosocial Oncology and Palliative Care, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', '3 3 Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston, Massachusetts.', ""4 4 Department of Emergency Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts."", '5 5 Division of Neurology, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', '6 6 Division of Palliative Care, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', ""7 7 Division of Palliative Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.""]","Brooks Udelsman, Isabel Chien, Kei Ouchi, Kate Brizzi, James A Tulsky, Charlotta Lindvall, ",Journal of palliative medicine,2019 Feb,critical illness; natural language processing; patient identification.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30251922
854,PD-1 Expression during Acute Infection Is Repressed through an LSD1-Blimp-1 Axis,"During prolonged exposure to Ags, such as chronic viral infections, sustained TCR signaling can result in T cell exhaustion mediated in part by expression of programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) encoded by the Pdcd1 gene. In this study, dynamic changes in histone H3K4 modifications at the Pdcd1 locus during ex vivo and in vivo activation of CD8 T cells suggested a potential role for the histone H3 lysine 4 demethylase LSD1 in regulating PD-1 expression. CD8 T cells lacking LSD1 expressed higher levels of Pdcd1 mRNA following ex vivo stimulation as well as increased surface levels of PD-1 during acute, but not chronic, infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). Blimp-1, a known repressor of PD-1, recruited LSD1 to the Pdcd1 gene during acute, but not chronic, LCMV infection. Loss of DNA methylation at Pdcd1's promoter-proximal regulatory regions is highly correlated with its expression. However, following acute LCMV infection, in which PD-1 expression levels return to near baseline, LSD1-deficient CD8 T cells failed to remethylate the Pdcd1 locus to the levels of wild-type cells. Finally, in a murine melanoma model, the frequency of PD-1-expressing tumor-infiltrating LSD1-deficient CD8 T cells was greater than in wild type. Thus, LSD1 is recruited to the Pdcd1 locus by Blimp-1, downregulates PD-1 expression by facilitating the removal of activating histone marks, and is important for remethylation of the locus. Together, these data provide insight into the complex regulatory mechanisms governing T cell immunity and regulation of a critical T cell checkpoint gene.","['1 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322; and.', '2 Emory Vaccine Center, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322.', '3 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322; and jmboss@emory.edu.', '4 Emory Vaccine Center, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322 jmboss@emory.edu.']","Alexander P R Bally, Dennis K Neeld, Peiyuan Lu, Parimal Majumder, Yan Tang, Benjamin G Barwick, Qing Wang, Jeremy M Boss, ","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31811020

      Incidental detection of thyroid nodules on nonthyroid imaging may contribute to increased diagnosis of thyroid cancer. We investigated the prevalence of thyroid incidentalomas across imaging modalities among a predominately male veteran population. Methods:
      
    

    
      Thyroid nodules were identified on nonthyroid-directed radiology reports using natural language processing. All reports from 1995 to 2016 for chest computed tomography (CT), carotid ultrasound (US), and neck magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were reviewed. Individuals with multiple studies were included at their initial study and duplicates removed. Results:
      
    

    
      A total of 25 763 carotid US, 23 526 chest CTs with contrast, 39 262 noncontrast chest CTs, and 9503 MRIs were reviewed. With duplicates removed, 14 642 carotid US, 12 923 chest CTs with contrast, 17 416 noncontrast chest CTs, and 6926 MRIs were included. Mean age was 66.2 years and 1834 were female (3.53%). Thyroid nodules were reported on 0.84% carotid US, 3.45% MRIs, 5.84% chest CTs with contrast, and 5.14% noncontrast chest CTs. Women had a higher rate of thyroid nodules on MRI (6.46% vs 3.20%, P = .003), chest CT with contrast (9.80% vs 5.72%, P = .007), and noncontrast chest CT (8.77% vs 5.02%, P = .002), but not on carotid US (1.99% vs 0.81%, P = .12). Incidentaloma prevalence increased with age on MRI, chest CT with or without contrast, but not on carotid US, and were more commonly reported from 2007 to 2016 compared to before 2007 across all modalities. Conclusions:

The rate of reported incidental thyroid nodules is increasing, likely contributing to the increase in thyroid cancer.","['1 Department of Medicine, Minneapolis VA Health Care System, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', '2 Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', '3 Research Service, Minneapolis VA Health Care System, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', '4 Department of Pharmacy, Minneapolis VA Health Care System, Minneapolis, Minnesota.']","Tyler Drake, Amy Gravely, Anders Westanmo, Charles Billington, ",Journal of the Endocrine Society,2019,incidentalomas; natural language processing; overdiagnosis; thyroid cancer; thyroid nodules.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31993553
856,Recurrent neural networks with segment attention and entity description for relation extraction from clinical texts,"At present, great progress has been achieved on the relation extraction for clinical texts, but we have noticed that the current models have great drawbacks when dealing with long sentences and multiple entities in a sentence. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network architecture based on Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks for relation classification. Firstly, we utilize a concat-attention mechanism for capturing the most important context words for relation extraction in a sentence. In addition, a segment attention mechanism is proposed to improve the performance of the model processing long sentences. Finally, a tensor-based entity description is used to overcome the performance degradation of the model when there are multiple entities in a sentence. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated on a part of the i2b2-2010 shared task clinical relation extraction dataset. The result indicates that our model can effectively overcome the above two problems and improve the F1-score by approximately 3% compared with baseline model.","['1 College of Electronics and Information Engineering, University of Sichuan, 10065, China; Key Laboratory of Wireless Power Transmission of Ministry of Education, University of Sichuan, 610065, China.', '2 College of Electronics and Information Engineering, University of Sichuan, 10065, China.', '3 Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Key Laboratory of Obstetric and Gynecologic and Pediatric Diseases and Birth Defects of Ministry of Education, West China Second Hospital, University of Sichuan, 610041, China.

857,A study of deep learning methods for de-identification of clinical notes in cross-institute settings,"Background:
      
    

    
      De-identification is a critical technology to facilitate the use of unstructured clinical text while protecting patient privacy and confidentiality. The clinical natural language processing (NLP) community has invested great efforts in developing methods and corpora for de-identification of clinical notes. These annotated corpora are valuable resources for developing automated systems to de-identify clinical text at local hospitals. However, existing studies often utilized training and test data collected from the same institution. There are few studies to explore automated de-identification under cross-institute settings. The goal of this study is to examine deep learning-based de-identification methods at a cross-institute setting, identify the bottlenecks, and provide potential solutions. Methods:
      
    

    
      We created a de-identification corpus using a total 500 clinical notes from the University of Florida (UF) Health, developed deep learning-based de-identification models using 2014 i2b2/UTHealth corpus, and evaluated the performance using UF corpus. We compared five different word embeddings trained from the general English text, clinical text, and biomedical literature, explored lexical and linguistic features, and compared two strategies to customize the deep learning models using UF notes and resources. Results:
      
    

    
      Pre-trained word embeddings using a general English corpus achieved better performance than embeddings from de-identified clinical text and biomedical literature. The performance of deep learning models trained using only i2b2 corpus significantly dropped (strict and relax F1 scores dropped from 0.9547 and 0.9646 to 0.8568 and 0.8958) when applied to another corpus annotated at UF Health. Linguistic features could further improve the performance of de-identification in cross-institute settings. After customizing the models using UF notes and resource, the best model achieved the strict and relaxed F1 scores of 0.9288 and 0.9584, respectively. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      It is necessary to customize de-identification models using local clinical text and other resources when applied in cross-institute settings. Fine-tuning is a potential solution to re-use pre-trained parameters and reduce the training time to customize deep learning-based de-identification models trained using clinical corpus from a different institution.","['1 Department of Health Outcomes and Biomedical Informatics, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Clinical and Translational Research Building 2004 Mowry Road, PO Box 100177, Gainesville, Florida, USA.', '2 Department of Health Outcomes and Biomedical Informatics, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Clinical and Translational Research Building 2004 Mowry Road, PO Box 100177, Gainesville, Florida, USA. yonghui.wu@ufl.edu.']","Xi Yang, Tianchen Lyu, Qian Li, Chih-Yin Lee, Jiang Bian, William R Hogan, Yonghui Wu, ",BMC medical informatics and decision making,2019,Cross institutions; De-identification; Deep learning; EHR; Protected health information.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31801524

In this article, we describe the development of an automated misspelling detection and correction system for radiology and ultrasound's free texts in the Persian language. To achieve our goal, we used n-gram language model and three different types of free texts related to abdominal and pelvic ultrasound, head and neck ultrasound, and breast ultrasound reports. Our system achieved the detection performance of up to 90.29% for radiology and ultrasound's free texts with the correction accuracy of 88.56%.

The system also achieved significant savings during the documentation process and final approval of the reports in the imaging department.","['1 Department of Health Information Technology, School of Management and Information Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', '2 Health Human Resources Research Center, School of Management and Information Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', '3 Department of Health Information Management, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Tehran University of Medical Sciences(TUMS), Tehran, Iran.', '4 Advanced Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology Research Center (ADIR), Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS), Tehran, Iran.', '5 Medical Imaging Center, Cancer Research Institute, Imam Khomeini Hospital, Tehran, Iran.', '6 Breast Cancer Research Center, Cancer Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS), Tehran, Iran.', '7 Human Resource Department, Imam Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS), Tehran, Iran.', '8 Cancer Research Center, Cancer Institute of Iran, Tehran University of Medical Sciences(TUMS), Tehran, Iran. aznahvi@yahoo.com.']","Azita Yazdani, Marjan Ghazisaeedi, Nasrin Ahmadinejad, Masoumeh Giti, Habibe Amjadi, Azin Nahvijou, ",Journal of digital imaging,2020 Jun,N-gram language model; Natural language processing; Radiology reporting; Spelling correction; Ultrasound.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31823185
859,Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) for the analysis of team communication,"Communication in teams plays a vital role in team success. This work proposes Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) as a formalized, team communication methodology for the analysis of content and flow, simultaneously, of naturalistic team communication in a structured environment. Several methods of analysis of team communication exist. Few of them, however, analyze the flow and content of communication simultaneously, and none with teams using naturalistic language. Team communication data is coded for flow and content (through speech acts), then turned into FCMs for visual and statistical analysis. Results show that when using the FCM methodology both flow and content of communication can be diagrammed at the individual level, however, when assessing at the team level, what is illustrated is the flow of content. The application of different statistical analyses to the FCM output provides the opportunity to answer various questions on team communication. This study demonstrates that by using speech acts (SAs) as nodes, FCMs can illustrate and analyze team communication flow and content for naturalistic language. The FCM methodology is a powerful tool for studying team communication, and further incremental work could advance knowledge in team communication dynamics and provide contributions to graph theory. This method provides a visual overview of team communication dynamics in a naturalistic language setting, thus allowing for the study of intra-team dynamics and inter-team dynamics simultaneously.","['1 University of Rhode Island, USA.', '2 University of Missouri, USA.', '3 University of Rhode Island, USA.

860,Immunotherapy for the treatment of canine transmissible venereal tumor based in dendritic cells pulsed with tumoral exosomes,"Context: Exosomes secreted by tumor cells are a good source of cellular components that stimulate the immune response, such as alarmins (mRNA, tetraspanins (CD9, CD63, CD81), heat-shock proteins, major histocompatibility complex class I molecules) and tumor-associated antigens. These properties permit to pulsed dendritic cells in the immunotherapy for many cancers types. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the use of exosomes derived from canine transmissible venereal tumor (CTVT) as an antigen to pulsed dendritic cells and its administration in dogs with CTVT as treatment against this disease. Material and methods: From primary culture of CTVT cells the exosomes were isolated and characterized by scanning electron microscopy assay, dot blot and protein quantification. The monocytes of each patient were differentiated to dendritic cells (DC) and pulsed with CTVT exosomes (CTVTE). Phagocytosis, tumor size, populations of lymphocytes and IFN-c levels were evaluated. Results: The CTVTE showed a size around 90 nm. CD81, CD63, CD9 and Hsp70 were expressed. Monocytes showed an expression of 85.71% for CD14+, 12.3% for CD80+, 0.1% for CD83+ and 0.8% for DLA-II. In DC 5.1% for CD14+, 86.7% for CD80+, 90.1% for CD83+ and 92.6% for DLA-II and a phagocytosis of 63% was obtained by FITC Dextran test. No side effects were observed in the experimental groups with our therapy. Tumor regression was of 100% at the seventh week, as well as an increase in the level of IFN-γ (142 pg/ml), and CD4+ (28%) and CD8+ (34%) cell percentage. Discusion and conclusion: These results have shown that DC pulsed with tumor exosomes induce regression of the TVT in dogs.","['1 a Virology and Immunology Laboratory, Biological Science Faculty , Autonomous University of Nuevo León (UANL) , San Nicolás de los Garza , NL , México.', '2 b Veterinary and Zootechnics Faculty , Autonomous University of Nuevo León (UANL) , Cd Gral Escobedo , NL , México.']","Yareellys Ramos-Zayas, Moisés Armides Franco-Molina, Alex Jesús Hernádez-Granados, Diana Ginette Zárate-Triviño, Erika Evangelina Coronado-Cerda, Edgar Mendoza-Gamboa, Pablo Zapata-Benavides, Rafael Ramírez-Romero, Silvia Elena Santana-Krymskaya, Reyes Tamez-Guerra, Cristina Rodríguez-Padilla, ",Immunopharmacology and immunotoxicology,2019 Feb,Canine transmissible venereal tumor; dendritic cells; immunotherapy; tumor exosomes.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30334465
861,Associative word learning in infancy: A meta-analysis of the switch task,"Associative word learning, the ability to pair a concept to a word, is an essential mechanism for early language development. One common method by which researchers measure this ability is the Switch task (Werker, Cohen, Lloyd, Casasola, & Stager, 1998), wherein infants are habituated to 2 word-object pairings and then tested on their ability to notice a switch in those pairings. In this comprehensive meta-analysis, we summarized 141 Switch task studies involving 2,723 infants of 12 to 20 months to estimate an average effect size for the task (random-effect model) and to explore how key experimental factors affect infants' performance (fixed-effect model). The average effect size was low to moderate in size, Cohen's d = 0.32. The use of language-typical and dissimilar-sounding words as well as the presence of additional facilitative cues aided performance, particularly for younger infants. Infants learning 2 languages at home outperformed those learning 1, indicating a bilingual advantage in learning word-object associations. Together, these findings support the Processing Rich Information from Multidimensional Interactive Representations (PRIMIR) theoretical framework of infant speech perception and word learning (e.g., Werker & Curtin, 2005), but invite further theoretical work to account for the observed bilingual advantage. Lastly, some of our analyses raised the possibility of questionable research practices in this literature. Therefore, we conclude with suggestions (e.g., preregistration, transparent data peeking, and alternate statistical approaches) for how to address this important issue.

      Free-text sigs were extracted from all outpatient prescriptions generated by the computerized prescriber order entry system of a major academic institution during a 5-year period. Natural language processing was used to identify drug indications. The data set was analyzed to determine the rates at which prescribers included indications. It was stratified by provider specialty, drug class, and specific medications, to determine how often these indications were in prescriptions for as-needed (PRN) versus non-PRN medications. Results:

Although internal medicine prescribers generated the highest number of medication orders, they included indications in only 6.26% of their prescriptions, whereas orthopedic surgery providers had the highest rate of documenting indications (33.41%). Pain was the most common indication, accounting for 30.35% of all documented indications. The drug class with the highest number of sigs-containing indications was narcotic analgesics. Non-PRN chronic medication prescriptions rarely included the indication. Conclusion:

864,Natural Language Processing for Automated Quantification of Brain Metastases Reported in Free-Text Radiology Reports,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      Although the bulk of patient-generated health data are increasing exponentially, their use is impeded because most data come in unstructured format, namely as free-text clinical reports. A variety of natural language processing (NLP) methods have emerged to automate the processing of free text ranging from statistical to deep learning-based models; however, the optimal approach for medical text analysis remains to be determined. The aim of this study was to provide a head-to-head comparison of novel NLP techniques and inform future studies about their utility for automated medical text analysis. Patients and methods:
      
    

    
      Magnetic resonance imaging reports of patients with brain metastases treated in two tertiary centers were retrieved and manually annotated using a binary classification (single metastasis v two or more metastases). Multiple bag-of-words and sequence-based NLP models were developed and compared after randomly splitting the annotated reports into training and test sets in an 80:20 ratio. Results:
      
    

    
      A total of 1,479 radiology reports of patients diagnosed with brain metastases were retrieved. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model demonstrated the best overall performance on the hold-out test set with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.89 to 0.94), accuracy of 83% (95% CI, 80% to 87%), calibration intercept of -0.06 (95% CI, -0.14 to 0.01), and calibration slope of 1.06 (95% CI, 0.95 to 1.17). Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Among various NLP techniques, the bag-of-words approach combined with a LASSO regression model demonstrated the best overall performance in extracting binary outcomes from free-text clinical reports.

865,Blood-derived dendritic cell vaccinations induce immune responses that correlate with clinical outcome in patients with chemo-naive castration-resistant prostate cancer,"Background:
      
    

    
      Clinical benefit of cellular immunotherapy has been shown in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). We investigated the immunological response and clinical outcome of vaccination with blood-derived CD1c+ myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs; cDC2) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs). Methods:
      
    

    
      In this randomized phase IIa trial, 21 chemo-naive CRPC patients received maximally 9 vaccinations with mature mDCs, pDCs or a combination of mDCs plus pDCs. DCs were stimulated with protamine/mRNA and loaded with tumor-associated antigens NY-ESO-1, MAGE-C2 and MUC1. Primary endpoint was the immunological response after DC vaccination, which was monitored in peripheral blood and in T cell cultures of biopsies of post-treatment delayed-type hypersensitivity-skin tests. Main secondary endpoints were safety, feasibility, radiological PFS (rPFS) and overall survival. Radiological responses were assessed by MRIs and contrast-enhanced 68Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen PET/CT, according to RECIST 1.1, PCWG2 criteria and immune-related response criteria. Results:
      
    

    
      Both tetramer/dextramer-positive (dm+) and IFN-γ-producing (IFN-γ+) antigen specific T cells were detected more frequently in skin biopsies of patients with radiological non-progressive disease (5/13 patients; 38%) compared to patients with progressive disease (0/8 patients; 0%). In these patients with vaccination enhanced dm+ and IFN-γ+ antigen-specific T cells median rPFS was 18.8 months (n = 5) vs. 5.1 months (n = 16) in patients without IFN-γ-producing antigen-specific T cells (p = 0.02). The overall median rPFS was 9.5 months. All DC vaccines were well tolerated with grade 1-2 toxicity. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Immunotherapy with blood-derived DC subsets was feasible and safe and induced functional antigen-specific T cells. The presence of functional antigen-specific T cells correlated with an improved clinical outcome. Trial registration:

866,PheMap: a multi-resource knowledge base for high-throughput phenotyping within electronic health records,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Developing algorithms to extract phenotypes from electronic health records (EHRs) can be challenging and time-consuming. We developed PheMap, a high-throughput phenotyping approach that leverages multiple independent, online resources to streamline the phenotyping process within EHRs. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      PheMap is a knowledge base of medical concepts with quantified relationships to phenotypes that have been extracted by natural language processing from publicly available resources. PheMap searches EHRs for each phenotype's quantified concepts and uses them to calculate an individual's probability of having this phenotype. We compared PheMap to clinician-validated phenotyping algorithms from the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), dementia, and hypothyroidism using 84 821 individuals from Vanderbilt Univeresity Medical Center's BioVU DNA Biobank. We implemented PheMap-based phenotypes for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for T2DM, dementia, and hypothyroidism, and phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) for variants in FTO, HLA-DRB1, and TCF7L2. Results:
      
    

    
      In this initial iteration, the PheMap knowledge base contains quantified concepts for 841 disease phenotypes. For T2DM, dementia, and hypothyroidism, the accuracy of the PheMap phenotypes were >97% using a 50% threshold and eMERGE case-control status as a reference standard. In the GWAS analyses, PheMap-derived phenotype probabilities replicated 43 of 51 previously reported disease-associated variants for the 3 phenotypes. For 9 of the 11 top associations, PheMap provided an equivalent or more significant P value than eMERGE-based phenotypes. The PheMap-based PheWAS showed comparable or better performance to a traditional phecode-based PheWAS. PheMap is publicly available online. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      PheMap significantly streamlines the process of extracting research-quality phenotype information from EHRs, with comparable or better performance to current phenotyping approaches.","['1 Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', '2 Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', '3 Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', '4 Vanderbilt Genetics Institute, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', '5 Department of Pharmacology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.']","Neil S Zheng, QiPing Feng, V Eric Kerchberger, Juan Zhao, Todd L Edwards, Nancy J Cox, C Michael Stein, Dan M Roden, Joshua C Denny, Wei-Qi Wei, ",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2020,electronic health records; high-throughput phenotyping; natural language processing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32974638

They argue about the need for making translations available in other languages and centralized access to regional databases and that one should not disregard citations in other languages. This fact could not be any more real in the current situation regarding the novel coronavirus. When considering treatment, diagnosis and prevention, around 44% of the articles in PubMed were written in Chinese. This prompts the urgent need for quality automatic translation to make such extremely valuable information available to medical personnel in as many languages as possible. We also point out that the community should also make efforts to guarantee editorial quality and to follow the best practices in editing and publishing.

868,Health Information Technology Trends in Social Media: Using Twitter Data,"Objectives:
      
    

    
      This study analyzed the health technology trends and sentiments of users using Twitter data in an attempt to examine the public's opinions and identify their needs. Methods:
      
    

    
      Twitter data related to health technology, from January 2010 to October 2016, were collected. An ontology related to health technology was developed. Frequently occurring keywords were analyzed and visualized with the word cloud technique. The keywords were then reclassified and analyzed using the developed ontology and sentiment dictionary. Python and the R program were used for crawling, natural language processing, and sentiment analysis. Results:
      
    

    
      In the developed ontology, the keywords are divided into 'health technology' and 'health information'. Under health technology, there are are six subcategories, namely, health technology, wearable technology, biotechnology, mobile health, medical technology, and telemedicine. Under health information, there are four subcategories, namely, health information, privacy, clinical informatics, and consumer health informatics. The number of tweets about health technology has consistently increased since 2010; the number of posts in 2014 was double that in 2010, which was about 150 thousand posts. Posts about mHealth accounted for the majority, and the dominant words were 'care', 'new', 'mental', and 'fitness'. Sentiment analysis by subcategory showed that most of the posts in nearly all subcategories had a positive tone with a positive score. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Interests in mHealth have risen recently, and consequently, posts about mHealth were the most frequent.

869,Artificial Intelligence-Based Traditional Chinese Medicine Assistive Diagnostic System: Validation Study,"Background:
      
    

    
      Artificial intelligence-based assistive diagnostic systems imitate the deductive reasoning process of a human physician in biomedical disease diagnosis and treatment decision making. While impressive progress in this area has been reported, most of the reported successes are applications of artificial intelligence in Western medicine. The application of artificial intelligence in traditional Chinese medicine has lagged mainly because traditional Chinese medicine practitioners need to perform syndrome differentiation as well as biomedical disease diagnosis before a treatment decision can be made. Syndrome, a concept unique to traditional Chinese medicine, is an abstraction of a variety of signs and symptoms. The fact that the relationship between diseases and syndromes is not one-to-one but rather many-to-many makes it very challenging for a machine to perform syndrome predictions. So far, only a handful of artificial intelligence-based assistive traditional Chinese medicine diagnostic models have been reported, and they are limited in application to a single disease-type. Objective:
      
    

    
      The objective was to develop an artificial intelligence-based assistive diagnostic system capable of diagnosing multiple types of diseases that are common in traditional Chinese medicine, given a patient's electronic health record notes. The system was designed to simultaneously diagnose the disease and produce a list of corresponding syndromes. Methods:
      
    

    
      Unstructured freestyle electronic health record notes were processed by natural language processing techniques to extract clinical information such as signs and symptoms which were represented by named entities. Natural language processing used a recurrent neural network model called bidirectional long short-term memory network-conditional random forest. A convolutional neural network was then used to predict the disease-type out of 187 diseases in traditional Chinese medicine. A novel traditional Chinese medicine syndrome prediction method-an integrated learning model-was used to produce a corresponding list of probable syndromes. By following a majority-rule voting method, the integrated learning model for syndrome prediction can take advantage of four existing prediction methods (back propagation, random forest, extreme gradient boosting, and support vector classifier) while avoiding their respective weaknesses which resulted in a consistently high prediction accuracy. Results:
      
    

    
      A data set consisting of 22,984 electronic health records from Guanganmen Hospital of the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences that were collected between January 1, 2017 and September 7, 2018 was used. The data set contained a total of 187 diseases that are commonly diagnosed in traditional Chinese medicine. The diagnostic system was designed to be able to detect any one of the 187 disease-types. The data set was partitioned into a training set, a validation set, and a testing set in a ratio of 8:1:1. Test results suggested that the proposed system had a good diagnostic accuracy and a strong capability for generalization. The disease-type prediction accuracies of the top one, top three, and top five were 80.5%, 91.6%, and 94.2%, respectively. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The main contributions of the artificial intelligence-based traditional Chinese medicine assistive diagnostic system proposed in this paper are that 187 commonly known traditional Chinese medicine diseases can be diagnosed and a novel prediction method called an integrated learning model is demonstrated. This new prediction method outperformed all four existing methods in our preliminary experimental results. With further improvement of the algorithms and the availability of additional electronic health record data, it is expected that a wider range of traditional Chinese medicine disease-types could be diagnosed and that better diagnostic accuracies could be achieved.","['1 Computer Center, Guanganmen Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', '2 Certification Center of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Physician Qualification, State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.', '3 Department of Software Engineering, NCT Lab Corp, Billerica, MA, United States.']","Hong Zhang, Wandong Ni, Jing Li, Jiajun Zhang, ",JMIR medical informatics,2020,AI; BiLSTM-CRF; CNN; ML; NLP; TCM; artificial intelligence; assistive diagnostic system; convolutional neural network; disease diagnosis; machine learning; natural language processing; syndrome differentiation; syndrome prediction; traditional Chinese medicine.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32538797
870,Incorporating dictionaries into deep neural networks for the Chinese clinical named entity recognition,"Clinical named entity recognition aims to identify and classify clinical terms such as diseases, symptoms, treatments, exams, and body parts in electronic health records, which is a fundamental and crucial task for clinical and translational research. In recent years, deep neural networks have achieved significant success in named entity recognition and many other natural language processing tasks. Most of these algorithms are trained end to end, and can automatically learn features from large scale labeled datasets. However, these data-driven methods typically lack the capability of processing rare or unseen entities. Previous statistical methods and feature engineering practice have demonstrated that human knowledge can provide valuable information for handling rare and unseen cases. In this paper, we propose a new model which combines data-driven deep learning approaches and knowledge-driven dictionary approaches. Specifically, we incorporate dictionaries into deep neural networks. In addition, two different architectures that extend the bi-directional long short-term memory neural network and five different feature representation schemes are also proposed to handle the task. Computational results on the CCKS-2017 Task 2 benchmark dataset show that the proposed method achieves the highly competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-art deep learning methods.","['1 School of Information Science and Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China.', '2 School of Information Science and Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China.

Our exemplary use cases are nephrology and mammography. The software was first developed in the nephrology domain and then adapted to the mammography use case. We report on these case studies, illustrating how the application can be used by a clinician and which questions can be answered. We show that our architecture and the employed software modules are suitable for both areas of application with a limited amount of adaptations. For example, in nephrology we try to answer questions about the temporal characteristics of event sequences to gain significant insight from the data for cohort selection. We present a versatile time-line tool that enables the user to explore relations between a multitude of diagnosis and laboratory values.","['1 German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence, DFKI, 66123 Saarbrücken, Germany.

872,Association Between HIV-Related Tweets and HIV Incidence in the United States: Infodemiology Study,"Background:
      
    

    
      Adolescents and young adults in the age range of 13-24 years are at the highest risk of developing HIV infections. As social media platforms are extremely popular among youths, researchers can utilize these platforms to curb the HIV epidemic by investigating the associations between the discourses on HIV infections and the epidemiological data of HIV infections. Objective:
      
    

    
      The goal of this study was to examine how Twitter activity among young men is related to the incidence of HIV infection in the population. Methods:
      
    

    
      We used integrated human-computer techniques to characterize the HIV-related tweets by male adolescents and young male adults (age range: 13-24 years). We identified tweets related to HIV risk and prevention by using natural language processing (NLP). Our NLP algorithm identified 89.1% (2243/2517) relevant tweets, which were manually coded by expert coders. We coded 1577 HIV-prevention tweets and 17.5% (940/5372) of general sex-related tweets (including emojis, gifs, and images), and we achieved reliability with intraclass correlation at 0.80 or higher on key constructs. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the spatial patterns in posting HIV-related tweets as well as the relationships between the tweets and local HIV infection rates. Results:
      
    

    
      We analyzed 2517 tweets that were identified as relevant to HIV risk and prevention tags; these tweets were geolocated in 109 counties throughout the United States. After adjusting for region, HIV prevalence, and social disadvantage index, our findings indicated that every 100-tweet increase in HIV-specific tweets per capita from noninstitutional accounts was associated with a multiplicative effect of 0.97 (95% CI [0.94-1.00]; P=.04) on the incidence of HIV infections in the following year in a given county. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Twitter may serve as a proxy of public behavior related to HIV infections, and the association between the number of HIV-related tweets and HIV infection rates further supports the use of social media for HIV disease prevention.","['1 Department of Family and Community Health, University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing, Philadelphia, PA, United States.', '2 University of California Merced, Merced, CA, United States.', '3 University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.', ""4 Children's Hospital of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.""]","Robin Stevens, Stephen Bonett, Jacqueline Bannon, Deepti Chittamuru, Barry Slaff, Safa K Browne, Sarah Huang, José A Bauermeister, ",Journal of medical Internet research,2020,HIV/AIDS; natural language processing; social media; surveillance; youth.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32579119
873,Measuring the effect of different types of unsupervised word representations on Medical Named Entity Recognition,"Background:
      
    

    
      This work deals with Natural Language Processing applied to the clinical domain. Specifically, the work deals with a Medical Entity Recognition (MER) on Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Developing a MER system entailed heavy data preprocessing and feature engineering until Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) emerged. However, the quality of the word representations in terms of embedded layers is still an important issue for the inference of the DNNs. Goal:
      
    

    
      The main goal of this work is to develop a robust MER system adapting general-purpose DNNs to cope with the high lexical variability shown in EHRs. In addition, given that EHRs tend to be scarce when there are out-domain corpora available, the aim is to assess the impact of the word representations on the performance of the MER as we move to other domains. In this line, exhaustive experimentation varying information generation methods and network parameters are crucial. Methods:
      
    

    
      We adapted a general purpose sequential tagger based on Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory cells and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) in order to make it tolerant to high lexical variability and a limited amount of corpora. To this end, we incorporated part of speech (POS) and semantic-tag embedding layers to the word representations. Results:
      
    

    
      One of the strengths of this work is the exhaustive evaluation of dense word representations obtained varying not only the domain and genre but also the learning algorithms and their parameter settings. With the proposed method, we attained an error reduction of 1.71 (5.7%) compared to the state-of-the-art even that no preprocessing or feature engineering was used. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our results indicate that dense representations built taking word order into account leverage the entity extraction system. Besides, we found that using a medical corpus (not necessarily EHRs) to infer the representations improves the performance, even if it does not correspond to the same genre.","['1 IXA Group, University of the Basque Country (UPV-EHU), Manuel Lardizabal 1, 20080 Donostia, Spain.

874,Maximizing the use of social and behavioural information from secondary care mental health electronic health records,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      The contribution of social and behavioural factors in the development of mental health conditions and treatment effectiveness is widely supported, yet there are weak population level data sources on social and behavioural determinants of mental health. Enriching these data gaps will be crucial to accelerating precision medicine. Some have suggested the broader use of electronic health records (EHR) as a source of non-clinical determinants, although social and behavioural information are not systematically collected metrics in EHRs, internationally. Objective:
      
    

    
      In this commentary, we highlight the nature and quality of key available structured and unstructured social and behavioural data using a case example of value counts from secondary mental health data available in the UK from the UK Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) database; highlight the methodological challenges in the use of such data; and possible solutions and opportunities involving the use of natural language processing (NLP) of unstructured EHR text. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Most structured non-clinical data fields within secondary care mental health EHR data have too much missing data for adequate use. The utility of other non-clinical fields reported semi-consistently (e.g., ethnicity and marital status) is entirely dependent on treating them appropriately in analyses, quantifying the many reasons behind missingness in consideration of selection biases. Advancements in NLP offer new opportunities in the exploitation of unstructured text from secondary care EHR data particularly given that clinical notes and attachments are available in large volumes of patients and are more routinely completed by clinicians. Tackling ways to re-use, harmonize, and improve our existing and future secondary care mental health data, leveraging advanced analytics such as NLP is worth the effort in an attempt to fill the data gap on social and behavioural contributors to mental health conditions and will be necessary to fulfill all of the domains needed to inform personalized interventions.","['1 Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, United Kingdom; 4youandme, Seattle, WA, USA.

Increasing completeness in one of these categories risks reducing completeness in the other because manually curating metadata is time consuming and is restricted by familiarity with both the data and the metadata annotation scheme. The diverse interests of a research community may drive a resource to have hundreds of metadata tags with few examples for each making it challenging for humans or machine learning algorithms to learn how to assign metadata tags properly. We demonstrate with ModelDB, a computational neuroscience model discovery resource, that using manually-curated regular-expression based rules can overcome this challenge by parsing existing texts from data providers during user data entry to suggest metadata annotations and prompt them to suggest other related metadata annotations rather than leaving the task to a curator. In the ModelDB implementation, analyzing the abstract identified 6.4 metadata tags per abstract at 79% precision. Using the full-text produced higher recall with low precision (41%), and the title alone produced few (1.3) metadata annotations per entry; we thus recommend data providers use their abstract during upload. Grouping the possible metadata annotations into categories (e.g. cell type, biological topic) revealed that precision and recall for the different text sources varies by category. Given this proof-of-concept, other bioinformatics resources can likewise improve the quality of their metadata by adopting our approach of prompting data uploaders with relevant metadata at the minimal cost of formalizing rules for each potential metadata annotation.","['1 Department of Neuroscience, Yale University, 333 Cedar Street, PO Box 208001, New Haven, CT, 06520-8001, USA. robert.mcdougal@yale.edu.', '2 Yale Center for Medical Informatics, Yale University, 300 George Street, New Haven, CT, 06510, USA. robert.mcdougal@yale.edu.', '3 Yale College, Yale University, New Haven, CT, 06520, USA.', '4 Department of Neuroscience, Yale University, 333 Cedar Street, PO Box 208001, New Haven, CT, 06520-8001, USA.']","Robert A McDougal, Isha Dalal, Thomas M Morse, Gordon M Shepherd, ",Neuroinformatics,2019 Jul,Data sharing; Metadata; Natural language processing; Repository.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30382537
877,Role of Artificial Intelligence in Patient Safety Outcomes: Systematic Literature Review,"Background:
      
    

    
      Artificial intelligence (AI) provides opportunities to identify the health risks of patients and thus influence patient safety outcomes. Objective:
      
    

    
      The purpose of this systematic literature review was to identify and analyze quantitative studies utilizing or integrating AI to address and report clinical-level patient safety outcomes. Methods:
      
    

    
      We restricted our search to the PubMed, PubMed Central, and Web of Science databases to retrieve research articles published in English between January 2009 and August 2019. We focused on quantitative studies that reported positive, negative, or intermediate changes in patient safety outcomes using AI apps, specifically those based on machine-learning algorithms and natural language processing. Quantitative studies reporting only AI performance but not its influence on patient safety outcomes were excluded from further review. Results:
      
    

    
      We identified 53 eligible studies, which were summarized concerning their patient safety subcategories, the most frequently used AI, and reported performance metrics. Recognized safety subcategories were clinical alarms (n=9; mainly based on decision tree models), clinical reports (n=21; based on support vector machine models), and drug safety (n=23; mainly based on decision tree models). Analysis of these 53 studies also identified two essential findings: (1) the lack of a standardized benchmark and (2) heterogeneity in AI reporting. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      This systematic review indicates that AI-enabled decision support systems, when implemented correctly, can aid in enhancing patient safety by improving error detection, patient stratification, and drug management. Future work is still needed for robust validation of these systems in prospective and real-world clinical environments to understand how well AI can predict safety outcomes in health care settings.","['1 School of Systems and Enterprises, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, United States.']","Avishek Choudhury, Onur Asan, ",JMIR medical informatics,2020,artificial intelligence; clinical error; drug; drug safety; natural language processing; patient safety; report analysis; review.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32706688
878,Artificial Intelligence Chatbot Behavior Change Model for Designing Artificial Intelligence Chatbots to Promote Physical Activity and a Healthy Diet: Viewpoint,"Background:
      
    

    
      Chatbots empowered by artificial intelligence (AI) can increasingly engage in natural conversations and build relationships with users. Applying AI chatbots to lifestyle modification programs is one of the promising areas to develop cost-effective and feasible behavior interventions to promote physical activity and a healthy diet. Objective:
      
    

    
      The purposes of this perspective paper are to present a brief literature review of chatbot use in promoting physical activity and a healthy diet, describe the AI chatbot behavior change model our research team developed based on extensive interdisciplinary research, and discuss ethical principles and considerations. Methods:
      
    

    
      We conducted a preliminary search of studies reporting chatbots for improving physical activity and/or diet in four databases in July 2020. We summarized the characteristics of the chatbot studies and reviewed recent developments in human-AI communication research and innovations in natural language processing. Based on the identified gaps and opportunities, as well as our own clinical and research experience and findings, we propose an AI chatbot behavior change model. Results:
      
    

    
      Our review found a lack of understanding around theoretical guidance and practical recommendations on designing AI chatbots for lifestyle modification programs. The proposed AI chatbot behavior change model consists of the following four components to provide such guidance: (1) designing chatbot characteristics and understanding user background; (2) building relational capacity; (3) building persuasive conversational capacity; and (4) evaluating mechanisms and outcomes. The rationale and evidence supporting the design and evaluation choices for this model are presented in this paper. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      As AI chatbots become increasingly integrated into various digital communications, our proposed theoretical framework is the first step to conceptualize the scope of utilization in health behavior change domains and to synthesize all possible dimensions of chatbot features to inform intervention design and evaluation. There is a need for more interdisciplinary work to continue developing AI techniques to improve a chatbot's relational and persuasive capacities to change physical activity and diet behaviors with strong ethical principles.","['1 Department of Communication, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA, United States.', '2 Department of Public Health Sciences, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA, United States.', '3 Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA, United States.', '4 Department of Physiological Nursing, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, United States.']","Jingwen Zhang, Yoo Jung Oh, Patrick Lange, Zhou Yu, Yoshimi Fukuoka, ",Journal of medical Internet research,2020,artificial intelligence; behavior change; chatbot; communication; conversational agent; diet; intervention; natural language processing; physical activity.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32996892
879,Stem cell-like breast cancer cells with acquired resistance to metformin are sensitive to inhibitors of NADH-dependent CtBP dimerization,"Altered flux through major metabolic pathways is a hallmark of cancer cells and provides opportunities for therapy. Stem cell-like cancer (SCLC) cells can cause metastasis and therapy resistance. They possess metabolic plasticity, theoretically enabling resistance to therapies targeting a specific metabolic state. The C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) transcriptional regulators are potential therapeutic targets in highly glycolytic cancer cells, as they are activated by the glycolytic coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). However, SCLC cells commonly exist in an oxidative state with low rates of glycolysis. Metformin inhibits complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain; it can kill oxidative SCLC cells and has anti-cancer activity in patients. SCLC cells can acquire resistance to metformin through increased glycolysis. Given the potential for long-term metformin therapy, we have studied acquired metformin resistance in cells from the claudin-low subtype of breast cancer. Cells cultured for 8 weeks in sub-IC50 metformin concentration proliferated comparably to untreated cells and exhibited higher rates of glucose uptake. SCLC cells were enriched in metformin-adapted cultures. These SCLC cells acquired sensitivity to multiple methods of inhibition of CtBP function, including a cyclic peptide inhibitor of NADH-induced CtBP dimerization. Single-cell mRNA sequencing identified a reprogramming of epithelial-mesenchymal and stem cell gene expression in the metformin-adapted SCLC cells. These SCLC cells demonstrated an acquired dependency on one of these genes, Tenascin C. Thus, in addition to acquisition of sensitivity to glycolysis-targeting therapeutic strategies, the reprograming of gene expression in the metformin-adapted SCLC cells renders them sensitive to potential therapeutic approaches not directly linked to cell metabolism.","['1 Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', '2 Institute for Life Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', '3 University Hospital Southampton, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', '4 Antibody and Vaccine Group, Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.']","Arindam Banerjee, Charles N Birts, Matthew Darley, Rachel Parker, Alex H Mirnezami, Jonathan West, Ramsey I Cutress, Stephen A Beers, Matthew J J Rose-Zerilli, Jeremy P Blaydes, ",Carcinogenesis,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30668646
880,The association between neighbourhood characteristics and physical victimisation in men and women with mental disorders,"Background:
      
    

    
      How neighbourhood characteristics affect the physical safety of people with mental illness is unclear. Aims:
      
    

    
      To examine neighbourhood effects on physical victimisation towards people using mental health services. Method:
      
    

    
      We developed and evaluated a machine-learning-derived free-text-based natural language processing (NLP) algorithm to ascertain clinical text referring to physical victimisation. This was applied to records on all patients attending National Health Service mental health services in Southeast London. Sociodemographic and clinical data, and diagnostic information on use of acute hospital care (from Hospital Episode Statistics, linked to Clinical Record Interactive Search), were collected in this group, defined as 'cases' and concurrently sampled controls. Multilevel logistic regression models estimated associations (odds ratios, ORs) between neighbourhood-level fragmentation, crime, income deprivation, and population density and physical victimisation. Results:
      
    

    
      Based on a human-rated gold standard, the NLP algorithm had a positive predictive value of 0.92 and sensitivity of 0.98 for (clinically recorded) physical victimisation. A 1 s.d. increase in neighbourhood crime was accompanied by a 7% increase in odds of physical victimisation in women and an 13% increase in men (adjusted OR (aOR) for women: 1.07, 95% CI 1.01-1.14, aOR for men: 1.13, 95% CI 1.06-1.21, P for gender interaction, 0.218). Although small, adjusted associations for neighbourhood fragmentation appeared greater in magnitude for women (aOR = 1.05, 95% CI 1.01-1.11) than men, where this association was not statistically significant (aOR = 1.00, 95% CI 0.95-1.04, P for gender interaction, 0.096). Neighbourhood income deprivation was associated with victimisation in men and women with similar magnitudes of association. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Neighbourhood factors influencing safety, as well as individual characteristics including gender, may be relevant to understanding pathways to physical victimisation towards people with mental illness.","[""1 Section of Women's Mental Health, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, UK."", '2 Clinical Informatics, BRC Nucleus, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, UK.', ""3 Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, UK."", ""4 King's College London, UK."", '5 BRC Nucleus, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, UK.', ""6 Department of Psychosis Studies, King's College London, UK."", ""7 Department of Health Services and Population Research, King's College London, UK.""]","Vishal Bhavsar, Jyoti Sanyal, Rashmi Patel, Hitesh Shetty, Sumithra Velupillai, Robert Stewart, Matthew Broadbent, James H MacCabe, Jayati Das-Munshi, Louise M Howard, ",BJPsych open,2020,Natural language processing; data linkage; electronic health records; neighbourhood characteristics; violence.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32669154

      Although falls are among the most common adverse event in hospitals, they are difficult to measure and often unreported. Mechanisms to track falls include incident reporting and medical records review. Because of limitations of each method, researchers suggest multimodal approaches. Although incident reporting is commonly used, medical records review is limited by the need to read a high volume of clinical notes. Natural language processing (NLP) is 1 potential mechanism to automate this process. Method:
      
    

    
      We compared automated NLP to manual chart review and incident reporting as a method to detect falls among inpatients. First, we developed an NLP algorithm to identify inpatient progress notes describing falls. Second, we compared the NLP algorithm to manual records review in identifying inpatient progress notes that describe falls. Third, we compared the NLP algorithm to the incident reporting system in identifying falls. Results:
      
    

    
      When examining individual inpatient notes, our NLP algorithm was highly specific (0.97) but had low sensitivity (0.44) when compared with our manual records review. However, when considering groups of inpatient notes, all describing the same fall, our NLP algorithm had a large improvement in sensitivity (0.80) with some loss of specificity (0.65) compared with incident reporting. Conclusions:

883,Annotating Temporal Relations to Determine the Onset of Psychosis Symptoms,"For patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, determining symptom onset is crucial for timely and successful intervention. In mental health records, information about early symptoms is often documented only in free text, and thus needs to be extracted to support clinical research. To achieve this, natural language processing (NLP) methods can be used. Development and evaluation of NLP systems requires manually annotated corpora. We present a corpus of mental health records annotated with temporal relations for psychosis symptoms. We propose a methodology for document selection and manual annotation to detect symptom onset information, and develop an annotated corpus. To assess the utility of the created corpus, we propose a pilot NLP system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first temporally-annotated corpus tailored to a specific clinical use-case.","[""1 Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK."", '2 South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.', '3 School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, KTH, Stockholm, Sweden.']","Natalia Viani, Joyce Kam, Lucia Yin, Somain Verma, Robert Stewart, Rashmi Patel, Sumithra Velupillai, ",Studies in health technology and informatics,2019,Electronic Health Records; Natural Language Processing; Schizophrenia.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31437957
884,Analysis of risk factor domains in psychosis patient health records,"Background:
      
    

    
      Readmission after discharge from a hospital is disruptive and costly, regardless of the reason. However, it can be particularly problematic for psychiatric patients, so predicting which patients may be readmitted is critically important but also very difficult. Clinical narratives in psychiatric electronic health records (EHRs) span a wide range of topics and vocabulary; therefore, a psychiatric readmission prediction model must begin with a robust and interpretable topic extraction component. Results:
      
    

    
      We designed and evaluated multiple multilayer perceptron and radial basis function neural networks to predict the sentences in a patient's EHR that are associated with one or more of seven readmission risk factor domains that we identified. In contrast to our baseline cosine similarity model that is based on the methodologies of prior works, our deep learning approaches achieved considerably better F1 scores (0.83 vs 0.66) while also being more scalable and computationally efficient with large volumes of data. Additionally, we found that integrating clinically relevant multiword expressions during preprocessing improves the accuracy of our models and allows for identifying a wider scope of training data in a semi-supervised setting. Conclusion:

      The aim of this study was to enhance multispecialty CT and MRI protocol assignment quality and efficiency through development, testing, and proposed workflow design of a natural language processing (NLP)-based machine learning classifier. Methods:
      
    

    
      NLP-based machine learning classification models were developed using order entry input data and radiologist-assigned protocols from more than 18,000 unique CT and MRI examinations obtained during routine clinical use. k-Nearest neighbor, random forest, and deep neural network classification models were evaluated at baseline and after applying class frequency and confidence thresholding techniques. To simulate performance in real-world deployment, the model was evaluated in two operating modes in combination: automation (automated assignment of the top result) and clinical decision support (CDS; top-three protocol suggestion for clinical review). Finally, model-radiologist discordance was subjectively reviewed to guide explainability and safe use. Results:
      
    

    
      Baseline protocol assignment performance achieved weighted precision of 0.757 to 0.824. Simulating real-world deployment using combined thresholding techniques, the optimized deep neural network model assigned 69% of protocols in automation mode with 95% accuracy. In the remaining 31% of cases, the model achieved 92% accuracy in CDS mode. Analysis of discordance with subspecialty radiologist labels revealed both more and less appropriate model predictions. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      A multiclass NLP-based classification algorithm was designed to drive local operational improvement in CT and MR radiology protocol assignment at subspecialist quality. The results demonstrate a simulated workflow deployment enabling automated assignment of protocols in nearly 7 of 10 cases with very few errors combined with top-three CDS for remaining cases supporting a high-quality, efficient radiology workflow.","['1 Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

886,Using Lexical Chains to Identify Text Difficulty: A Corpus Statistics and Classification Study,"Our goal is data-driven discovery of features for text simplification. In this paper, we investigate three types of lexical chains: exact, synonymous, and semantic. A lexical chain links semantically related words in a document. We examine their potential with a document-level corpus statistics study (914 texts) to estimate their overall capacity to differentiate between easy and difficult text and a classification task (11 000 sentences) to determine usefulness of features at sentence-level for simplification. For the corpus statistics study we tested five document-level features for each chain type: total number of chains, average chain length, average chain span, number of crossing chains, and the number of chains longer than half the document length. We found significant differences between easy and difficult text for average chain length and the average number of cross chains. For the sentence classification study, we compared the lexical chain features to standard bag-of-words features on a range of classifiers: logistic regression, naïve Bayes, decision trees, linear and RBF kernel SVM, and random forest. The lexical chain features performed significantly better than the bag-of-words baseline across all classifiers with the best classifier achieving an accuracy of ∼90% (compared to 78% for bag-of-words).

887,Cost-aware active learning for named entity recognition in clinical text,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Active Learning (AL) attempts to reduce annotation cost (ie, time) by selecting the most informative examples for annotation. Most approaches tacitly (and unrealistically) assume that the cost for annotating each sample is identical. This study introduces a cost-aware AL method, which simultaneously models both the annotation cost and the informativeness of the samples and evaluates both via simulation and user studies. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      We designed a novel, cost-aware AL algorithm (Cost-CAUSE) for annotating clinical named entities; we first utilized lexical and syntactic features to estimate annotation cost, then we incorporated this cost measure into an existing AL algorithm. Using the 2010 i2b2/VA data set, we then conducted a simulation study comparing Cost-CAUSE with noncost-aware AL methods, and a user study comparing Cost-CAUSE with passive learning. Results:
      
    

    
      Our cost model fit empirical annotation data well, and Cost-CAUSE increased the simulation area under the learning curve (ALC) scores by up to 5.6% and 4.9%, compared with random sampling and alternate AL methods. Moreover, in a user annotation task, Cost-CAUSE outperformed passive learning on the ALC score and reduced annotation time by 20.5%-30.2%. Discussion:
      
    

    
      Although AL has proven effective in simulations, our user study shows that a real-world environment is far more complex. Other factors have a noticeable effect on the AL method, such as the annotation accuracy of users, the tiredness of users, and even the physical and mental condition of users.

888,Receiver-Side TCP Countermeasure in Cellular Networks,"Cellular-based networks keep large buffers at base stations to smooth out the bursty data traffic, which has a negative impact on the user's Quality of Experience (QoE). With the boom of smart vehicles and phones, this has drawn growing attention. For this paper, we first conducted experiments to reveal the large delays, thus long flow completion time (FCT), caused by the large buffer in the cellular networks. Then, a receiver-side transmission control protocol (TCP) countermeasure named Delay-based Flow Control algorithm with Service Differentiation (DFCSD) was proposed to target interactive applications requiring high throughput and low delay in cellular networks by limiting the standing queue size and decreasing the amount of packets that are dropped in the eNodeB in Long Term Evolution (LTE). DFCSD stems from delay-based congestion control algorithms but works at the receiver side to avoid the performance degradation of the delay-based algorithms when competing with loss-based mechanisms. In addition, it is derived based on the TCP fluid model to maximize the network utility. Furthermore, DFCSD also takes service differentiation into consideration based on the size of competing flows to shorten their completion time, thus improving user QoE. Simulation results confirmed that DFCSD is compatible with existing TCP algorithms, significantly reduces the latency of TCP flows, and increases network throughput.","['1 College of Information Science and Engineering, Hunan Normal University, Changsha 410081, China. ppdong@csu.edu.cn.', '2 Hunnan Provincial Key Laboratory of Intelligent Computing and Language Information Processing, Hunan Normal University, Changsha 410081, China. ppdong@csu.edu.cn.', '3 College of Automotive and Mechanical Engineering, Changsha University of Science & Technology, Changsha 410114, China. kai_g@csust.edu.cn.', '4 Hunan Key Laboratory of Smart Roadway and Cooperative Vehicle-Infrastructure Systems, Changsha 410114, China. kai_g@csust.edu.cn.', '5 College of Information Science and Engineering, Hunan Normal University, Changsha 410081, China. jingyunxie1995@gmail.com.', '6 Hunnan Provincial Key Laboratory of Intelligent Computing and Language Information Processing, Hunan Normal University, Changsha 410081, China. jingyunxie1995@gmail.com.', '7 College of Information Science and Engineering, Hunan Normal University, Changsha 410081, China.

      To develop novel, scalable, and valid literacy profiles for identifying limited health literacy patients by harnessing natural language processing. Data source:
      
    

    
      With respect to the linguistic content, we analyzed 283 216 secure messages sent by 6941 diabetes patients to physicians within an integrated system's electronic portal. Sociodemographic, clinical, and utilization data were obtained via questionnaire and electronic health records. Study design:
      
    

    
      Retrospective study used natural language processing and machine learning to generate five unique ""Literacy Profiles"" by employing various sets of linguistic indices: Flesch-Kincaid (LP_FK); basic indices of writing complexity, including lexical diversity (LP_LD) and writing quality (LP_WQ); and advanced indices related to syntactic complexity, lexical sophistication, and diversity, modeled from self-reported (LP_SR), and expert-rated (LP_Exp) health literacy. We first determined the performance of each literacy profile relative to self-reported and expert-rated health literacy to discriminate between high and low health literacy and then assessed Literacy Profiles' relationships with known correlates of health literacy, such as patient sociodemographics and a range of health-related outcomes, including ratings of physician communication, medication adherence, diabetes control, comorbidities, and utilization. Principal findings:
      
    

    
      LP_SR and LP_Exp performed best in discriminating between high and low self-reported (C-statistics: 0.86 and 0.58, respectively) and expert-rated health literacy (C-statistics: 0.71 and 0.87, respectively) and were significantly associated with educational attainment, race/ethnicity, Consumer Assessment of Provider and Systems (CAHPS) scores, adherence, glycemia, comorbidities, and emergency department visits.

      Since health literacy is a potentially remediable explanatory factor in health care disparities, the development of automated health literacy indicators represents a significant accomplishment with broad clinical and population health applications.

890,Social Reminiscence in Older Adults' Everyday Conversations: Automated Detection Using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning,"Background:
      
    

    
      Reminiscence is the act of thinking or talking about personal experiences that occurred in the past. It is a central task of old age that is essential for healthy aging, and it serves multiple functions, such as decision-making and introspection, transmitting life lessons, and bonding with others. The study of social reminiscence behavior in everyday life can be used to generate data and detect reminiscence from general conversations. Objective:
      
    

    
      The aims of this original paper are to (1) preprocess coded transcripts of conversations in German of older adults with natural language processing (NLP), and (2) implement and evaluate learning strategies using different NLP features and machine learning algorithms to detect reminiscence in a corpus of transcripts. Methods:
      
    

    
      The methods in this study comprise (1) collecting and coding of transcripts of older adults' conversations in German, (2) preprocessing transcripts to generate NLP features (bag-of-words models, part-of-speech tags, pretrained German word embeddings), and (3) training machine learning models to detect reminiscence using random forests, support vector machines, and adaptive and extreme gradient boosting algorithms. The data set comprises 2214 transcripts, including 109 transcripts with reminiscence. Due to class imbalance in the data, we introduced three learning strategies: (1) class-weighted learning, (2) a meta-classifier consisting of a voting ensemble, and (3) data augmentation with the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) algorithm. For each learning strategy, we performed cross-validation on a random sample of the training data set of transcripts. We computed the area under the curve (AUC), the average precision (AP), precision, recall, as well as F1 score and specificity measures on the test data, for all combinations of NLP features, algorithms, and learning strategies. Results:
      
    

    
      Class-weighted support vector machines on bag-of-words features outperformed all other classifiers (AUC=0.91, AP=0.56, precision=0.5, recall=0.45, F1=0.48, specificity=0.98), followed by support vector machines on SMOTE-augmented data and word embeddings features (AUC=0.89, AP=0.54, precision=0.35, recall=0.59, F1=0.44, specificity=0.94). For the meta-classifier strategy, adaptive and extreme gradient boosting algorithms trained on word embeddings and bag-of-words outperformed all other classifiers and NLP features; however, the performance of the meta-classifier learning strategy was lower compared to other strategies, with highly imbalanced precision-recall trade-offs. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      This study provides evidence of the applicability of NLP and machine learning pipelines for the automated detection of reminiscence in older adults' everyday conversations in German. The methods and findings of this study could be relevant for designing unobtrusive computer systems for the real-time detection of social reminiscence in the everyday life of older adults and classifying their functions. With further improvements, these systems could be deployed in health interventions aimed at improving older adults' well-being by promoting self-reflection and suggesting coping strategies to be used in the case of dysfunctional reminiscence cases, which can undermine physical and mental health.","['1 Department of Management, Technology, and Economics, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', '2 Department of Psychology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', '3 University Research Priority Program, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', '4 Collegium Helveticum, Zurich, Switzerland.', '5 Institute of Computer Science, University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany.', '6 Institute of Visual & Analytic Computing, University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany.', '7 Interdisciplinary Faculty Ageing of Individuals and Society, University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany.', '8 School of Psychology, Faculty of Health and Behavioural Sciences, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.']","Andrea Ferrario, Burcu Demiray, Kristina Yordanova, Minxia Luo, Mike Martin, ",Journal of medical Internet research,2020,aging; dementia; electronically activated recorder (EAR); imbalanced learning; machine learning; natural language processing; real-life conversations; reminiscence.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32866108
891,Automatic inference of BI-RADS final assessment categories from narrative mammography report findings,"We propose an efficient natural language processing approach for inferring the BI-RADS final assessment categories by analyzing only the mammogram findings reported by the mammographer in narrative form. The proposed hybrid method integrates semantic term embedding with distributional semantics, producing a context-aware vector representation of unstructured mammography reports. A large corpus of unannotated mammography reports (300,000) was used to learn the context of the key-terms using a distributional semantics approach, and the trained model was applied to generate context-aware vector representations of the reports annotated with BI-RADS category (22,091). The vectorized reports were utilized to train a supervised classifier to derive the BI-RADS assessment class. Even though the majority of the proposed embedding pipeline is unsupervised, the classifier was able to recognize substantial semantic information for deriving the BI-RADS categorization not only on a holdout internal testset and also on an external validation set (1900 reports). Our proposed method outperforms a recently published domain-specific rule-based system and could be relevant for evaluating concordance between radiologists. With minimal requirement for task specific customization, the proposed method can be easily transferable to a different domain to support large scale text mining or derivation of patient phenotype.","['1 Department of Biomedical Data Science, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.

892,An annotated data set for identifying women reporting adverse pregnancy outcomes on Twitter,"Despite the prevalence in the United States of miscarriage [1], stillbirth [2], and infant mortality associated with preterm birth and low birthweight [3], their causes remain largely unknown [4], [5], [6]. To advance the use of social media data as a complementary resource for epidemiology of adverse pregnancy outcomes, we present a data set of 6487 tweets that mention miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm birth or premature labor, low birthweight, neonatal intensive care, or fetal/infant loss in general. These tweets are a subset of 22,912 tweets retrieved by applying hand-written regular expressions to a database containing more than 400 million public tweets posted by more than 100,000 women who have announced their pregnancy on Twitter [7]. Two professional annotators labeled the 6487 tweets in a binary fashion, distinguishing those potentially reporting that the user has personally experienced the outcome (""outcome"" tweets) from those that merely mention the outcome (""non-outcome"" tweets). Inter-annotator agreement was κ = 0.90 (Cohen's kappa). The tweets annotated as ""outcome"" include 1318 women reporting miscarriage, 94 stillbirth, 591 preterm birth or premature labor, 171 low birthweight, 453 neonatal intensive care, and 356 fetal/infant loss in general. These ""outcome"" tweets can be used to explore patient experiences and perceptions of adverse pregnancy outcomes, and can direct researchers to the users' broader timelines-tweets posted by a user over time-for observational studies. Our past work demonstrates the analysis of timelines for selecting a study population [8] and conducting a case-control study [9] of users reporting that their child has a birth defect. For larger-scale studies, the full annotated corpus can be used to train supervised machine learning algorithms to automatically identify additional users reporting adverse pregnancy outcomes on Twitter. We used the annotated corpus to train feature-engineered and deep learning-based classifiers presented in ""A natural language processing pipeline to advance the use of Twitter data for digital epidemiology of adverse pregnancy outcomes"" [10].","['1 University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']","Ari Z Klein, Graciela Gonzalez-Hernandez, ",Data in brief,2020,Data mining; Epidemiology; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Pregnancy; Social media.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32944604

In the illustrative case studies, natural language processing from social media, news feeds, and websites was used for information extraction, biosurveillance, and situation awareness.

895,Gene expression based survival prediction for cancer patients-A topic modeling approach,"Cancer is one of the leading cause of death, worldwide. Many believe that genomic data will enable us to better predict the survival time of these patients, which will lead to better, more personalized treatment options and patient care. As standard survival prediction models have a hard time coping with the high-dimensionality of such gene expression data, many projects use some dimensionality reduction techniques to overcome this hurdle. We introduce a novel methodology, inspired by topic modeling from the natural language domain, to derive expressive features from the high-dimensional gene expression data. There, a document is represented as a mixture over a relatively small number of topics, where each topic corresponds to a distribution over the words; here, to accommodate the heterogeneity of a patient's cancer, we represent each patient (≈ document) as a mixture over cancer-topics, where each cancer-topic is a mixture over gene expression values (≈ words). This required some extensions to the standard LDA model-e.g., to accommodate the real-valued expression values-leading to our novel discretized Latent Dirichlet Allocation (dLDA) procedure. After using this dLDA to learn these cancer-topics, we can then express each patient as a distribution over a small number of cancer-topics, then use this low-dimensional ""distribution vector"" as input to a learning algorithm-here, we ran the recent survival prediction algorithm, MTLR, on this representation of the cancer dataset. We initially focus on the METABRIC dataset, which describes each of n = 1,981 breast cancer patients using the r = 49,576 gene expression values, from microarrays. Our results show that our approach (dLDA followed by MTLR) provides survival estimates that are more accurate than standard models, in terms of the standard Concordance measure. We then validate this ""dLDA+MTLR"" approach by running it on the n = 883 Pan-kidney (KIPAN) dataset, over r = 15,529 gene expression values-here using the mRNAseq modality-and find that it again achieves excellent results. In both cases, we also show that the resulting model is calibrated, using the recent ""D-calibrated"" measure. These successes, in two different cancer types and expression modalities, demonstrates the generality, and the effectiveness, of this approach.

896,Video Captioning with Object-Aware Spatio-Temporal Correlation and Aggregation,"Video captioning is a significant challenging task in computer vision and natural language processing, aiming to automatically describe video content by natural language sentences. Comprehensive understanding of video is the key for accurate video captioning, which needs to not only capture the global content and salient objects in video, but also understand the spatio-temporal relations of objects, including their temporal trajectories and spatial relationships. Thus, it is important for video captioning to capture the objects' relationships both within and across frames. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an object-aware spatio-temporal graph (OSTG) approach for video captioning. It constructs spatio-temporal graphs to depict objects with their relations, where the temporal graphs represent objects' inter-frame dynamics, and the spatial graphs represent objects' intra-frame interactive relationships. The main novelties and advantages are: (1) Bidirectional temporal alignment: Bidirectional temporal graph is constructed along and reversely along the temporal order to perform bidirectional temporal alignment for objects across different frames, which provides complementary clues to capture the inter-frame temporal trajectories for each salient object. (2) Graph based spatial relation learning: Spatial relation graph is constructed among objects in each frame by considering their relative spatial locations and semantic correlations, which is exploited to learn relation features that encode intra-frame relationships for salient objects. (3) Object-aware feature aggregation: Trainable VLAD (vector of locally aggregated descriptors) models are deployed to perform object-aware feature aggregation on objects' local features, which learn discriminative aggregated representations for better video captioning. A hierarchical attention mechanism is also developed to distinguish contributions of different object instances.

898,Diagnosis of genetic diseases in seriously ill children by rapid whole-genome sequencing and automated phenotyping and interpretation,"By informing timely targeted treatments, rapid whole-genome sequencing can improve the outcomes of seriously ill children with genetic diseases, particularly infants in neonatal and pediatric intensive care units (ICUs). The need for highly qualified professionals to decipher results, however, precludes widespread implementation. We describe a platform for population-scale, provisional diagnosis of genetic diseases with automated phenotyping and interpretation. Genome sequencing was expedited by bead-based genome library preparation directly from blood samples and sequencing of paired 100-nt reads in 15.5 hours. Clinical natural language processing (CNLP) automatically extracted children's deep phenomes from electronic health records with 80% precision and 93% recall. In 101 children with 105 genetic diseases, a mean of 4.3 CNLP-extracted phenotypic features matched the expected phenotypic features of those diseases, compared with a match of 0.9 phenotypic features used in manual interpretation. We automated provisional diagnosis by combining the ranking of the similarity of a patient's CNLP phenome with respect to the expected phenotypic features of all genetic diseases, together with the ranking of the pathogenicity of all of the patient's genomic variants. Automated, retrospective diagnoses concurred well with expert manual interpretation (97% recall and 99% precision in 95 children with 97 genetic diseases). Prospectively, our platform correctly diagnosed three of seven seriously ill ICU infants (100% precision and recall) with a mean time saving of 22:19 hours. In each case, the diagnosis affected treatment. Genome sequencing with automated phenotyping and interpretation in a median of 20:10 hours may increase adoption in ICUs and, thereby, timely implementation of precise treatments.","[""1 Rady Children's Institute for Genomic Medicine, San Diego, CA 92123, USA."", '2 Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Diego, San Diego, CA 92093, USA.', '3 Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA.', '4 Diploid, 3001 Leuven, Belgium.', '5 Clinithink Ltd., London N1 6DR, UK.', '6 Codified Genomics, LLC, Houston, TX 77033, USA.', ""7 Rady Children's Hospital, San Diego, CA 92123, USA."", '8 Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc., New Haven, CT 06510, USA.', '9 University of Kansas School of Medicine, Kansas City, MO 66160, USA.', '10 Department of Neurosciences, University of California San Diego, San Diego, CA 92093, USA.', '11 Tessella, Needham, MA 02494, USA.', '12 Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA 92122, USA.', '13 Fabric Genomics Inc., Oakland, CA 94612, USA.', ""14 Rady Children's Institute for Genomic Medicine, San Diego, CA 92123, USA. skingsmore@rchsd.org.""]","Michelle M Clark, Amber Hildreth, Sergey Batalov, Yan Ding, Shimul Chowdhury, Kelly Watkins, Katarzyna Ellsworth, Brandon Camp, Cyrielle I Kint, Calum Yacoubian, Lauge Farnaes, Matthew N Bainbridge, Curtis Beebe, Joshua J A Braun, Margaret Bray, Jeanne Carroll, Julie A Cakici, Sara A Caylor, Christina Clarke, Mitchell P Creed, Jennifer Friedman, Alison Frith, Richard Gain, Mary Gaughran, Shauna George, Sheldon Gilmer, Joseph Gleeson, Jeremy Gore, Haiying Grunenwald, Raymond L Hovey, Marie L Janes, Kejia Lin, Paul D McDonagh, Kyle McBride, Patrick Mulrooney, Shareef Nahas, Daeheon Oh, Albert Oriol, Laura Puckett, Zia Rady, Martin G Reese, Julie Ryu, Lisa Salz, Erica Sanford, Lawrence Stewart, Nathaly Sweeney, Mari Tokita, Luca Van Der Kraan, Sarah White, Kristen Wigby, Brett Williams, Terence Wong, Meredith S Wright, Catherine Yamada, Peter Schols, John Reynders, Kevin Hall, David Dimmock, Narayanan Veeraraghavan, Thomas Defay, Stephen F Kingsmore, ",Science translational medicine,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31019026

      Sarcopenia, cachexia and frailty have overlapping features and clinical consequences, but often go unrecognized. The objective was to detect patients described by clinicians as having sarcopenia, cachexia or frailty within electronic health records (EHR) and compare clinical variables between cases and matched controls. Methods:
      
    

    
      We conducted a case-control study using retrospective data from the Indiana Network for Patient Care multi-health system database from 2016 to 2017. The computable phenotype combined ICD codes for sarcopenia, cachexia and frailty, with clinical note text terms for sarcopenia, cachexia and frailty detected using natural language processing. Cases with these codes or text terms were matched to controls without these codes or text terms matched on birth year, sex and race. Two physicians reviewed EHR for all cases and a subset of controls. Comorbidity codes, laboratory values, and other coded clinical variables were compared between groups using Wilcoxon matched-pair sign-rank test for continuous variables and conditional logistic regression for binary variables. Results:
      
    

    
      Cohorts of 9594 cases and 9594 matched controls were generated. Cases were 59% female, 69% white, and a median (1st, 3rd quartiles) age 74.9 (62.2, 84.8) years. Most cases were detected by text terms without ICD codes n = 8285 (86.4%). All cases detected by ICD codes (total n = 1309) also had supportive text terms. Overall 1496 (15.6%) had concurrent terms or codes for two or more of the three conditions (sarcopenia, cachexia or frailty). Of text term occurrence, 97% were used positively for sarcopenia, 90% for cachexia, and 95% for frailty. The remaining occurrences were negative uses of the terms or applied to someone other than the patient. Cases had lower body mass index, albumin and prealbumin, and significantly higher odds ratios for diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular and peripheral vascular diseases, chronic kidney disease, liver disease, malignancy, osteoporosis and fractures (all p < 0.05). Cases were more likely to be prescribed appetite stimulants and caloric supplements. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Patients detected with a computable phenotype for sarcopenia, cachexia and frailty differed from controls in several important clinical variables.

900,Automated Triaging of Adult Chest Radiographs with Deep Artificial Neural Networks,"Purpose To develop and test an artificial intelligence (AI) system, based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for automated real-time triaging of adult chest radiographs on the basis of the urgency of imaging appearances. Materials and Methods An AI system was developed by using 470 388 fully anonymized institutional adult chest radiographs acquired from 2007 to 2017. The free-text radiology reports were preprocessed by using an in-house natural language processing (NLP) system modeling radiologic language. The NLP system analyzed the free-text report to prioritize each radiograph as critical, urgent, nonurgent, or normal. An AI system for computer vision using an ensemble of two deep CNNs was then trained by using labeled radiographs to predict the clinical priority from radiologic appearances only. The system's performance in radiograph prioritization was tested in a simulation by using an independent set of 15 887 radiographs. Prediction performance was assessed with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve; sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were also determined. Nonparametric testing of the improvement in time to final report was determined at a nominal significance level of 5%. Results Normal chest radiographs were detected by our AI system with a sensitivity of 71%, specificity of 95%, PPV of 73%, and NPV of 94%. The average reporting delay was reduced from 11.2 to 2.7 days for critical imaging findings (P < .001) and from 7.6 to 4.1 days for urgent imaging findings (P < .001) in the simulation compared with historical data.

901,Using Twitter to Surveil the Opioid Epidemic in North Carolina: An Exploratory Study,"Background:
      
    

    
      Over the last two decades, deaths associated with opioids have escalated in number and geographic spread, impacting more and more individuals, families, and communities. Reflecting on the shifting nature of the opioid overdose crisis, Dasgupta, Beletsky, and Ciccarone offer a triphasic framework to explain that opioid overdose deaths (OODs) shifted from prescription opioids for pain (beginning in 2000), to heroin (2010 to 2015), and then to synthetic opioids (beginning in 2013). Given the rapidly shifting nature of OODs, timelier surveillance data are critical to inform strategies that combat the opioid crisis. Using easily accessible and near real-time social media data to improve public health surveillance efforts related to the opioid crisis is a promising area of research. Objective:
      
    

    
      This study explored the potential of using Twitter data to monitor the opioid epidemic. Specifically, this study investigated the extent to which the content of opioid-related tweets corresponds with the triphasic nature of the opioid crisis and correlates with OODs in North Carolina between 2009 and 2017. Methods:
      
    

    
      Opioid-related Twitter posts were obtained using Crimson Hexagon, and were classified as relating to prescription opioids, heroin, and synthetic opioids using natural language processing. This process resulted in a corpus of 100,777 posts consisting of tweets, retweets, mentions, and replies. Using a random sample of 10,000 posts from the corpus, we identified opioid-related terms by analyzing word frequency for each year. OODs were obtained from the Multiple Cause of Death database from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (CDC WONDER). Least squares regression and Granger tests compared patterns of opioid-related posts with OODs. Results:
      
    

    
      The pattern of tweets related to prescription opioids, heroin, and synthetic opioids resembled the triphasic nature of OODs. For prescription opioids, tweet counts and OODs were statistically unrelated. Tweets mentioning heroin and synthetic opioids were significantly associated with heroin OODs and synthetic OODs in the same year (P=.01 and P<.001, respectively), as well as in the following year (P=.03 and P=.01, respectively). Moreover, heroin tweets in a given year predicted heroin deaths better than lagged heroin OODs alone (P=.03). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Findings support using Twitter data as a timely indicator of opioid overdose mortality, especially for heroin.","['1 North Carolina A&T State University, Greensboro, NC, United States.', '2 Research Triangle Institute International, Research Triangle Park, NC, United States.']","Mohd Anwar, Dalia Khoury, Arnie P Aldridge, Stephanie J Parker, Kevin P Conway, ",JMIR public health and surveillance,2020,opioids; social media; surveillance.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32469322
902,How to do things with (thousands of) words: Computational approaches to discourse analysis in Alzheimer's disease,"Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an ever-growing field of computational science that aims to model natural human language. Combined with advances in machine learning, which learns patterns in data, it offers practical capabilities including automated language analysis. These approaches have garnered interest from clinical researchers seeking to understand the breakdown of language due to pathological changes in the brain, offering fast, replicable and objective methods. The study of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and preclinical Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), suggests that changes in discourse (connected speech or writing) may be key to early detection of disease. There is currently no disease-modifying treatment for AD, the leading cause of dementia in people over the age of 65, but detection of those at risk of developing the disease could help with the identification and testing of medications which can take effect before the underlying pathology has irreversibly spread. We outline important components of natural language, as well as NLP tools and approaches with which they can be extracted, analysed and used for disease identification and risk prediction. We review literature using these tools to model discourse across the spectrum of AD, including the contribution of machine learning approaches and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). We conclude that NLP and machine learning techniques are starting to greatly enhance research in the field, with measurable and quantifiable language components showing promise for early detection of disease, but there remain research and practical challenges for clinical implementation of these approaches. Challenges discussed include the availability of large and diverse datasets, ethics of data collection and sharing, diagnostic specificity and clinical acceptability.","[""1 Neurosciences Research Centre, Molecular & Clinical Sciences Research Institute, St George's, University of London, Cranmer Terrace, London, UK.

903,Menagerie: A text-mining tool to support animal-human translation in neurodegeneration research,"Discovery studies in animals constitute a cornerstone of biomedical research, but suffer from lack of generalizability to human populations. We propose that large-scale interrogation of these data could reveal patterns of animal use that could narrow the translational divide. We describe a text-mining approach that extracts translationally useful data from PubMed abstracts. These comprise six modules: species, model, genes, interventions/disease modifiers, overall outcome and functional outcome measures. Existing National Library of Medicine natural language processing tools (SemRep, GNormPlus and the Chemical annotator) underpin the program and are further augmented by various rules, term lists, and machine learning models. Evaluation of the program using a 98-abstract test set achieved F1 scores ranging from 0.75-0.95 across all modules, and exceeded F1 scores obtained from comparable baseline programs. Next, the program was applied to a larger 14,481 abstract data set (2008-2017). Expected and previously identified patterns of species and model use for the field were obtained. As previously noted, the majority of studies reported promising outcomes. Longitudinal patterns of intervention type or gene mentions were demonstrated, and patterns of animal model use characteristic of the Parkinson's disease field were confirmed. The primary function of the program is to overcome low external validity of animal model systems by aggregating evidence across a diversity of models that capture different aspects of a multifaceted cellular process. Some aspects of the tool are generalizable, whereas others are field-specific. In the initial version presented here, we demonstrate proof of concept within a single disease area, Parkinson's disease. However, the program can be expanded in modular fashion to support a wider range of neurodegenerative diseases.","['1 Department of Comparative Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, United States of America.', '2 Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications, National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.', '3 Department of Internal Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, United States of America.', '4 Department of Pathology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, United States of America.', '5 Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, United States of America.']","Caroline J Zeiss, Dongwook Shin, Brent Vander Wyk, Amanda P Beck, Natalie Zatz, Charles A Sneiderman, Halil Kilicoglu, ",PloS one,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31846471
904,Mining social media data to assess the risk of skin and soft tissue infections from allergen immunotherapy,"Background:
      
    

    
      Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) treatment for allergic rhinitis and asthma is used by 2.6 million Americans annually. Clinical and sterility testing studies identify no risk of contamination or infection from extracts prepared using recommended aseptic techniques, but regulatory concerns persist. Social media can be used to investigate rare adverse effects not captured by traditional studies. Objective:
      
    

    
      We sought to investigate large social media databases for suggestion of AIT skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) risk and compare this risk to a comparator procedure with a sterile pharmaceutical. Methods:
      
    

    
      We analyzed US-restricted data from more than 10 common text-based social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit between 2012 and 2016. We used natural language processing (NLP) to identify posts related to AIT and, separately, influenza vaccination (comparator procedure). NLP was followed by manual review to identify posts suggesting a possible SSTI associated with either AIT or influenza vaccination. SSTI frequencies with 95% CIs were compared. Results:
      
    

    
      We identified 25,126 AIT posts, which were matched by social media platform to 25,126 influenza vaccination-related posts. NLP identified 4088 (16.3%) AIT posts that required manual review, with 6 posts (0.02%; 95% CI, 0.005%-0.043%) indicative of possible AIT-related SSTI. NLP identified 2689 (10.7%) influenza posts that required manual review, with 7 posts (0.03%; 95% CI, 0.007%-0.048%) indicative of possible influenza vaccination-related SSTI. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Social media data suggest that SSTI from AIT and influenza vaccination are equally rare events. Given that AIT's SSTI risk appears comparable to the risk using a sterile pharmaceutical based on social media data, current aseptic technique procedures seem safe.","['1 Division of Rheumatology, Allergy and Immunology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Mass; Harvard Medical School, Boston, Mass.', ""2 Cheryl Spencer Department of Nursing, University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel; Division of General Internal Medicine and Primary Care, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Mass."", ""3 Harvard Medical School, Boston, Mass; Division of General Internal Medicine and Primary Care, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Mass."", '4 Division of Rheumatology, Allergy and Immunology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Mass.', '5 Treato Ltd, Or Yehuda, Israel.', '6 Cheryl Spencer Department of Nursing, University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel.', '7 Division of Rheumatology, Allergy and Immunology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Mass; Harvard Medical School, Boston, Mass.

905,Multidimensional informatic deconvolution defines gender-specific roles of hypothalamic GIT2 in aging trajectories,"In most species, females live longer than males. An understanding of this female longevity advantage will likely uncover novel anti-aging therapeutic targets. Here we investigated the transcriptomic responses in the hypothalamus - a key organ for somatic aging control - to the introduction of a simple aging-related molecular perturbation, i.e. GIT2 heterozygosity. Our previous work has demonstrated that GIT2 acts as a network controller of aging. A similar number of both total (1079-female, 1006-male) and gender-unique (577-female, 527-male) transcripts were significantly altered in response to GIT2 heterozygosity in early life-stage (2 month-old) mice. Despite a similar volume of transcriptomic disruption in females and males, a considerably stronger dataset coherency and functional annotation representation was observed for females. It was also evident that female mice possessed a greater resilience to pro-aging signaling pathways compared to males. Using a highly data-dependent natural language processing informatics pipeline, we identified novel functional data clusters that were connected by a coherent group of multifunctional transcripts. From these it was clear that females prioritized metabolic activity preservation compared to males to mitigate this pro-aging perturbation. These findings were corroborated by somatic metabolism analyses of living animals, demonstrating the efficacy of our new informatics pipeline.","['1 Receptor Biology Lab, Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Antwerp, 2610, Wilrijk, Belgium.', '2 Metabolism Unit, Laboratory of Clinical Investigation, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, Biomedical Research Center, 251 Bayview Boulevard, Baltimore, MD, 21224, United States.', '3 Receptor Pharmacology Unit, Laboratory of Neuroscience, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, Biomedical Research Center, 251 Bayview Boulevard, Baltimore, MD, 21224, United States.', '4 Gene Expression and Genomics Unit, Laboratory of Genetics and Genomics, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, Biomedical Research Center, 251 Bayview Boulevard, Baltimore, MD, 21224, United States.', '5 Metabolism Unit, Laboratory of Clinical Investigation, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, Biomedical Research Center, 251 Bayview Boulevard, Baltimore, MD, 21224, United States; Faculty of Pharmacy, Biomedical and Veterinary Sciences, University of Antwerp, 2610, Wilrijk, Belgium.

906,Top-down activation of the visuo-orthographic system during spoken sentence processing,"The left ventral occipitotemporal cortex (vOT) is considered the key area of the visuo-orthographic system. However, some studies reported that the area is also involved in speech processing tasks, especially those that require activation of orthographic knowledge. These findings suggest the existence of a top-down activation mechanism allowing such cross-modal activation. Yet, little is known about the involvement of the vOT in more natural speech processing situations like spoken sentence processing. Here, we addressed this issue in a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) study while manipulating the impacts of two factors, i.e., task demands (semantic vs. low-level perceptual task) and the quality of speech signals (sentences presented against clear vs. noisy background). Analyses were performed at the levels of whole brain and region-of-interest (ROI) focusing on the vOT voxels individually identified through a reading task. Whole brain analysis showed that processing spoken sentences induced activity in a large network including the regions typically involved in phonological, articulatory, semantic and orthographic processing. ROI analysis further specified that a significant part of the vOT voxels that responded to written words also responded to spoken sentences, thus, suggesting that the same area within the left occipitotemporal pathway contributes to both reading and speech processing. Interestingly, both analyses provided converging evidence that vOT responses to speech were sensitive to both task demands and quality of speech signals: Compared to the low-level perceptual task, activity of the area increased when efforts on comprehension were required. The impact of background noise depended on task demands. It led to a decrease of vOT activity in the semantic task but not in the low-level perceptual task. Our results provide new insights into the function of this key area of the reading network, notably by showing that its speech-induced top-down activation also generalizes to ecological speech processing situations.","['1 Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, LPL, Aix-en-Provence, France; INSERM-CEA, Cognitive Neuroimaging Unit, Neurospin Center, Gif-sur-Yvette, France.

907,Topic Modeling of Social Networking Service Data on Occupational Accidents in Korea: Latent Dirichlet Allocation Analysis,"Background:
      
    

    
      In most industrialized societies, regulations, inspections, insurance, and legal options are established to support workers who suffer injury, disease, or death in relation to their work; in practice, these resources are imperfect or even unavailable due to workplace or employer obstruction. Thus, limitations exist to identify unmet needs in occupational safety and health information. Objective:
      
    

    
      The aim of this study was to explore hidden issues related to occupational accidents by examining social network services (SNS) data using topic modeling. Methods:
      
    

    
      Based on the results of a Google search for the phrases occupational accident, industrial accident and occupational diseases, a total of 145 websites were selected. From among these websites, we collected 15,244 documents on queries related to occupational accidents between 2002 and 2018. To transform unstructured text into structure data, natural language processing of the Korean language was conducted. We performed the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) as a topic model using a Python library. A time-series linear regression analysis was also conducted to identify yearly trends for the given documents. Results:
      
    

    
      The results of the LDA model showed 14 topics with 3 themes: workers' compensation benefits (Theme 1), illicit agreements with the employer (Theme 2), and fatal and non-fatal injuries and vulnerable workers (Theme 3). Theme 1 represented the largest cluster (52.2%) of the collected documents and included keywords related to workers' compensation (ie, company, occupational injury, insurance, accident, approval, and compensation) and keywords describing specific compensation benefits such as medical expense benefits, temporary incapacity benefits, and disability benefits. In the yearly trend, Theme 1 gradually decreased; however, other themes showed an overall increasing pattern. Certain queries (ie, musculoskeletal system, critical care, and foreign workers) showed no significant variation in the number of queries. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We conducted LDA analysis of SNS data of occupational accident-related queries and discovered that the primary concerns of workers posting about occupational injuries and diseases were workers' compensation benefits, fatal and non-fatal injuries, vulnerable workers, and illicit agreements with employers. While traditional systems focus mainly on quantitative monitoring of occupational accidents, qualitative aspects formulated by topic modeling from unstructured SNS queries may be valuable to address inequalities and improve occupational health and safety.","['1 College of Medicine, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', '2 Institute of Health and Environment, Seoul National University School of Public Health, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']","Kyoung-Bok Min, Sung-Hee Song, Jin-Young Min, ",Journal of medical Internet research,2020,accident; analysis; knowledge; model; occupational accident; safety; social media; topic modeling; workplace.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32663156
908,Language processing from the perspective of electrical stimulation mapping,"Electrical Stimulation (ES) is a neurostimulation technique that is used to localize language functions in the brain of people with intractable epilepsy and/or brain tumors. We reviewed 25 ES articles published between 1984 and 2018 and interpreted them from a cognitive neuropsychological perspective. Our aim was to highlight ES as a tool to further our understanding of cognitive models of language. We focused on associations and dissociations between cognitive functions within the framework of two non-neuroanatomically specified models of language. Also, we discussed parallels between the ES and the stroke literatures and showed how ES data can help us to generate hypotheses regarding how language is processed. A good understanding of cognitive models of language is essential to motivate task selection and to tailor surgical procedures, for example, by avoiding testing the same cognitive functions and understanding which functions may be more or less relevant to be tested during surgery.","['1 Global Brain Health Institute, Trinity College Dublin , Dublin , Ireland.', '2 Department of Cognitive Science, Johns Hopkins University , Baltimore , MD , USA.', '3 Department of Neurosurgery, Lariboisière Hospital , Paris , France.', '4 University Diderot Paris 7 , Paris , France.', '5 Frontlab, INSERM, ICM , Paris , France.', '6 Department of Neurology, Johns Hopkins University , Baltimore , MD , USA.', '7 Center for Mind and Brain Sciences, University of Trento , Trento , Italy.']","Adrià Rofes, Emmanuel Mandonnet, Vânia de Aguiar, Brenda Rapp, Kyrana Tsapkini, Gabriele Miceli, ",Cognitive neuropsychology,May-Jun 2019,Awake surgery; cognitive neuroscience; direct electrical stimulation; language.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29996708
909,Natural language processing for disease phenotyping in UK primary care records for research: a pilot study in myocardial infarction and death,"Background:
      
    

    
      Free text in electronic health records (EHR) may contain additional phenotypic information beyond structured (coded) information. For major health events - heart attack and death - there is a lack of studies evaluating the extent to which free text in the primary care record might add information. Our objectives were to describe the contribution of free text in primary care to the recording of information about myocardial infarction (MI), including subtype, left ventricular function, laboratory results and symptoms; and recording of cause of death. We used the CALIBER EHR research platform which contains primary care data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) linked to hospital admission data, the MINAP registry of acute coronary syndromes and the death registry. In CALIBER we randomly selected 2000 patients with MI and 1800 deaths. We implemented a rule-based natural language engine, the Freetext Matching Algorithm, on site at CPRD to analyse free text in the primary care record without raw data being released to researchers. We analysed text recorded within 90 days before or 90 days after the MI, and on or after the date of death. Results:
      
    

    
      We extracted 10,927 diagnoses, 3658 test results, 3313 statements of negation, and 850 suspected diagnoses from the myocardial infarction patients. Inclusion of free text increased the recorded proportion of patients with chest pain in the week prior to MI from 19 to 27%, and differentiated between MI subtypes in a quarter more patients than structured data alone. Cause of death was incompletely recorded in primary care; in 36% the cause was in coded data and in 21% it was in free text. Only 47% of patients had exactly the same cause of death in primary care and the death registry, but this did not differ between coded and free text causes of death. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Among patients who suffer MI or die, unstructured free text in primary care records contains much information that is potentially useful for research such as symptoms, investigation results and specific diagnoses. Access to large scale unstructured data in electronic health records (millions of patients) might yield important insights.","['1 Health Data Research UK London, University College London, 222 Euston Road, London, NW1 2DA, UK. anoop@doctors.org.uk.', '2 Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, 222 Euston Road, London, NW1 2DA, UK. anoop@doctors.org.uk.', '3 The National Institute for Health Research University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre, University College London, 222 Euston Road, London, NW1 2DA, UK. anoop@doctors.org.uk.', '4 University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, 235 Euston Road, London, NW1 2BU, UK. anoop@doctors.org.uk.', '5 University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, 235 Euston Road, London, NW1 2BU, UK.', '6 Clinical Practice Research Datalink, Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, 10 South Colonnade, London, E14 4PU, UK.', '7 Health Data Research UK London, University College London, 222 Euston Road, London, NW1 2DA, UK.', '8 Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, 222 Euston Road, London, NW1 2DA, UK.', '9 The National Institute for Health Research University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre, University College London, 222 Euston Road, London, NW1 2DA, UK.', ""10 Department of Biostatistics and Health Informatics, King's College London, De Crespigny Park, Denmark Hill, London, SE5 8AF, UK.""]","Anoop D Shah, Emily Bailey, Tim Williams, Spiros Denaxas, Richard Dobson, Harry Hemingway, ",Journal of biomedical semantics,2019,Chest pain; Free text; Myocardial infarction; Natural language processing; Primary care.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31711543
910,Competencies for Professionals in Health Economics and Outcomes Research: The ISPOR Health Economics and Outcomes Research Competencies Framework,"The need for Health Economics and Outcomes Research (HEOR) has expanded globally, fueling demand for professionals trained in the discipline. By leveraging the expertise and perspectives of its members, the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) established a set of competencies for HEOR professionals. The resulting 41 competencies were organized into 13 topic domains that collectively comprise the ISPOR Health Economics and Outcomes Research Competencies Framework. In this article, we explain the collaborative process used by the ISPOR Institutional Council and Faculty Advisor Council to identify and validate the framework. This process entailed expertise from the council members combined with natural language processing to examine competencies included in ISPOR Career Center HEOR job postings, qualitative input from a focused Institutional Council-Faculty Advisor Council workgroup, and quantitative input from 3 surveys of mutually exclusive member groups: a general member survey to assess importance and relevance of each competency, a faculty member survey to assess the extent to which HEOR graduate degree programs cover each of the competencies, and a student member survey to assess exposure to each of the competencies. Organization of the competencies into topic domains was achieved by engaging the Education Council, which applied a taxonomy consistent with ISPOR's educational programming. The resulting ISPOR Health Economics and Outcomes Research Competencies Framework has the important potential of serving as a tool to guide academic curricula, fellowships, and continuing education programs, and assessment of job candidates. As the HEOR field advances, so do the job types and the breadth of topics in which professionals must demonstrate competence. Future work will entail revisiting the competencies to ensure their currency and comprehensiveness, and tailoring the framework according to major specialty areas.","['1 Center for Health Outcomes, Policy, and Economics, Rutgers University Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy, Piscataway, NJ, USA.

This work has revealed a system of composition that involves rapidly peaking activity in the left anterior temporal lobe and later engagement of the medial prefrontal cortex. Both brain regions show evidence of shared processing between comprehension and production, as well as between spoken and signed language. Both appear to compute meaning, not syntactic structure.

      The goal of the 2018 n2c2 shared task on cohort selection for clinical trials (track 1) is to identify which patients meet the selection criteria for clinical trials. Cohort selection is a particularly demanding task to which natural language processing and deep learning can make a valuable contribution. Our goal is to evaluate several deep learning architectures to deal with this task. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      Cohort selection can be formulated as a multilabeling problem whose goal is to determine which criteria are met for each patient record. We explore several deep learning architectures such as a simple convolutional neural network (CNN), a deep CNN, a recurrent neural network (RNN), and CNN-RNN hybrid architecture. Although our architectures are similar to those proposed in existing deep learning systems for text classification, our research also studies the impact of using a fully connected feedforward layer on the performance of these architectures. Results:
      
    

    
      The RNN and hybrid models provide the best results, though without statistical significance. The use of the fully connected feedforward layer improves the results for all the architectures, except for the hybrid architecture. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Despite the limited size of the dataset, deep learning methods show promising results in learning useful features for the task of cohort selection. Therefore, they can be used as a previous filter for cohort selection for any clinical trial with a minimum of human intervention, thus reducing the cost and time of clinical trials significantly.","['1 Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Leganés, Spain.']","Isabel Segura-Bedmar, Pablo Raez, ",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2019,cohort selection; convolutional neural network; deep learning; multilabel text classification; recurrent neural network.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31532478

This last step requires an adaptability of the electronic health records to integrate learning health system tools. In this literature review, we examine the research that provides solutions to unlock these barriers and accelerate translational research: structured electronic health records and free-text search engines to find patients, data warehouses and natural language processing to extract phenotypes, machine learning algorithms to classify patients, and similarity metrics to diagnose patients. Medical informatics is experiencing an impellent request to develop decision support systems, and this requires ethical considerations for clinicians and patients to ensure appropriate use of health data.","['1 Inserm U1163, Imagine Institute, Paris Center University, Paris, France; Inserm, Cordeliers Research Center, U1138, eq 22, Paris Descartes University, Sorbonne Paris-Cite, Paris, France.

915,Merge-Generability as the Key Concept of Human Language: Evidence From Neuroscience,"Ever since the inception of generative linguistics, various dependency patterns have been widely discussed in the literature, particularly as they pertain to the hierarchy based on ""weak generation"" - the so-called Chomsky Hierarchy. However, humans can make any possible dependency patterns by using artificial means on a sequence of symbols (e.g., computer programing). The differences between sentences in human language and general symbol sequences have been routinely observed, but the question as to why such differences exist has barely been raised. Here, we address this problem and propose a theoretical explanation in terms of a new concept of ""Merge-generability,"" that is, whether the structural basis for a given dependency is provided by the fundamental operation Merge. In our functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we tested the judgments of noun phrase (NP)-predicate (Pred) pairings in sentences of Japanese, an SOV language that allows natural, unbounded nesting configurations. We further introduced two pseudo-adverbs, which artificially force dependencies that do not conform to structures generated by Merge, i.e., non-Merge-generable; these adverbs enable us to manipulate Merge-generability (Natural or Artificial). By employing this novel paradigm, we obtained the following results. Firstly, the behavioral data clearly showed that an NP-Pred matching task became more demanding under the Artificial conditions than under the Natural conditions, reflecting cognitive loads that could be covaried with the increased number of words. Secondly, localized activation in the left frontal cortex, as well as in the left middle temporal gyrus and angular gyrus, was observed for the [Natural - Artificial] contrast, indicating specialization of these left regions in syntactic processing. Any activation due to task difficulty was completely excluded from activations in these regions, because the Natural conditions were always easier than the Artificial ones. And finally, the [Artificial - Natural] contrast resulted in the dorsal portion of the left frontal cortex, together with wide-spread regions required for general cognitive demands. These results indicate that Merge-generable sentences are processed in these specific regions in contrast to non-Merge-generable sentences, demonstrating that Merge is indeed a fundamental operation, which comes into play especially under the Natural conditions.","['1 Department of Basic Science, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', '2 Department of English Language and Literature, Faculty of Letters, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', '3 Department of Linguistics, Faculty of Humanities, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', '4 Graduate School of Languages and Linguistics, Sophia University, Tokyo, Japan.', '5 Faculty of Foreign Languages, Kanagawa University, Yokohama, Japan.', '6 Department of English, Faculty of Letters, Tokai University, Hiratsuka, Japan.']","Kyohei Tanaka, Isso Nakamura, Shinri Ohta, Naoki Fukui, Mihoko Zushi, Hiroki Narita, Kuniyoshi L Sakai, ",Frontiers in psychology,2019,Chomsky Hierarchy; Merge; Merge-generability; fMRI; inferior frontal gyrus; lateral premotor cortex; syntax.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31849777
916,Early Identification of Childhood Asthma: The Role of Informatics in an Era of Electronic Health Records,"Emerging literature suggests that delayed identification of childhood asthma results in an increased risk of long-term and various morbidities compared to those with timely diagnosis and intervention, and yet this risk is still overlooked. Even when children and adolescents have a history of recurrent asthma-like symptoms and risk factors embedded in their medical records, this information is sometimes overlooked by clinicians at the point of care. Given the rapid adoption of electronic health record (EHR) systems, early identification of childhood asthma can be achieved utilizing (1) asthma ascertainment criteria leveraging relevant clinical information embedded in EHR and (2) innovative informatics approaches such as natural language processing (NLP) algorithms for asthma ascertainment criteria to enable such a strategy. In this review, we discuss literature relevant to this topic and introduce recently published informatics algorithms (criteria-based NLP) as a potential solution to address the current challenge of early identification of childhood asthma.","['1 Department of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States.', '2 Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States.', '3 Division of Allergic Diseases, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States.', '4 Department of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine and Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States.']","Hee Yun Seol, Sunghwan Sohn, Hongfang Liu, Chung-Il Wi, Euijung Ryu, Miguel A Park, Young J Juhn, ",Frontiers in pediatrics,2019,EHR; asthma; children; early; identification; informatics.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31001500
917,Use of Complementary and Integrated Health: A Retrospective Analysis of U.S. Veterans with Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain Nationally,"Objective:
      
    

    
      To partially address the opioid crisis, some complementary and integrative health (CIH) therapies are now recommended for chronic musculoskeletal pain, a common condition presented in primary care. As such, health care systems are increasingly offering CIH therapies, and the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the nation's largest integrated health care system, has been at the forefront of this movement. However, little is known about the uptake of CIH among patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. As such, we conducted the first study of the use of a variety of nonherbal CIH therapies among a large patient population having chronic musculoskeletal pain. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      We examined the frequency and predictors of CIH therapy use using administrative data for a large retrospective cohort of younger veterans with chronic musculoskeletal pain using the VHA between 2010 and 2013 (n = 530,216). We conducted a 2-year effort to determine use of nine types of CIH by using both natural language processing data mining methods and administrative and CPT4 codes. We defined chronic musculoskeletal pain as: (1) having 2+ visits with musculoskeletal diagnosis codes likely to represent chronic pain separated by 30-365 days or (2) 2+ visits with musculoskeletal diagnosis codes within 90 days and with 2+ numeric rating scale pain scores ≥4 at 2+ visits within 90 days. Results:
      
    

    
      More than a quarter (27%) of younger veterans with chronic musculoskeletal pain used any CIH therapy, 15% used meditation, 7% yoga, 6% acupuncture, 5% chiropractic, 4% guided imagery, 3% biofeedback, 2% t'ai chi, 2% massage, and 0.2% hypnosis. Use of any CIH therapy was more likely among women, single patients, patients with three of the six pain conditions, or patients with any of the six pain comorbid conditions. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Patients appear willing to use CIH approaches, given that 27% used some type. However, low rates of some specific CIH suggest the potential to augment CIH use.","['1 1 Center for the Study of Healthcare Innovation, Implementation and Policy, VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System, Los Angeles, CA.', '2 2 Department of Health Policy and Management, UCLA School of Public Health, Los Angeles, CA.', '3 3 RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, CA.', '4 4 Center for the Study of Innovation to Implementation, VA Palo Alto Health Care System, Menlo Park, CA.', '5 5 Center for Health and Aging, VA Washington DC Health Care System, Washington, DC.', '6 6 Biomedical Informatics Center, George Washington University, Washington, DC.', '7 7 Informatics Department, VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System, Los Angeles, CA.']","Stephanie L Taylor, Patricia M Herman, Nell J Marshall, Qing Zeng, Anita Yuan, Karen Chu, Yijun Shao, Craig Morioka, Karl A Lorenz, ","Journal of alternative and complementary medicine (New York, N.Y.)",2019 Jan,alternative medicine; chronic pain; musculoskeletal pain; veterans.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30312109
918,Paired Trial Classification: A Novel Deep Learning Technique for MVPA,"Many recent developments in machine learning have come from the field of ""deep learning,"" or the use of advanced neural network architectures and techniques. While these methods have produced state-of-the-art results and dominated research focus in many fields, such as image classification and natural language processing, they have not gained as much ground over standard multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) techniques in the classification of electroencephalography (EEG) or other human neuroscience datasets. The high dimensionality and large amounts of noise present in EEG data, coupled with the relatively low number of examples (trials) that can be reasonably obtained from a sample of human subjects, lead to difficulty training deep learning models. Even when a model successfully converges in training, significant overfitting can occur despite the presence of regularization techniques. To help alleviate these problems, we present a new method of ""paired trial classification"" that involves classifying pairs of EEG recordings as coming from the same class or different classes. This allows us to drastically increase the number of training examples, in a manner akin to but distinct from traditional data augmentation approaches, through the combinatorics of pairing trials. Moreover, paired trial classification still allows us to determine the true class of a novel example (trial) via a ""dictionary"" approach: compare the novel example to a group of known examples from each class, and determine the final class via summing the same/different decision values within each class. Since individual trials are noisy, this approach can be further improved by comparing a novel individual example with a ""dictionary"" in which each entry is an average of several examples (trials). Even further improvements can be realized in situations where multiple samples from a single unknown class can be averaged, thus permitting averaged signals to be compared with averaged signals.","['1 Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, NE, United States.', '2 Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, NE, United States.', '3 Department of Psychology, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, NE, United States.']","Jacob M Williams, Ashok Samal, Prahalada K Rao, Matthew R Johnson, ",Frontiers in neuroscience,2020,EEG; MVPA; cognitive neuroscience; deep learning; machine learning.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32425753

921,The Neurocognition of Developmental Disorders of Language,"Developmental disorders of language include developmental language disorder, dyslexia, and motor-speech disorders such as articulation disorder and stuttering. These disorders have generally been explained by accounts that focus on their behavioral rather than neural characteristics; their processing rather than learning impairments; and each disorder separately rather than together, despite their commonalities and comorbidities. Here we update and review a unifying neurocognitive account-the Procedural circuit Deficit Hypothesis (PDH). The PDH posits that abnormalities of brain structures underlying procedural memory (learning and memory that rely on the basal ganglia and associated circuitry) can explain numerous brain and behavioral characteristics across learning and processing, in multiple disorders, including both commonalities and differences. We describe procedural memory, examine its role in various aspects of language, and then present the PDH and relevant evidence across language-related disorders. The PDH has substantial explanatory power, and both basic research and translational implications.","['1 Brain and Language Lab, Department of Neuroscience, Georgetown University, Washington, DC 20057, USA; email: michael@georgetown.edu.', '2 Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders, University of Delaware, Newark, Delaware 19713, USA.', '3 Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois 60208, USA.', '4 Institute of Psychology, Eotvos Lorand University (ELTE), H-1071 Budapest, Hungary.', '5 Brain, Memory, and Language Lab; Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience and Psychology, Research Centre for Natural Sciences, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary.']","Michael T Ullman, F Sayako Earle, Matthew Walenski, Karolina Janacsek, ",Annual review of psychology,2020,articulation disorder; basal ganglia; childhood apraxia of speech; declarative memory; developmental language disorder; dyslexia; procedural circuit deficit hypothesis; procedural memory; specific language impairment; stuttering.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31337273
922,Assessing Public Opinion on CRISPR-Cas9: Combining Crowdsourcing and Deep Learning,"Background:
      
    

    
      The discovery of the CRISPR-Cas9-based gene editing method has opened unprecedented new potential for biological and medical engineering, sparking a growing public debate on both the potential and dangers of CRISPR applications. Given the speed of technology development and the almost instantaneous global spread of news, it is important to follow evolving debates without much delay and in sufficient detail, as certain events may have a major long-term impact on public opinion and later influence policy decisions. Objective:
      
    

    
      Social media networks such as Twitter have shown to be major drivers of news dissemination and public discourse. They provide a vast amount of semistructured data in almost real-time and give direct access to the content of the conversations. We can now mine and analyze such data quickly because of recent developments in machine learning and natural language processing. Methods:
      
    

    
      Here, we used Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), an attention-based transformer model, in combination with statistical methods to analyze the entirety of all tweets ever published on CRISPR since the publication of the first gene editing application in 2013. Results:
      
    

    
      We show that the mean sentiment of tweets was initially very positive, but began to decrease over time, and that this decline was driven by rare peaks of strong negative sentiments. Due to the high temporal resolution of the data, we were able to associate these peaks with specific events and to observe how trending topics changed over time. Conclusions:

923,Cross-registry neural domain adaptation to extract mutational test results from pathology reports,"Objective:
      
    

    
      We study the performance of machine learning (ML) methods, including neural networks (NNs), to extract mutational test results from pathology reports collected by cancer registries. Given the lack of hand-labeled datasets for mutational test result extraction, we focus on the particular use-case of extracting Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor mutation results in non-small cell lung cancers. We explore the generalization of NNs across different registries where our goals are twofold: (1) to assess how well models trained on a registry's data port to test data from a different registry and (2) to assess whether and to what extent such models can be improved using state-of-the-art neural domain adaptation techniques under different assumptions about what is available (labeled vs unlabeled data) at the target registry site. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      We collected data from two registries: the Kentucky Cancer Registry (KCR) and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FH) Cancer Surveillance System. We combine NNs with adversarial domain adaptation to improve cross-registry performance. We compare to other classifiers in the standard supervised classification, unsupervised domain adaptation, and supervised domain adaptation scenarios. Results:
      
    

    
      The performance of ML methods varied between registries. To extract positive results, the basic convolutional neural network (CNN) had an F1 of 71.5% on the KCR dataset and 95.7% on the FH dataset. For the KCR dataset, the CNN F1 results were low when trained on FH data (Positive F1: 23%). Using our proposed adversarial CNN, without any labeled data, we match the F1 of the models trained directly on each target registry's data. The adversarial CNN F1 improved when trained on FH and applied to KCR dataset (Positive F1: 70.8%). We found similar performance improvements when we trained on KCR and tested on FH reports (Positive F1: 45% to 96%). Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Adversarial domain adaptation improves the performance of NNs applied to pathology reports. In the unsupervised domain adaptation setting, we match the performance of models that are trained directly on target registry's data by using source registry's labeled data and unlabeled examples from the target registry.","['1 Department of Information Systems and Cyber Security, University of Texas at San Antonio, USA.', '2 Division of Biomedical Informatics, Dept. of Internal Medicine, University of Kentucky, USA; Kentucky Cancer Registry, Lexington, KY, USA.', '3 Kentucky Cancer Registry, Lexington, KY, USA.', '4 Markey Cancer Center, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA.', '5 Ironwood Cancer and Research Centers, Avondale, AZ, USA.', '6 Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', '7 Division of Biomedical Informatics, Dept. of Internal Medicine, University of Kentucky, USA; Computer Science Department, University of Kentucky, USA.

However, few thorough studies on text mining and application development, for plant molecular biology data, have been performed, especially for rice, resulting in a lack of datasets available to solve named-entity recognition tasks for this species. Since there are rare benchmarks available for rice, we faced various difficulties in exploiting advanced machine learning methods for accurate analysis of the rice literature. To evaluate several approaches to automatically extract information from gene/protein entities, we built a new dataset for rice as a benchmark. This dataset is composed of a set of titles and abstracts, extracted from scientific papers focusing on the rice species, and is downloaded from PubMed. During the 5th Biomedical Linked Annotation Hackathon, a portion of the dataset was uploaded to PubAnnotation for sharing.

925,"EBM+: Advancing Evidence-Based Medicine via two level automatic identification of Populations, Interventions, Outcomes in medical literature","Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) has been an important practice for medical practitioners. However, as the number of medical publications increases dramatically, it is becoming extremely difficult for medical experts to review all the contents available and make an informative treatment plan for their patients. A variety of frameworks, including the PICO framework which is named after its elements (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome), have been developed to enable fine-grained searches, as the first step to faster decision making. In this work, we propose a novel entity recognition system that identifies PICO entities within medical publications and achieves state-of-the-art performance in the task. This is achieved by the combination of four 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for character feature extraction, and a Highway Residual connection to facilitate deep Neural Network architectures. We further introduce a PICO Statement classifier, that identifies sentences that not only contain all PICO entities but also answer questions stated in PICO. To facilitate this task we also introduce a high quality dataset, manually annotated by medical practitioners. With the combination of our proposed PICO Entity Recognizer and PICO Statement classifier we aim to advance EBM and enable its faster and more accurate practice.","['1 School of Informatics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece.

926,A Qualitative Evaluation of Language Models on Automatic Question-Answering for COVID-19,"COVID-19 has resulted in an ongoing pandemic and as of 12 June 2020, has caused more than 7.4 million cases and over 418,000 deaths. The highly dynamic and rapidly evolving situation with COVID-19 has made it difficult to access accurate, on-demand information regarding the disease. Online communities, forums, and social media provide potential venues to search for relevant questions and answers, or post questions and seek answers from other members. However, due to the nature of such sites, there are always a limited number of relevant questions and responses to search from, and posted questions are rarely answered immediately. With the advancements in the field of natural language processing, particularly in the domain of language models, it has become possible to design chatbots that can automatically answer consumer questions. However, such models are rarely applied and evaluated in the healthcare domain, to meet the information needs with accurate and up-to-date healthcare data. In this paper, we propose to apply a language model for automatically answering questions related to COVID-19 and qualitatively evaluate the generated responses. We utilized the GPT-2 language model and applied transfer learning to retrain it on the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) corpus. In order to improve the quality of the generated responses, we applied 4 different approaches, namely tf-idf, BERT, BioBERT, and USE to filter and retain relevant sentences in the responses. In the performance evaluation step, we asked two medical experts to rate the responses. We found that BERT and BioBERT, on average, outperform both tf-idf and USE in relevance-based sentence filtering tasks.

927,IDP-Seq2Seq: Identification of Intrinsically Disordered Regions based on Sequence to Sequence Learning,"Motivation:
      
    

    
      Related to many important biological functions, intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are widely distributed in proteins. Accurate prediction of intrinsically disordered regions is critical for the protein structure and function analysis. However, the existing computational methods construct the predictive models solely in the sequence space, failing to convert the sequence space into the ""semantic space"" to reflect the structure characteristics of proteins. Furthermore, although the length-dependent predictors showed promising results, new fusion strategies should be explored to improve their predictive performance and the generalization. Results:
      
    

    
      In this study, we applied the Sequence to Sequence Learning (Seq2Seq) derived from natural language processing (NLP) to map protein sequences to ""semantic space"" to reflect the structure patterns with the help of predicted Residue-Residue Contacts (CCMs) and other sequence-based features. Furthermore, the Attention mechanism was employed to capture the global associations between all residue pairs in the proteins. Three length-dependent predictors were constructed: IDP-Seq2Seq-L for long disordered region prediction, IDP-Seq2Seq-S for short disordered region prediction, and IDP-Seq2Seq-G for both long and short disordered region prediction. Finally, these three predictors were fused into one predictor called IDP-Seq2Seq to improve the discriminative power and generalization. Experimental results on four independent test datasets and the CASP test dataset showed that IDP-Seq2Seq is insensitive with the ratios of long and short disordered regions and outperforms other competing methods.

      For the convenience of most experimental scientists, a user-friendly and publicly accessible web-server for the powerful new predictor has been established at http://bliulab.net/IDP-Seq2Seq/.

928,Key Considerations for Incorporating Conversational AI in Psychotherapy,"Conversational artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the way mental health care is delivered. By gathering diagnostic information, facilitating treatment, and reviewing clinician behavior, conversational AI is poised to impact traditional approaches to delivering psychotherapy. While this transition is not disconnected from existing professional services, specific formulations of clinician-AI collaboration and migration paths between forms remain vague. In this viewpoint, we introduce four approaches to AI-human integration in mental health service delivery. To inform future research and policy, these four approaches are addressed through four dimensions of impact: access to care, quality, clinician-patient relationship, and patient self-disclosure and sharing. Although many research questions are yet to be investigated, we view safety, trust, and oversight as crucial first steps. If conversational AI isn't safe it should not be used, and if it isn't trusted, it won't be. In order to assess safety, trust, interfaces, procedures, and system level workflows, oversight and collaboration is needed between AI systems, patients, clinicians, and administrators.","['1 Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, United States.', '2 Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, United States.', '3 Department of Communication, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States.', '4 Stanford Center for Biomedical Informatics Research, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, United States.']","Adam S Miner, Nigam Shah, Kim D Bullock, Bruce A Arnow, Jeremy Bailenson, Jeff Hancock, ",Frontiers in psychiatry,2019,artificial intelligence; chatbot; conversational AI; digital assistant; expert systems; human–computer interaction; natural language processing; psychotherapy.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31681047
929,Waiting time information in the Italian NHS: A citizen perspective,"Public involvement in the management and communication of waiting times is known to support initiatives to reduce waiting times, as well as increase fairness and promote transparency and accountability. In order to improve transparency and communication to citizens, Italy recently updated the National Regulatory Plan for Waiting Lists (2019-2021), which calls for the disclosure of waiting time information on healthcare provider webpages. This study analyses waiting time information for outpatient visits and digital services available on the institutional website pages of 144 public healthcare organisations in nine regions and two autonomous provinces of Italy. Web pages were analysed both in terms of the available information/services, using a grid, and in terms of the quality of the text using an advanced readability assessment tool (READ-IT). This information was complemented and validated by regional healthcare key informants during research-specific workshops.

930,Story Arcs in Serious Illness: Natural Language Processing features of Palliative Care Conversations,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Serious illness conversations are complex clinical narratives that remain poorly understood. Natural Language Processing (NLP) offers new approaches for identifying hidden patterns within the lexicon of stories that may reveal insights about the taxonomy of serious illness conversations. Methods:
      
    

    
      We analyzed verbatim transcripts from 354 consultations involving 231 patients and 45 palliative care clinicians from the Palliative Care Communication Research Initiative. We stratified each conversation into deciles of ""narrative time"" based on word counts. We used standard NLP analyses to examine the frequency and distribution of words and phrases indicating temporal reference, illness terminology, sentiment and modal verbs (indicating possibility/desirability). Results:
      
    

    
      Temporal references shifted steadily from talking about the past to talking about the future over deciles of narrative time. Conversations progressed incrementally from ""sadder"" to ""happier"" lexicon; reduction in illness terminology accounted substantially for this pattern. We observed the following sequence in peak frequency over narrative time: symptom terms, treatment terms, prognosis terms and modal verbs indicating possibility. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      NLP methods can identify narrative arcs in serious illness conversations. Practice implications:
      
    

    
      Fully automating NLP methods will allow for efficient, large scale and real time measurement of serious illness conversations for research, education and system re-design.","['1 University of Vermont, Burlington, VT, USA.', '2 Department of Mathematics, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT, USA.', '3 Department of Computer Science, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT, USA.', '4 Department of Civil Engineering, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT, USA.', '5 Department of Family Medicine, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT, USA.

932,Expert Event Segmentation of Dance Is Genre-Specific and Primes Verbal Memory,"By chunking continuous streams of action into ordered, discrete, and meaningful units, event segmentation facilitates motor learning. While expertise in the observed repertoire reduces the frequency of event borders, generalization of this effect to unfamiliar genres of dance and among other sensorimotor experts (musicians, athletes) remains unknown, and was the first aim of this study. Due to significant overlap in visuomotor, language, and memory processing brain networks, the second aim of this study was to investigate whether visually priming expert motor schemas improves memory for words related to one's expertise. A total of 112 participants in six groups (ballet, Bharatanatyam, and ""other"" dancers, athletes, musicians, and non-experts) segmented a ballet dance, a Bharatanatyam dance, and a non-dance control sequence. To test verbal memory, participants performed a retrieval-induced forgetting task between segmentation blocks. Dance, instrument, and sport word categories were included to probe the second study aim. Results of the event segmentation paradigm clarify that previously-established expert segmentation effects are specific to familiar genres of dance, and do not transfer between different types of experts or to non-dance sequences. Greater recall of dance category words among ballet and Bharatanatyam dancers provides novel evidence for improved verbal memory primed by activating familiar sensorimotor representations.","['1 Department of Psychology, York University, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.', '2 Centre for Vision Research, York University, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.', '3 Neuroscience Graduate Diploma Program, York University, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.', '4 Graduate Program in Interdisciplinary Studies, York University, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.']","Paula M Di Nota, Michael P Olshansky, Joseph F X DeSouza, ","Vision (Basel, Switzerland)",2020,action observation; cognition; dance; event segmentation; expertise; priming; verbal memory; visuomotor processing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32785006

934,A Gestalt inference model for auditory scene segregation,"Our current understanding of how the brain segregates auditory scenes into meaningful objects is in line with a Gestaltism framework. These Gestalt principles suggest a theory of how different attributes of the soundscape are extracted then bound together into separate groups that reflect different objects or streams present in the scene. These cues are thought to reflect the underlying statistical structure of natural sounds in a similar way that statistics of natural images are closely linked to the principles that guide figure-ground segregation and object segmentation in vision. In the present study, we leverage inference in stochastic neural networks to learn emergent grouping cues directly from natural soundscapes including speech, music and sounds in nature. The model learns a hierarchy of local and global spectro-temporal attributes reminiscent of simultaneous and sequential Gestalt cues that underlie the organization of auditory scenes. These mappings operate at multiple time scales to analyze an incoming complex scene and are then fused using a Hebbian network that binds together coherent features into perceptually-segregated auditory objects. The proposed architecture successfully emulates a wide range of well established auditory scene segregation phenomena and quantifies the complimentary role of segregation and binding cues in driving auditory scene segregation.","['1 Laboratory for Computational Audio Processing, Center for Speech and Language Processing, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.']","Debmalya Chakrabarty, Mounya Elhilali, ",PLoS computational biology,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30668568
935,Improving Reading in Adolescents and Adults With High-Functioning Autism Through an Assistive Technology Tool: A Cross-Over Multinational Study,"People with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience reading comprehension difficulties, often misinterpreting complex texts, metaphors, and idioms. We have developed and tested a new assistive technology tool for adaptive, personalized text simplification, called Open Book. This tool is an open-sourced, online platform that uses Natural Language Processing with the specific aim of assisting reading and aiding understanding of written text for people with ASD. The accessibility and effectiveness of Open Book was tested by examining the differences in text comprehension scores between the original texts and texts that were simplified by Open Book tool, randomly allocated to study participants. Two hundred forty-three participants (153 adults and 90 adolescents) with high-functioning ASD were recruited in the UK, Spain, and Bulgaria. Regarding the primary outcome, results showed that both adults and adolescents with ASD gave more correct answers for the simplified (M = 11.2, SD = 4.1) than original texts (M = 10, SD = 4.1; p < 0.001). This finding was consistent across age groups and countries. Regarding the secondary outcome, when participants were asked to blindly rate how easy was to understand each text, simplified texts were rated as easier (M = 7.6, SD = 2.4) to understand than the original texts (M = 8.7, SD = 2.6; p < 0.001). The Open Book software seems to have the potential to be a useful tool in assisting reading among people with ASD. Our findings support our primary hypothesis that texts simplified through Open Book were easier to comprehend compared to original texts.","['1 Faculty of Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.', '2 Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom.', '3 Department of Public Health and Epidemiology, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad de los Andes, Santiago, Chile.', '4 Millennium Nucleus to Improve the Mental Health of Adolescents and Youths (Imhay), Santiago, Chile.', '5 Parallel World Association, Plovdiv, Bulgaria.', ""6 Institute of Psychiatry, Neurology and Neurosciences, King's College London, London, United Kingdom."", '7 Neurodevelopmental Services, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom.']","Arlinda Cerga-Pashoja, Jorge Gaete, Antoneta Shishkova, Vesna Jordanova, ",Frontiers in psychiatry,2019,Natural Language Processing; adolescents; adults; autism spectrum disorder; reading.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31447711
936,A framework for space-efficient variable-order Markov models,"Motivation:
      
    

    
      Markov models with contexts of variable length are widely used in bioinformatics for representing sets of sequences with similar biological properties. When models contain many long contexts, existing implementations are either unable to handle genome-scale training datasets within typical memory budgets, or they are optimized for specific model variants and are thus inflexible. Results:
      
    

    
      We provide practical, versatile representations of variable-order Markov models and of interpolated Markov models, that support a large number of context-selection criteria, scoring functions, probability smoothing methods, and interpolations, and that take up to four times less space than previous implementations based on the suffix array, regardless of the number and length of contexts, and up to ten times less space than previous trie-based representations, or more, while matching the size of related, state-of-the-art data structures from Natural Language Processing. We describe how to further compress our indexes to a quantity related to the redundancy of the training data, saving up to 90% of their space on very repetitive datasets, and making them become up to 60 times smaller than previous implementations based on the suffix array. Finally, we show how to exploit constraints on the length and frequency of contexts to further shrink our compressed indexes to half of their size or more, achieving data structures that are a hundred times smaller than previous implementations based on the suffix array, or more. This allows variable-order Markov models to be used with bigger datasets and with longer contexts on the same hardware, thus possibly enabling new applications.

We used subsequent colonoscopy reports to examine how the time to polyp recurrence (731 patients experienced recurrence) is influenced by these characteristics as well as anthropometric features using Kaplan-Meier curves, Cox proportional hazards modeling, and random survival forest models. We found that the rate of recurrence differed significantly by polyp size, number, and location and patient smoking status. Additionally, right-sided colon polyps increased recurrence risk by 30% compared to left-sided polyps. History of tobacco use increased polyp recurrence risk by 20% compared to never-users. A random survival forest model showed an AUC of 0.65 and identified several other predictive variables, which can inform development of personalized polyp surveillance plans.","['1 Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH, USA.', '2 Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH, USA.']","Lia X Harrington, Jason W Wei, Arief A Suriawinata, Todd A Mackenzie, Saeed Hassanpour, ",AMIA Joint Summits on Translational Science proceedings.

939,An exploration strategy improves the diversity of de novo ligands using deep reinforcement learning: a case for the adenosine A 2A receptor,"Over the last 5 years deep learning has progressed tremendously in both image recognition and natural language processing. Now it is increasingly applied to other data rich fields. In drug discovery, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been shown to be an effective method to generate novel chemical structures in the form of SMILES. However, ligands generated by current methods have so far provided relatively low diversity and do not fully cover the whole chemical space occupied by known ligands. Here, we propose a new method (DrugEx) to discover de novo drug-like molecules. DrugEx is an RNN model (generator) trained through reinforcement learning which was integrated with a special exploration strategy. As a case study we applied our method to design ligands against the adenosine A2A receptor. From ChEMBL data, a machine learning model (predictor) was created to predict whether generated molecules are active or not. Based on this predictor as the reward function, the generator was trained by reinforcement learning without any further data. We then compared the performance of our method with two previously published methods, REINVENT and ORGANIC. We found that candidate molecules our model designed, and predicted to be active, had a larger chemical diversity and better covered the chemical space of known ligands compared to the state-of-the-art.","['1 Drug Discovery and Safety, Leiden Academic Centre for Drug Research, Einsteinweg 55, Leiden, The Netherlands.', ""2 Omics and Omics Informatics, Xi'an Jiaotong University, 28 Xianning W Rd, Xi'an, China."", '3 Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, Turnhoutseweg 30, 2340, Beerse, Belgium.', '4 Drug Discovery and Safety, Leiden Academic Centre for Drug Research, Einsteinweg 55, Leiden, The Netherlands. gerard@lacdr.leidenuniv.nl.']","Xuhan Liu, Kai Ye, Herman W T van Vlijmen, Adriaan P IJzerman, Gerard J P van Westen, ",Journal of cheminformatics,2019,Adenosine receptors; Cheminformatics; Deep learning; Exploration strategy; Reinforcement learning.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31127405

Despite using electronic medical records, free narrative text is still widely used for medical records. To make data from texts available for decision support systems, supervised machine learning algorithms might be successfully applied. In this work, we developed and compared a prototype of a medical data extraction system based on different artificial neural network architectures to process free medical texts in the Russian language. Three classifiers were applied to extract entities from snippets of text. Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers showed similar results to all three embedding models. MLP exceeded convolutional network on pipelines that used the embedding model trained on medical records with preliminary lemmatization. Nevertheless, the highest F-score was achieved by CNN. CNN slightly exceeded MLP when the biggest word2vec model was applied (F-score 0.9763).","['1 National Center for Cognitive Technologies, ITMO University, 197101 Saint-Petersburg, Russia.', '2 Institute of Medical Biometry and Informatics, Heidelberg University, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.']","Aleksei Dudchenko, Georgy Kopanitsa, ",International journal of environmental research and public health,2019,data extraction; machine learning; medical records; word embedding.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31717300

943,Understanding Patient Anxieties in the Social Media Era: Qualitative Analysis and Natural Language Processing of an Online Male Infertility Community,"Background:
      
    

    
      Couples struggling with infertility are increasingly turning to the internet for infertility-related content and to connect with others. Most of the published data on infertility and the internet only address the experiences of women, with limited studies focusing exclusively on internet discussions on male factor infertility. Objective:
      
    

    
      The aim of this study was to understand the concerns and experiences of discussants on an online male infertility community and to provide insight into their perceptions of interactions with health care professionals. Methods:
      
    

    
      Using the large-scale data analytics tool BigQuery, we extracted all posts in the r/MaleInfertility community (877 members) of the social media website and discussion board Reddit from November 2017 to October 2018. We performed a qualitative thematic analysis and quantitative semantic analysis using Language Inquiry and Word Count 2015 of the extracted posts to identify dominant themes and subthemes of discussions. Descriptive statistics and semantic analytic Z-scores were computed. Results:
      
    

    
      From the analysis of 97 posts, notable themes and subthemes emerged: 70 (72%) posts shared personal experiences, including feeling emasculated or isolated or describing a negative (28/97, 29%), positive (13/97, 13%), or neutral (56/97, 58%) experience with a health care professional; 19% (18/97) of the posts posed questions about personal semen analysis results. On the basis of semantic analysis, posts by men had higher authenticity scores (Z=3.44; P<.001), suggesting more honest or personal texts, but lower clout scores (Z=4.57; P<.001), suggesting a more tentative or anxious style of writing, compared with posts by women. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      To our knowledge, this study represents the first evaluation of a social media community focused exclusively on male infertility using mixed methodology.

      Comprehensive data on research undertaken in cardiovascular medicine can inform the scientific community and can support policy building. We used the publication output from 2004 to 2013 and the 2014 references to these documents, to identify research topics and trends in the field of cardiovascular disease. Methods and results:
      
    

    
      Text fragments were extracted from the titles and abstracts of 478 000 publications using natural language processing. Through machine-learning algorithms, these text fragments combined to identify specific topics across all publications. A second method, which included cross-references, assigned each publication document to a specific cluster. Experts named the topics and document clusters based on various outputs from these semi-automatic methods. We identified and labelled 175 cardiovascular topics and 20 large document clusters, with concordance between the approaches. Overarching, strongly growing topics in clinical and population sciences are evidence-based guidance for treatment, research on outcomes, prognosis, and risk factors. 'Hot' topics include novel treatments in valve disease and in coronary artery disease, and imaging. Basic research decreases its share over time but sees substantial growth of research on stem cells and tissue engineering, as well as in translational research. Inflammation, biomarkers, metabolic syndrome, obesity, and lipids are hot topics across population, clinical and basic research, supporting integration across the cardiovascular field.

      NSCLC patients treated with lobectomy or SBRT (2005 to 2016) at a single institution were identified. Natural language processing searched data fields within axial surveillance imaging reports for findings suggestive of recurrence. Duration and patterns of institutional surveillance were compared between the 2 groups. Results:
      
    

    
      Three thousand forty-two patients (73.5% lobectomy, 26.5% SBRT) met inclusion criteria. Patients had a longer median duration of surveillance after lobectomy (28.0 months vs SBRT 12.3 months, P < 0.001) and were more likely to undergo histopathological evaluation of clinically suspected relapse (206/274 [75.2%] vs SBRT 54/113 [47.8%], P < 0.001). Patients with clinical suspicion of recurrence had longer durations of institutional surveillance than those who did not among both cohorts (lobectomy 44.4 months vs 25.9, P < 0.001; SBRT 27.9 vs 10.3, P < 0.001). Landmark analyses at 1 and 3 years after therapy identified associations between receipt of lobectomy and ongoing surveillance at each time point (1 year odds ratio [OR] 2.10, P < 0.001; 3 years OR 1.71, P < 0.001) among all patients and those with documented stage I disease. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We identified potential heterogeneity in institutional surveillance patterns after treatment of NSCLC with 2 therapeutic modalities. As less-invasive treatment options for operable patients expand, it will be critical to implement rigorous surveillance paradigms across all modalities.","['1 4002 Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', '2 Department of Diagnostic Radiology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', '3 Department of Radiation Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']","Kyle G Mitchell, David B Nelson, Erin M Corsini, Arlene M Correa, Jeremy J Erasmus, Wayne L Hofstetter, Reza J Mehran, Jack A Roth, Stephen G Swisher, Boris Sepesi, Garrett L Walsh, Ara A Vaporciyan, David C Rice, Quynh-Nhu Nguyen, Mara B Antonoff, ","Innovations (Philadelphia, Pa.)",Jan/Feb 2020,lobectomy; non-small-cell lung cancer; stereotactic body radiotherapy; surgical resection; surveillance.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31875755
948,Generating contextual embeddings for emergency department chief complaints,"Objective:
      
    

    
      We learn contextual embeddings for emergency department (ED) chief complaints using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), a state-of-the-art language model, to derive a compact and computationally useful representation for free-text chief complaints. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      Retrospective data on 2.1 million adult and pediatric ED visits was obtained from a large healthcare system covering the period of March 2013 to July 2019. A total of 355 497 (16.4%) visits from 65 737 (8.9%) patients were removed for absence of either a structured or unstructured chief complaint. To ensure adequate training set size, chief complaint labels that comprised less than 0.01%, or 1 in 10 000, of all visits were excluded. The cutoff threshold was incremented on a log scale to create seven datasets of decreasing sparsity. The classification task was to predict the provider-assigned label from the free-text chief complaint using BERT, with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Embeddings from Language Models (ELMo) as baselines. Performance was measured as the Top-k accuracy from k = 1:5 on a hold-out test set comprising 5% of the samples. The embedding for each free-text chief complaint was extracted as the final 768-dimensional layer of the BERT model and visualized using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE). Results:
      
    

    
      The models achieved increasing performance with datasets of decreasing sparsity, with BERT outperforming both LSTM and ELMo. The BERT model yielded Top-1 accuracies of 0.65 and 0.69, Top-3 accuracies of 0.87 and 0.90, and Top-5 accuracies of 0.92 and 0.94 on datasets comprised of 434 and 188 labels, respectively. Visualization using t-SNE mapped the learned embeddings in a clinically meaningful way, with related concepts embedded close to each other and broader types of chief complaints clustered together. Discussion:
      
    

    
      Despite the inherent noise in the chief complaint label space, the model was able to learn a rich representation of chief complaints and generate reasonable predictions of their labels. The learned embeddings accurately predict provider-assigned chief complaint labels and map semantically similar chief complaints to nearby points in vector space. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Such a model may be used to automatically map free-text chief complaints to structured fields and to assist the development of a standardized, data-driven ontology of chief complaints for healthcare institutions.","['1 Computational Biology and Bioinformatics Program, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.', '2 Department of Emergency Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.']","David Chang, Woo Suk Hong, Richard Andrew Taylor, ",JAMIA open,2020,BERT; chief complaint; emergency medicine; machine learning; natural language processing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32734154
949,Gender Disparities in Invited Commentary Authorship in 2459 Medical Journals,"Importance:
      
    

    
      In peer-reviewed medical journals, authoring an invited commentary on an original article is a recognition of expertise. It has been documented that women author fewer invited publications than men do. However, it is unknown whether this disparity is due to gender differences in characteristics that are associated with invitations, such as field of expertise, seniority, and scientific output. Objective:
      
    

    
      To estimate the odds ratio (OR) of authoring an invited commentary for women compared with men who had similar expertise, seniority, and publication metrics. Design, setting, and participants:
      
    

    
      This matched case-control study included all medical invited commentaries published from January 1, 2013, through December 31, 2017, in English-language medical journals and multidisciplinary journals. Invited commentaries were defined as publications that cite another publication within the same journal volume and issue. Bibliometric data were obtained from Scopus. Cases were defined as corresponding authors of invited commentaries in a given journal during the study period. Controls were matched to cases based on scientific expertise by calculating a similarity index for abstracts published during the same period using natural language processing. Data analyses were conducted from March 13, 2019, through May 3, 2019. Exposure:
      
    

    
      Corresponding or sole author gender was predicted from author first name and country of origin using genderize.io. Main outcomes and measures:
      
    

    
      The OR for gender was estimated after adjusting for field of expertise, publication output, citation impact, and years active (ie, years since first publication), with an interaction between gender and years active. Results:
      
    

    
      The final data set included 43 235 cases across 2549 journals; there were 34 047 unique intraciting commentary authors, among whom 9072 (26.6%) were women. For researchers who had been active for the median of 19 years, the odds of invited commentary authorship were 21% lower for women (OR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.77-0.81]; P < .001) compared with men who had similar scientific expertise, number of publications, and citation impact. For every decile increase in years active, the OR decreased by a factor of 0.97 (95% CI, 0.96-0.98; P < .001). Conclusions and relevance:
      
    

    
      In this case-control study, women had lower odds of authoring invited commentaries than their male peers. This disparity was larger for senior researchers. Journal editors could use natural language processing of published research to widen and diversify the pool of experts considered for commentary invitations.","['1 Harvard T.H.

950,Using natural language processing to extract structured epilepsy data from unstructured clinic letters: development and validation of the ExECT (extraction of epilepsy clinical text) system,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Routinely collected healthcare data are a powerful research resource but often lack detailed disease-specific information that is collected in clinical free text, for example, clinic letters. We aim to use natural language processing techniques to extract detailed clinical information from epilepsy clinic letters to enrich routinely collected data. Design:
      
    

    
      We used the general architecture for text engineering (GATE) framework to build an information extraction system, ExECT (extraction of epilepsy clinical text), combining rule-based and statistical techniques. We extracted nine categories of epilepsy information in addition to clinic date and date of birth across 200 clinic letters. We compared the results of our algorithm with a manual review of the letters by an epilepsy clinician. Setting:
      
    

    
      De-identified and pseudonymised epilepsy clinic letters from a Health Board serving half a million residents in Wales, UK. Results:
      
    

    
      We identified 1925 items of information with overall precision, recall and F1 score of 91.4%, 81.4% and 86.1%, respectively. Precision and recall for epilepsy-specific categories were: epilepsy diagnosis (88.1%, 89.0%), epilepsy type (89.8%, 79.8%), focal seizures (96.2%, 69.7%), generalised seizures (88.8%, 52.3%), seizure frequency (86.3%-53.6%), medication (96.1%, 94.0%), CT (55.6%, 58.8%), MRI (82.4%, 68.8%) and electroencephalogram (81.5%, 75.3%). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We have built an automated clinical text extraction system that can accurately extract epilepsy information from free text in clinic letters. This can enhance routinely collected data for research in the UK. The information extracted with ExECT such as epilepsy type, seizure frequency and neurological investigations are often missing from routinely collected data. We propose that our algorithm can bridge this data gap enabling further epilepsy research opportunities. While many of the rules in our pipeline were tailored to extract epilepsy specific information, our methods can be applied to other diseases and also can be used in clinical practice to record patient information in a structured manner.","['1 Neurology and Molecular Neuroscience Group, Institute of Life Science, Swansea University Medical School, Swansea University, Swansea, UK.', '2 Health Data Research UK, Data Science Building, Swansea University Medical School, Swansea University, Swansea, UK.', ""3 Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK."", '4 Faculty of Medicine and Health, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.']","Beata Fonferko-Shadrach, Arron S Lacey, Angus Roberts, Ashley Akbari, Simon Thompson, David V Ford, Ronan A Lyons, Mark I Rees, William Owen Pickrell, ",BMJ open,2019,epilepsy; information extraction; natural language processing; validation.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30940752
951,A Graph Convolutional Network-Based Method for Chemical-Protein Interaction Extraction: Algorithm Development,"Background:
      
    

    
      Extracting the interactions between chemicals and proteins from the biomedical literature is important for many biomedical tasks such as drug discovery, medicine precision, and knowledge graph construction. Several computational methods have been proposed for automatic chemical-protein interaction (CPI) extraction. However, the majority of these proposed models cannot effectively learn semantic and syntactic information from complex sentences in biomedical texts. Objective:
      
    

    
      To relieve this problem, we propose a method to effectively encode syntactic information from long text for CPI extraction. Methods:
      
    

    
      Since syntactic information can be captured from dependency graphs, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have recently drawn increasing attention in natural language processing. To investigate the performance of a GCN on CPI extraction, this paper proposes a novel GCN-based model. The model can effectively capture sequential information and long-range syntactic relations between words by using the dependency structure of input sentences. Results:
      
    

    
      We evaluated our model on the ChemProt corpus released by BioCreative VI; it achieved an F-score of 65.17%, which is 1.07% higher than that of the state-of-the-art system proposed by Peng et al. As indicated by the significance test (P<.001), the improvement is significant. It indicates that our model is effective in extracting CPIs. The GCN-based model can better capture the semantic and syntactic information of the sentence compared to other models, therefore alleviating the problems associated with the complexity of biomedical literature. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our model can obtain more information from the dependency graph than previously proposed models. Experimental results suggest that it is competitive to state-of-the-art methods and significantly outperforms other methods on the ChemProt corpus, which is the benchmark data set for CPI extraction.","['1 College of Computer Science and Technology, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China.', '2 Beijing Institute of Health Administration and Medical Information, Beijing, China.']","Erniu Wang, Fan Wang, Zhihao Yang, Lei Wang, Yin Zhang, Hongfei Lin, Jian Wang, ",JMIR medical informatics,2020,chemical-protein interaction; dependency structure; graph convolutional network; long-range syntactic.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32348257
952,MHCSeqNet: a deep neural network model for universal MHC binding prediction,"Background:
      
    

    
      Immunotherapy is an emerging approach in cancer treatment that activates the host immune system to destroy cancer cells expressing unique peptide signatures (neoepitopes). Administrations of cancer-specific neoepitopes in the form of synthetic peptide vaccine have been proven effective in both mouse models and human patients. Because only a tiny fraction of cancer-specific neoepitopes actually elicits immune response, selection of potent, immunogenic neoepitopes remains a challenging step in cancer vaccine development. A basic approach for immunogenicity prediction is based on the premise that effective neoepitope should bind with the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) with high affinity. Results:
      
    

    
      In this study, we developed MHCSeqNet, an open-source deep learning model, which not only outperforms state-of-the-art predictors on both MHC binding affinity and MHC ligand peptidome datasets but also exhibits promising generalization to unseen MHC class I alleles. MHCSeqNet employed neural network architectures developed for natural language processing to model amino acid sequence representations of MHC allele and epitope peptide as sentences with amino acids as individual words. This consideration allows MHCSeqNet to accept new MHC alleles as well as peptides of any length. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The improved performance and the flexibility offered by MHCSeqNet should make it a valuable tool for screening effective neoepitopes in cancer vaccine development.","['1 Department of Computer Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn University, 254 Phayathai Road, Pathumwan, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand.', '2 Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, 254 Phayathai Road, Pathumwan, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand. natapol.p@chula.ac.th.', '3 Vaccine and Therapeutic Protein, the Special Task Force for Activating Research, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand. natapol.p@chula.ac.th.', '4 Computational Molecular Biology Group, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand. sira.sr@chula.ac.th.', '5 Research Affairs, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, 1873 Rama IV Road, Pathum Wan, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand. sira.sr@chula.ac.th.', '6 Department of Computer Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn University, 254 Phayathai Road, Pathumwan, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand. ekapol.c@chula.ac.th.', '7 Computational Molecular Biology Group, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand. ekapol.c@chula.ac.th.', '8 The School of Information Science and Technology, Vidyasirimedhi Institute of Science and Technology, Wangchan Valley 555 Moo 1 Payupnai, Wangchan, Rayong, 21210, Thailand. ekapol.c@chula.ac.th.']","Poomarin Phloyphisut, Natapol Pornputtapong, Sira Sriswasdi, Ekapol Chuangsuwanich, ",BMC bioinformatics,2019,Deep learning; MHC epitope prediction; Recurrent neural networks.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31138107

Text classification (aka categorization) is an active research topic in recent years. However, much less attention was directed towards this task in Arabic, due to the lack of rich representative resources for training an Arabic text classifier. Therefore, we introduce a large Single-labeled Arabic News Articles Dataset (SANAD) of textual data collected from three news portals. The dataset is a large one consisting of almost 200k articles distributed into seven categories that we offer to the research community on Arabic computational linguistics. We anticipate that this rich dataset would make a great aid for a variety of NLP tasks on Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) textual data, especially for single label text classification purposes. We present the data in raw form. SANAD is composed of three main datasets scraped from three news portals, which are AlKhaleej, AlArabiya, and Akhbarona.

      Textual corpora are extremely important for various NLP applications as they provide information necessary for creating, setting and testing those applications and the corresponding tools. They are also crucial for designing reliable methods and reproducible results. Yet, in some areas, such as the medical area, due to confidentiality or to ethical reasons, it is complicated or even impossible to access representative textual data. We propose the CAS corpus built with clinical cases, such as they are reported in the published scientific literature in French. Results:
      
    

    
      Currently, the corpus contains 4,900 clinical cases in French, totaling nearly 1.7M word occurrences. Some clinical cases are associated with discussions. A subset of the whole set of cases is enriched with morpho-syntactic (PoS-tagging, lemmatization) and semantic (the UMLS concepts, negation, uncertainty) annotations. The corpus is being continuously enriched with new clinical cases and annotations. The CAS corpus has been compared with similar clinical narratives. When computed on tokenized and lowercase words, the Jaccard index indicates that the similarity between clinical cases and narratives reaches up to 0.9727. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      We assume that the CAS corpus can be effectively exploited for the development and testing of NLP tools and methods. Besides, the corpus will be used in NLP challenges and distributed to the research community.","['1 CNRS, UMR 8163, Lille, F-59000, France. natalia.grabar@univ-lille.fr.', '2 Univ.

      To assess public response to cancellations of elective surgeries following the American College of Surgeons’ (ACS) recommendation on March 13. Methods::
      
    

    
      We queried text comments from Reddit, a social media platform and the fifth most popular website in the United States. Comments were manually reviewed to assess for relevance to elective surgery in the United States during the global coronavirus outbreak, whether the text was written by a healthcare worker (HCW), whether the user was based in the United States, and whether the text documented cancellations of surgery, expected cancellations of surgery, or surgery ongoing after the ACS announcement. Analysis of overall sentiment and negativity in comment text was performed using the Valence Aware Dictionary for sEntiment Reasoning (VADER), a validated natural language processing tool previously used in studies of health behaviors using social media. Non-parametric tests were used for subgroup comparisons based on posting date and characteristics identified during manual review. Results::
      
    

    
      Following manual review, 1272 comments were included for analysis. Overall sentiment among non-HCWs became significantly more negative following the ACS announcement (P = 0.037). Overall sentiment did not significantly differ between HCWs and non-HCWs prior to the ACS announcement (P = 0.98), but non-HCW sentiment became significantly more negative than HCW sentiment after the announcement (P = 0.027). Negativity scores in posts describing cancellations were significantly higher among posts written by non-HCWs than HCWs (P = 0.028). Conclusions::

Thus, entering information into EHR still has remained a challenge. In this study, by applying the trigram language model, we presented a method to predict the next words while typing free texts. It is hypothesized that using this system may save typing time of free text. The words prediction model introduced in this research was trained and tested on the free texts regarding to colonoscopy, transesophageal echocardiogram, and anterior-cervical-decompression. Required time of typing for each of the above-mentioned reports calculated and compared with manual typing of the same words. It is revealed that 33.36% reduction in typing time and 73.53% reduction in keystroke.

961,A natural language processing framework to analyse the opinions on HPV vaccination reflected in twitter over 10 years (2008 - 2017),"In this research, we developed a natural language processing (NLP) framework to investigate the opinions on HPV vaccination reflected on Twitter over a 10-year period - 2008-2017. The NLP framework includes sentiment analysis, entity analysis, and artificial intelligence (AI)-based phrase association mining. The sentiment analysis demonstrates the sentiment fluctuation over the past 10 years. The results show that there are more negative tweets in 2008 to 2011 and 2015 to 2016. The entity extraction and analysis help to identify the organization, geographical location and events entities associated with the negative and positive tweets. The results show that the organization entities such as FDA, CDC and Merck occur in both negative and positive tweets of almost every year, whereas the geographical location entities mentioned in both negative and positive tweets change from year to year. The reason is because of the specific events that happened in those different locations. The objective of the AI-based phrase association mining is to identify the main topics reflected in both negative and positive tweets and detailed tweet content. Through the phrase association mining, we found that the main negative topics on Twitter include ""injuries"", ""deaths"", ""scandal"", ""safety concerns"", and ""adverse/side effects"", whereas the main positive topics include ""cervical cancers"", ""cervical screens"", ""prevents"", and ""vaccination campaigns"". We believe the results of this research can help public health researchers better understand the nature of social media influence on HPV vaccination attitudes and to develop strategies to counter the proliferation of misinformation.","['1 a Purdue School of Engineering and Technology, Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis , Indianapolis , IN , USA.', '2 b Pediatric Adolescent Health, Indiana University School of Medicine , Indianapolis , IN , USA.']","Xiao Luo, Gregory Zimet, Setu Shah, ",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,2019,HPV vaccine; Natural language processing; public health; sextually transmitted infection; social media.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31194609
962,KLOSURE: Closing in on open-ended patient questionnaires with text mining,"Background:
      
    

    
      Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) is an instrument used to quantify patients' perceptions about their knee condition and associated problems. It is administered as a 42-item closed-ended questionnaire in which patients are asked to self-assess five outcomes: pain, other symptoms, activities of daily living, sport and recreation activities, and quality of life. We developed KLOG as a 10-item open-ended version of the KOOS questionnaire in an attempt to obtain deeper insight into patients' opinions including their unmet needs. However, the open-ended nature of the questionnaire incurs analytical overhead associated with the interpretation of responses. The goal of this study was to automate such analysis. We implemented KLOSURE as a system for mining free-text responses to the KLOG questionnaire. It consists of two subsystems, one concerned with feature extraction and the other one concerned with classification of feature vectors. Feature extraction is performed by a set of four modules whose main functionalities are linguistic pre-processing, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition and lexicon lookup respectively. Outputs produced by each module are combined into feature vectors. The structure of feature vectors will vary across the KLOG questions. Finally, Weka, a machine learning workbench, was used for classification of feature vectors. Results:
      
    

    
      The precision of the system varied between 62.8 and 95.3%, whereas the recall varied from 58.3 to 87.6% across the 10 questions. The overall performance in terms of F-measure varied between 59.0 and 91.3% with an average of 74.4% and a standard deviation of 8.8. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We demonstrated the feasibility of mining open-ended patient questionnaires. By automatically mapping free text answers onto a Likert scale, we can effectively measure the progress of rehabilitation over time. In comparison to traditional closed-ended questionnaires, our approach offers much richer information that can be utilised to support clinical decision making. In conclusion, we demonstrated how text mining can be used to combine the benefits of qualitative and quantitative analysis of patient experiences.","['1 School of Computer Science & Informatics, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.

963,Deep learning in ophthalmology: The technical and clinical considerations,"The advent of computer graphic processing units, improvement in mathematical models and availability of big data has allowed artificial intelligence (AI) using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to achieve robust performance for broad applications in social-media, the internet of things, the automotive industry and healthcare. DL systems in particular provide improved capability in image, speech and motion recognition as well as in natural language processing. In medicine, significant progress of AI and DL systems has been demonstrated in image-centric specialties such as radiology, dermatology, pathology and ophthalmology. New studies, including pre-registered prospective clinical trials, have shown DL systems are accurate and effective in detecting diabetic retinopathy (DR), glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), retinopathy of prematurity, refractive error and in identifying cardiovascular risk factors and diseases, from digital fundus photographs. There is also increasing attention on the use of AI and DL systems in identifying disease features, progression and treatment response for retinal diseases such as neovascular AMD and diabetic macular edema using optical coherence tomography (OCT). Additionally, the application of ML to visual fields may be useful in detecting glaucoma progression. There are limited studies that incorporate clinical data including electronic health records, in AL and DL algorithms, and no prospective studies to demonstrate that AI and DL algorithms can predict the development of clinical eye disease. This article describes global eye disease burden, unmet needs and common conditions of public health importance for which AI and DL systems may be applicable. Technical and clinical aspects to build a DL system to address those needs, and the potential challenges for clinical adoption are discussed. AI, ML and DL will likely play a crucial role in clinical ophthalmology practice, with implications for screening, diagnosis and follow up of the major causes of vision impairment in the setting of ageing populations globally.","['1 Singapore Eye Research Institute, Singapore National Eye Center, Duke-NUS Medical School, National University of Singapore, Singapore.

The original date of diagnosis is an important piece of information for patient care and research, but is not consistently documented. We describe an attempt to build a pipeline for extracting dates with natural language processing (NLP) tools and techniques and classifying them as relevant diagnoses or not. Inaccurate and incomplete date extraction and interpretation impacted the performance of the overall pipeline. Existing lightweight Python packages tended to have low specificity for identifying and interpreting partial and relative dates in clinical text. A rules-based regular expression (regex) approach achieved recall of 83.0% on dates manually annotated as diagnosis dates, and 77.4% on all annotated dates. With only 3.8% of annotated dates representing initial MPN diagnoses, additional methods of targeting candidate date instances may alleviate noise and class imbalance.","['1 Department of Health Policy and Research, Weill Cornell Medicine, 402 E. 67th St, New York, NY 10065, United States; Division of Health Informatics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 600 3rd Ave, 8th Fl, New York, NY 10016, United States.

965,A validated natural language processing algorithm for brain imaging phenotypes from radiology reports in UK electronic health records,"Background:
      
    

    
      Manual coding of phenotypes in brain radiology reports is time consuming. We developed a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm to enable automatic identification of brain imaging in radiology reports performed in routine clinical practice in the UK National Health Service (NHS). Methods:
      
    

    
      We used anonymized text brain imaging reports from a cohort study of stroke/TIA patients and from a regional hospital to develop and test an NLP algorithm. Two experts marked up text in 1692 reports for 24 cerebrovascular and other neurological phenotypes. We developed and tested a rule-based NLP algorithm first within the cohort study, and further evaluated it in the reports from the regional hospital. Results:
      
    

    
      The agreement between expert readers was excellent (Cohen's κ =0.93) in both datasets. In the final test dataset (n = 700) in unseen regional hospital reports, the algorithm had very good performance for a report of any ischaemic stroke [sensitivity 89% (95% CI:81-94); positive predictive value (PPV) 85% (76-90); specificity 100% (95% CI:0.99-1.00)]; any haemorrhagic stroke [sensitivity 96% (95% CI: 80-99), PPV 72% (95% CI:55-84); specificity 100% (95% CI:0.99-1.00)]; brain tumours [sensitivity 96% (CI:87-99); PPV 84% (73-91); specificity: 100% (95% CI:0.99-1.00)] and cerebral small vessel disease and cerebral atrophy (sensitivity, PPV and specificity all > 97%). We obtained few reports of subarachnoid haemorrhage, microbleeds or subdural haematomas. In 110,695 reports from NHS Tayside, atrophy (n = 28,757, 26%), small vessel disease (15,015, 14%) and old, deep ischaemic strokes (10,636, 10%) were the commonest findings. Conclusions:

966,Assessing the Readability of Freely Available ICU Notes,"Unstructured data stored in an electronic health record (EHR) system can be very informative but require techniques such as natural language processing to extract the information. Developing such techniques requires shared data, but clinical data are often not easy to access. A freely available intensive care unit database, MIMIC-III, was released in 2016 to address this issue and benefit the informatics research community. While the database has been utilized by a few studies, the text characteristics of the notes have not been summarized. In this study, we present the summary of the basic text characteristics and the readability of the MIMIC-III ICU notes. We further compare the results with our previous study where proprietary EHR notes were used. The results show that the text characteristics of MIMIC-III notes were comparable with proprietary EHR notes, although the note readability index was slightly lower. The clinical notes in MIMIC-III can be a viable option for researchers who are interested in clinicians' language use but have no access to proprietary EHR systems.","['1 Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH.', ""2 Divison of Neonatology and Pulmonary Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center."", '3 Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH.']","Wu-Chen Su, Kevin Dufendach, Danny T Y Wu, ",AMIA Joint Summits on Translational Science proceedings.

967,Using natural language processing of clinical text to enhance identification of opioid-related overdoses in electronic health records data,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      To enhance automated methods for accurately identifying opioid-related overdoses and classifying types of overdose using electronic health record (EHR) databases. Methods:
      
    

    
      We developed a natural language processing (NLP) software application to code clinical text documentation of overdose, including identification of intention for self-harm, substances involved, substance abuse, and error in medication usage. Using datasets balanced with cases of suspected overdose and records of individuals at elevated risk for overdose, we developed and validated the application using Kaiser Permanente Northwest data, then tested portability of the application using Kaiser Permanente Washington data. Datasets were chart-reviewed to provide a gold standard for comparison and evaluation of the automated method. Results:
      
    

    
      The method performed well in identifying overdose (sensitivity = 0.80, specificity = 0.93), intentional overdose (sensitivity = 0.81, specificity = 0.98), and involvement of opioids (excluding heroin, sensitivity = 0.72, specificity = 0.96) and heroin (sensitivity = 0.84, specificity = 1.0). The method performed poorly at identifying adverse drug reactions and overdose due to patient error and fairly at identifying substance abuse in opioid-related unintentional overdose (sensitivity = 0.67, specificity = 0.96). Evaluation using validation datasets yielded significant reductions, in specificity and negative predictive values only, for many classifications mentioned above. However, these measures remained above 0.80, thus, performance observed during development was largely maintained during validation. Similar results were obtained when evaluating portability, although there was a significant reduction in sensitivity for unintentional overdose that was attributed to missing text clinical notes in the database. Conclusions:

968,Comparison of text processing methods in social media-based signal detection,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      Adverse event (AE) identification in social media (SM) can be performed using various types of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML). These methods can be categorized by complexity and precision level. Co-occurrence-based ML methods are rather basic, as they identify simultaneous appearance of drugs and clinical events in a single post. In contrast, statistical learning methods involve more complex NLP and identify drugs, events, and associations between them. We aimed to compare the ability of co-occurrence and NLP to identify AEs and signals of disproportionate reporting (SDR) in patient-generated SM. We also examined the performance of lift in SM-based signal detection (SD). Methods:
      
    

    
      Our examination was performed in a corpus of SM posts crawled from open online patient forums and communities, using the spontaneously reported VigiBase data as reference data set. Results:
      
    

    
      We found that co-occurrence and NLP produce AEs, which are 57% and 93% consistent with VigiBase AEs, respectively. Among the SDRs identified both in SM and in VigiBase, up to 55.3% were identified earlier in co-occurrence, and up to 32.1% were identified earlier in NLP-processed SM. Using lift in SM SD provided performance similar to frequentist methods, both in co-occurrence and in NLP-processed AEs. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Our results indicate that using SM as a data source complementary to traditional pharmacovigilance sources should be considered further.

969,ADFAC: Automatic detection of facial articulatory features,"Using computer-vision and image processing techniques, we aim to identify specific visual cues as induced by facial movements made during monosyllabic speech production. The method is named ADFAC: Automatic Detection of Facial Articulatory Cues. Four facial points of interest were detected automatically to represent head, eyebrow and lip movements: nose tip (proxy for head movement), medial point of left eyebrow, and midpoints of the upper and lower lips. The detected points were then automatically tracked in the subsequent video frames. Critical features such as the distance, velocity, and acceleration describing local facial movements with respect to the resting face of each speaker were extracted from the positional profiles of each tracked point. In this work, a variant of random forest is proposed to determine which facial features are significant in classifying speech sound categories. The method takes in both video and audio as input and extracts features from any video with a plain or simple background. The method is implemented in MATLAB and scripts are made available on GitHub for easy access.•Using innovative computer-vision and image processing techniques to automatically detect and track keypoints on the face during speech production in videos, thus allowing more natural articulation than previous sensor-based approaches.•Measuring multi-dimensional and dynamic facial movements by extracting time-related, distance-related and kinematics-related features in speech production.•Adopting the novel random forest classification approach to determine and rank the significance of facial features toward accurate speech sound categorization.","['1 Language and Brain Lab, Department of Linguistics, Simon Fraser University, Canada.', '2 Medical Image Analysis Lab, Simon Fraser University, Canada.', '3 KU Phonetics and Psycholinguistics Lab, Department of Linguistics, University of Kansas, United States.']","Saurabh Garg, Ghassan Hamarneh, Allard Jongman, Joan A Sereno, Yue Wang, ",MethodsX,2020,Computer vision; Discriminative analysis; Facial movements; Features; Image processing; Machine learning; Visual cues.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32760662
970,Natural language processing for mimicking clinical trial recruitment in critical care: a semi-automated simulation based on the LeoPARDS trial,"Clinical trials often fail to recruit an adequate number of appropriate patients. Identifying eligible trial participants is resource-intensive when relying on manual review of clinical notes, particularly in critical care settings where the time window is short. Automated review of electronic health records (EHR) may help, but much of the information is in free text rather than a computable form. We applied natural language processing (NLP) to free text EHR data using the CogStack platform to simulate recruitment into the LeoPARDS study, a clinical trial aiming to reduce organ dysfunction in septic shock. We applied an algorithm to identify eligible patients using a moving 1-hour time window, and compared patients identified by our approach with those actually screened and recruited for the trial, for the time period that data were available. We manually reviewed records of a random sample of patients identified by the algorithm but not screened in the original trial. Our method identified 376 patients, including 34 patients with EHR data available who were actually recruited to LeoPARDS in our centre. The sensitivity of CogStack for identifying patients screened was 90% (95% CI 85%, 93%). Of the 203 patients identified by both manual screening and CogStack, the index date matched in 95 (47%) and CogStack was earlier in 94 (47%).

971,Time-Domain Analysis of Molecular Dynamics Trajectories Using Deep Neural Networks: Application to Activity Ranking of Tankyrase Inhibitors,"Molecular dynamics simulations provide valuable insights into the behavior of molecular systems. Extending the recent trend of using machine learning techniques to predict physicochemical properties from molecular dynamics data, we propose to consider the trajectories as multidimensional time series represented by 2D tensors containing the ligand-protein interaction descriptor values for each time step. Similar in structure to the time series encountered in modern approaches for signal, speech, and natural language processing, these time series can be directly analyzed using long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks or convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The predictive regression models for the ligand-protein affinity were built for a subset of the PDBbind v.2017 database and applied to inhibitors of tankyrase, an enzyme of the poly(ADP-ribose)-polymerase (PARP) family that can be used in the treatment of colorectal cancer. As an additional test set, a subset of the Community Structure-Activity Resource (CSAR) data set was used. For comparison, the random forest and simple neural network models based on the crystal pose or the trajectory-averaged descriptors were used, as well as the commonly employed docking and molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) scores. Convolutional neural networks based on the 2D tensors of ligand-protein interaction descriptors for short (2 ns) trajectories provide the best accuracy and predictive power, reaching the Spearman rank correlation coefficient of 0.73 and Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.70 for the tankyrase test set. Taking into account the recent increase in computational power of modern GPUs and relatively low computational complexity of the proposed approach, it can be used as an advanced virtual screening filter for compound prioritization.","['1 Department of Chemistry , Lomonosov Moscow State University , Moscow 119991 , Russia.', '2 Digital BioPharm Ltd. , Hovseterveien 42 A, H0301 , Oslo 0768 , Norway.', '3 Department of Chemistry , Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University , Kukatpally, Hyderabad 500 085 , India.', '4 Wits Advanced Drug Delivery Platform Research Unit, Faculty of Health Sciences, School of Therapeutic Sciences, Department of Pharmacy and Pharmacology , University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg , 7 York Road , Parktown 2193 , South Africa.', '5 School of Pharmaceutical Education and Research , Jamia Hamdard , New Delhi 110 062 , India.']","Vladimir P Berishvili, Valentin O Perkin, Andrew E Voronkov, Eugene V Radchenko, Riyaz Syed, Chittireddy Venkata Ramana Reddy, Viness Pillay, Pradeep Kumar, Yahya E Choonara, Ahmed Kamal, Vladimir A Palyulin, ",Journal of chemical information and modeling,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31276400
972,Gait Recognition and Understanding Based on Hierarchical Temporal Memory Using 3D Gait Semantic Folding,"Gait recognition and understanding systems have shown a wide-ranging application prospect. However, their use of unstructured data from image and video has affected their performance, e.g., they are easily influenced by multi-views, occlusion, clothes, and object carrying conditions. This paper addresses these problems using a realistic 3-dimensional (3D) human structural data and sequential pattern learning framework with top-down attention modulating mechanism based on Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM). First, an accurate 2-dimensional (2D) to 3D human body pose and shape semantic parameters estimation method is proposed, which exploits the advantages of an instance-level body parsing model and a virtual dressing method. Second, by using gait semantic folding, the estimated body parameters are encoded using a sparse 2D matrix to construct the structural gait semantic image. In order to achieve time-based gait recognition, an HTM Network is constructed to obtain the sequence-level gait sparse distribution representations (SL-GSDRs). A top-down attention mechanism is introduced to deal with various conditions including multi-views by refining the SL-GSDRs, according to prior knowledge. The proposed gait learning model not only aids gait recognition tasks to overcome the difficulties in real application scenarios but also provides the structured gait semantic images for visual cognition. Experimental analyses on CMU MoBo, CASIA B, TUM-IITKGP, and KY4D datasets show a significant performance gain in terms of accuracy and robustness.","['1 Hunan Provincial Key Laboratory of Intelligent Computing and Language Information Processing, Hunan Normal University, Changsha 410000, China.', '2 School of Engineering, University of Warwick, Gibbet Hill Road, Coventry, CV4 7AL, UK.']","Jian Luo, Tardi Tjahjadi, ","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2020,gait recognition; hierarchical temporal memory; human identification; semantic folding.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32188067

We reported a potentially high false negative rate of real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 in the 610 hospitalized patients clinically diagnosed with COVID-19 during the 2019 outbreak. We also found that the RT-PCR results from several tests at different points were variable from the same patients during the course of diagnosis and treatment of these patients. Our results indicate that in addition to the emphasis on RT-PCR testing, clinical indicators such as computed tomography images should also be used not only for diagnosis and treatment but also for isolation, recovery/discharge, and transferring for hospitalized patients clinically diagnosed with COVID-19 during the current epidemic. These results suggested the urgent needs for the standard of procedures of sampling from different anatomic sites, sample transportation, optimization of RT-PCR, serology diagnosis/screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and distinct diagnosis from other respiratory diseases such as fluenza infections as well.","['1 Department of Intensive Care Unit, The Sixth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', '2 Department of Operation and Management, The Sixth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', '3 Natural Language Processing Group, iFLYTEK Research South China, Guangzhou, China.', '4 Department of Clinical Medicine, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Guangzhou, China.', '5 Department of Respiratory, Hankou Hospital of Wuhan, Wuhan, China.']","Yafang Li, Lin Yao, Jiawei Li, Lei Chen, Yiyan Song, Zhifang Cai, Chunhua Yang, ",Journal of medical virology,2020 Jul,COVID-19; RT-PCR.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32219885
974,Unsupervised word embeddings capture latent knowledge from materials science literature,"The overwhelming majority of scientific knowledge is published as text, which is difficult to analyse by either traditional statistical analysis or modern machine learning methods. By contrast, the main source of machine-interpretable data for the materials research community has come from structured property databases1,2, which encompass only a small fraction of the knowledge present in the research literature. Beyond property values, publications contain valuable knowledge regarding the connections and relationships between data items as interpreted by the authors. To improve the identification and use of this knowledge, several studies have focused on the retrieval of information from scientific literature using supervised natural language processing3-10, which requires large hand-labelled datasets for training. Here we show that materials science knowledge present in the published literature can be efficiently encoded as information-dense word embeddings11-13 (vector representations of words) without human labelling or supervision. Without any explicit insertion of chemical knowledge, these embeddings capture complex materials science concepts such as the underlying structure of the periodic table and structure-property relationships in materials. Furthermore, we demonstrate that an unsupervised method can recommend materials for functional applications several years before their discovery.

975,Learning tree-structured representation for 3D coronary artery segmentation,"Extensive research has been devoted to the segmentation of the coronary artery. However, owing to its complex anatomical structure, it is extremely challenging to automatically segment the coronary artery from 3D coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA). Inspired by recent ideas to use tree-structured long short-term memory (LSTM) to model the underlying tree structures for NLP tasks, we propose a novel tree-structured convolutional gated recurrent unit (ConvGRU) model to learn the anatomical structure of the coronary artery. However, unlike tree-structured LSTM proposed for semantic relatedness as well as sentiment classification in natural language processing, our tree-structured ConvGRU model considers the local spatial correlations in the input data as the convolutions are used for input-to-state as well as state-to-state transitions, thus more suitable for image analysis. To conduct voxel-wise segmentation, a tree-structured segmentation framework is presented. It consists of a fully convolutional network (FCN) for multi-scale discriminative feature extraction and the final prediction, and a tree-structured ConvGRU layer for anatomical structure modeling. The proposed framework is extensively evaluated on four large-scale 3D CCTA dataset (the largest to the best of our knowledge), and experiments show that our method is more accurate as well as efficient, compared with other coronary artery segmentation approaches.","['1 Department of Computer Science, UNC Charlotte, Charlotte, NC, USA.

976,The influence of syntactic expectations on reading comprehension is malleable and strategic: An eye-tracking study of English dative alternation,"Language processing is incremental and inherently predictive. Against this theoretic backdrop, we investigated the role of upcoming structural information in the comprehension of the English dative alternation. The use of eye-tracking enabled us to examine both the time course and locus of the effect associated with (a) structural expectations based on a lifetime of experience with language, and (b) rapid adaptation of the reader to the local statistics of the experiment. We quantified (a) as a verb subcategorization bias toward dative alternatives, and (b) as distributional biases in the syntactic input during the experiment. A reliable facilitatory effect of the verb bias was only observed in the double-object datives and only in the disambiguation region of the second object. Furthermore, structural priming led to an earlier locus of the verb bias effect, suggesting an interaction between (a) and (b). Our results offer a new outlook on the utilization of syntactic expectations during reading, in conjunction with rapid adaptation to the immediate linguistic environment. We demonstrate that this utilization is both malleable and strategic.

977,Detecting Adverse Drug Events with Rapidly Trained Classification Models,"Introduction:
      
    

    
      Identifying occurrences of medication side effects and adverse drug events (ADEs) is an important and challenging task because they are frequently only mentioned in clinical narrative and are not formally reported. Methods:
      
    

    
      We developed a natural language processing (NLP) system that aims to identify mentions of symptoms and drugs in clinical notes and label the relationship between the mentions as indications or ADEs. The system leverages an existing word embeddings model with induced word clusters for dimensionality reduction. It employs a conditional random field (CRF) model for named entity recognition (NER) and a random forest model for relation extraction (RE). Results:
      
    

    
      Final performance of each model was evaluated separately and then combined on a manually annotated evaluation set. The micro-averaged F1 score was 80.9% for NER, 88.1% for RE, and 61.2% for the integrated systems. Outputs from our systems were submitted to the NLP Challenges for Detecting Medication and Adverse Drug Events from Electronic Health Records (MADE 1.0) competition (Yu et al. in http://bio-nlp.org/index.php/projects/39-nlp-challenges , 2018). System performance was evaluated in three tasks (NER, RE, and complete system) with multiple teams submitting output from their systems for each task. Our RE system placed first in Task 2 of the challenge and our integrated system achieved third place in Task 3. Conclusion:

978,Are You What You Read? Predicting Implicit Attitudes to Immigration Based on Linguistic Distributional Cues From Newspaper Readership; A Pre-registered Study,"The implicit association test (IAT) measures bias towards often controversial topics (e.g., race, religion), while newspapers typically take strong positive/negative stances on such issues. In a pre-registered study, we developed and administered an immigration IAT to readers of the Daily Mail (a typically anti-immigration publication) and the Guardian (a typically pro-immigration publication) newspapers. IAT materials were constructed based on co-occurrence frequencies from each newspapers' website for immigration-related terms (migrant/immigrant) and positive/negative attributes (skilled/unskilled). Target stimuli showed stronger negative associations with immigration concepts in the Daily Mail compared to the Guardian, and stronger positive associations in the Guardian corpus compared to the Daily Mail corpus. Consistent with these linguistic distributional differences, Daily Mail readers exhibited a larger IAT bias, revealing stronger negative associations to immigration concepts compared to Guardian readers. This difference in overall bias was not fully explained by other variables, and raises the possibility that exposure to biased language contributes to biased implicit attitudes.","['1 Department of Psychology, Fylde College, Lancaster University, Bailrigg, United Kingdom.', '2 Institute for Natural Language Processing, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany.', '3 Linguistics and English Language, Lancaster University, Bailrigg, United Kingdom.', '4 Department of Psychology, School of Health and Wellbeing, University of Wolverhampton, Wolverhampton, United Kingdom.', '5 School of Social Sciences, Monash University, Caulfield East, VIC, Australia.']","Dermot Lynott, Michael Walsh, Tony McEnery, Louise Connell, Liam Cross, Kerry O'Brien, ",Frontiers in psychology,2019,IAT; bias; implicit association test; implicit attitudes; language.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31130888
979,Natural language processing for automated quantification of bone metastases reported in free-text bone scintigraphy reports,"Background:
      
    

    
      The widespread use of electronic patient-generated health data has led to unprecedented opportunities for automated extraction of clinical features from free-text medical notes. However, processing this rich resource of data for clinical and research purposes, depends on labor-intensive and potentially error-prone manual review. The aim of this study was to develop a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm for binary classification (single metastasis versus two or more metastases) in bone scintigraphy reports of patients undergoing surgery for bone metastases. Material and methods:
      
    

    
      Bone scintigraphy reports of patients undergoing surgery for bone metastases were labeled each by three independent reviewers using a binary classification (single metastasis versus two or more metastases) to establish a ground truth. A stratified 80:20 split was used to develop and test an extreme-gradient boosting supervised machine learning NLP algorithm. Results:
      
    

    
      A total of 704 free-text bone scintigraphy reports from 704 patients were included in this study and 617 (88%) had multiple bone metastases. In the independent test set (n = 141) not used for model development, the NLP algorithm achieved an 0.97 AUC-ROC (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92-0.99) for classification of multiple bone metastases and an 0.99 AUC-PRC (95% CI, 0.99-0.99). At a threshold of 0.90, NLP algorithm correctly identified multiple bone metastases in 117 of the 124 who had multiple bone metastases in the testing cohort (sensitivity 0.94) and yielded 3 false positives (specificity 0.82). At the same threshold, the NLP algorithm had a positive predictive value of 0.97 and F1-score of 0.96. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      NLP has the potential to automate clinical data extraction from free text radiology notes in orthopedics, thereby optimizing the speed, accuracy, and consistency of clinical chart review. Pending external validation, the NLP algorithm developed in this study may be implemented as a means to aid researchers in tackling large amounts of data.","['1 Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Orthopaedic Oncology Service, Massachusetts General Hospital - Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', '2 Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University Medical Center Utrecht - Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']","Olivier Q Groot, Michiel E R Bongers, Aditya V Karhade, Neal D Kapoor, Brian P Fenn, Jason Kim, J J Verlaan, Joseph H Schwab, ","Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)",2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32924696
980,"Automatic Attention Capture by Threatening, But Not by Semantically Incongruent Natural Scene Images","Visual objects are typically perceived as parts of an entire visual scene, and the scene's context provides information crucial in the object recognition process. Fundamental insights into the mechanisms of context-object integration have come from research on semantically incongruent objects, which are defined as objects with a very low probability of occurring in a given context. However, the role of attention in processing of the context-object mismatch remains unclear, with some studies providing evidence in favor, but other against an automatic capture of attention by incongruent objects. Therefore, in the present study, 25 subjects completed a dot-probe task, in which pairs of scenes-congruent and incongruent or neutral and threatening-were presented as task-irrelevant distractors. Importantly, threatening scenes are known to robustly capture attention and thus were included in the present study to provide a context for interpretation of results regarding incongruent scenes. Using N2 posterior-contralateral ERP component as a primary measure, we revealed that threatening images indeed capture attention automatically and rapidly, but semantically incongruent scenes do not benefit from an automatic attentional selection. Thus, our results suggest that identification of the context-object mismatch is not preattentive.","['1 Laboratory of Brain Imaging, Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology, 02-093 Warsaw, Poland.', '2 School of Psychological Science, Tel Aviv University, 69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.', '3 Sagol School of Neuroscience, Tel Aviv University, 69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.', '4 Laboratory of Language Neurobiology, Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology, 02-093 Warsaw, Poland.']","Marcin Furtak, Łucja Doradzińska, Alina Ptashynska, Liad Mudrik, Anna Nowicka, Michał Bola, ","Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)",2020,N2pc; attention capture; incongruent objects; natural scenes.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32198506

982,Text-mined dataset of inorganic materials synthesis recipes,"Materials discovery has become significantly facilitated and accelerated by high-throughput ab-initio computations. This ability to rapidly design interesting novel compounds has displaced the materials innovation bottleneck to the development of synthesis routes for the desired material. As there is no a fundamental theory for materials synthesis, one might attempt a data-driven approach for predicting inorganic materials synthesis, but this is impeded by the lack of a comprehensive database containing synthesis processes. To overcome this limitation, we have generated a dataset of ""codified recipes"" for solid-state synthesis automatically extracted from scientific publications. The dataset consists of 19,488 synthesis entries retrieved from 53,538 solid-state synthesis paragraphs by using text mining and natural language processing approaches. Every entry contains information about target material, starting compounds, operations used and their conditions, as well as the balanced chemical equation of the synthesis reaction. The dataset is publicly available and can be used for data mining of various aspects of inorganic materials synthesis.","['1 Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, CA, 94720, USA.', '2 Materials Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, 94720, USA.', '3 Institute of Mathematics and Computer Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Carlos, SP, Brazil.', '4 Google LLC, Mountain View, CA, USA.', '5 Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, CA, 94720, USA. gceder@berkeley.edu.', '6 Materials Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, 94720, USA. gceder@berkeley.edu.']","Olga Kononova, Haoyan Huo, Tanjin He, Ziqin Rong, Tiago Botari, Wenhao Sun, Vahe Tshitoyan, Gerbrand Ceder, ",Scientific data,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31615989
983,Generation and evaluation of artificial mental health records for Natural Language Processing,"A serious obstacle to the development of Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods in the clinical domain is the accessibility of textual data. The mental health domain is particularly challenging, partly because clinical documentation relies heavily on free text that is difficult to de-identify completely. This problem could be tackled by using artificial medical data. In this work, we present an approach to generate artificial clinical documents. We apply this approach to discharge summaries from a large mental healthcare provider and discharge summaries from an intensive care unit. We perform an extensive intrinsic evaluation where we (1) apply several measures of text preservation; (2) measure how much the model memorises training data; and (3) estimate clinical validity of the generated text based on a human evaluation task. Furthermore, we perform an extrinsic evaluation by studying the impact of using artificial text in a downstream NLP text classification task. We found that using this artificial data as training data can lead to classification results that are comparable to the original results. Additionally, using only a small amount of information from the original data to condition the generation of the artificial data is successful, which holds promise for reducing the risk of these artificial data retaining rare information from the original data. This is an important finding for our long-term goal of being able to generate artificial clinical data that can be released to the wider research community and accelerate advances in developing computational methods that use healthcare data.","['1 1Department of Computing, Imperial College London, London, SW7 2AZ UK.', ""2 2IoPPN, King's College London, SE5 8AF London, UK."", '3 3Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, Warneford Hospital, OX3 7JX Oxford, UK.', '4 4Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Downing Street, Cambridge, CB2 3EB UK.', '5 5Cambridge Biomedical Campus, Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust, Box 190, Cambridge, CB2 0QQ UK.', '6 6South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, SE5 8AZ London, UK.']","Julia Ive, Natalia Viani, Joyce Kam, Lucia Yin, Somain Verma, Stephen Puntis, Rudolf N Cardinal, Angus Roberts, Robert Stewart, Sumithra Velupillai, ",NPJ digital medicine,2020,Medical research; Scientific community.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32435697
984,BioBERT: a pre-trained biomedical language representation model for biomedical text mining,"Motivation:
      
    

    
      Biomedical text mining is becoming increasingly important as the number of biomedical documents rapidly grows. With the progress in natural language processing (NLP), extracting valuable information from biomedical literature has gained popularity among researchers, and deep learning has boosted the development of effective biomedical text mining models. However, directly applying the advancements in NLP to biomedical text mining often yields unsatisfactory results due to a word distribution shift from general domain corpora to biomedical corpora. In this article, we investigate how the recently introduced pre-trained language model BERT can be adapted for biomedical corpora. Results:
      
    

    
      We introduce BioBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for Biomedical Text Mining), which is a domain-specific language representation model pre-trained on large-scale biomedical corpora. With almost the same architecture across tasks, BioBERT largely outperforms BERT and previous state-of-the-art models in a variety of biomedical text mining tasks when pre-trained on biomedical corpora. While BERT obtains performance comparable to that of previous state-of-the-art models, BioBERT significantly outperforms them on the following three representative biomedical text mining tasks: biomedical named entity recognition (0.62% F1 score improvement), biomedical relation extraction (2.80% F1 score improvement) and biomedical question answering (12.24% MRR improvement). Our analysis results show that pre-training BERT on biomedical corpora helps it to understand complex biomedical texts. Availability and implementation:

985,Altered dynamics of brain segregation and integration in poststroke aphasia,"Poststroke aphasia (PSA) results from direct effect of focal lesions and dysfunction of distributed language networks. However, how flexible the activity at specific nodes control global dynamics is currently unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that alterations in the regional activity may cause imbalances between segregation and integration in temporo-spatial pattern, and the transient dynamics are disrupted in PSA patients. Specifically, we applied dynamic framework to eyes-closed resting-state functional MRI data from PSA patients (n = 17), and age-, gender-, and education-matched healthy controls (HCs, n = 20). Subsequently, we calculated two basis brain organizational principles: ""dynamic segregation,"" obtained from dynamic amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (dALFF), which represent the specialized processing within interconnected brain regions; and ""dynamic integration,"" obtained from dynamic functional connectivity, which measures the efficient communication between interconnected brain regions. We found that both measures were decreased in the PSA patients within the left frontal and temporal subregions compared to the HCs. PSA patients displayed increased flexibility of interaction between left temporo-frontal subregions and right temporo-parieto-frontal subnetworks. Furthermore, we found that dALFF in the pars triangularis of left inferior frontal gyrus was associated with aphasia quotient. These findings suggest that the reduced temporal flexibility of regional activity in language-relevant cortical regions in PSA is related to the disrupted organization of intrahemispheric networks, leading to a loss of the corresponding functions. By using dynamic framework, our results offer valuable information about the alterations in segregation and integration of spatiotemporal information across networks and illuminate how dysfunction in flexible activity may underlie language deficits in PSA.","['1 The Clinical Hospital of Chengdu Brain Science Institute, MOE Key Lab for Neuroinformation, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.', '2 School of Medicine, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.', '3 Department of Biomedical Engineering, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, New Jersey.', '4 School of Life Science and Technology, Center for Information in Medicine, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.']","Jing Guo, Bharat B Biswal, Shaoqiang Han, Jiao Li, Siqi Yang, Mi Yang, Huafu Chen, ",Human brain mapping,2019,dynamic integration; dynamic segregation; poststroke aphasia; resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31016854

New informatics approaches including natural language processing (NLP) can be utilized to identify symptoms from narrative clinical documentation. Here we utilized NLP to identify seven patient symptoms from notes of maintenance hemodialysis patients of the BioMe Biobank and validated our findings using a separate cohort and the MIMIC-III database. NLP performance was compared for symptom detection with International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9/10 codes and the performance of both methods were validated against manual chart review. From 1034 and 519 hemodialysis patients within BioMe and MIMIC-III databases, respectively, the most frequently identified symptoms by NLP were fatigue, pain, and nausea/vomiting. In BioMe, sensitivity for NLP (0.85 - 0.99) was higher than for ICD codes (0.09 - 0.59) for all symptoms with similar results in the BioMe validation cohort and MIMIC-III. ICD codes were significantly more specific for nausea/vomiting in BioMe and more specific for fatigue, depression, and pain in the MIMIC-III database. A majority of patients in both cohorts had four or more symptoms. Patients with more symptoms identified by NLP, ICD, and chart review had more clinical encounters. NLP had higher specificity in inpatient notes but higher sensitivity in outpatient notes and performed similarly across pain severity subgroups. Thus, NLP had higher sensitivity compared to ICD codes for identification of seven common hemodialysis-related symptoms, with comparable specificity between the two methods. Hence, NLP may be useful for the high-throughput identification of patient-centered outcomes when using electronic health records.","['1 Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA; The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Department of Genetics and Genomics Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.

988,How pattern information analyses of semantic brain activity elicited in language comprehension could contribute to the early identification of Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with a loss of semantic knowledge reflecting brain pathophysiology that begins years before dementia. Identifying early signs of pathophysiology induced dysfunction in the neural systems that access and process words' meaning could therefore help forecast dementia. This article reviews pioneering studies demonstrating that abnormal functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) response patterns elicited in semantic tasks reflect both AD-pathophysiology and the hereditary risk of AD, and also can help forecast cognitive decline. However, to bring current semantic task-based fMRI research up to date with new AD research guidelines the relationship with different types of AD-pathophysiology needs to be more thoroughly examined. We shall argue that new analytic techniques and experimental paradigms will be critical for this. Previous work has relied on specialized tests of specific components of semantic knowledge/processing (e.g. famous name recognition) to reveal coarse AD-related changes in activation across broad brain regions. Recent computational advances now enable more detailed tests of the semantic information that is represented within brain regions during more natural language comprehension. These new methods stand to more directly index how pathophysiology alters neural information processing, whilst using language comprehension as the basis for a more comprehensive examination of semantic brain function. We here connect the semantic pattern information analysis literature up with AD research to raise awareness to potential cross-disciplinary research opportunities.","['1 Department of Neuroscience, University of Rochester Medical Center, United States of America.

991,Ensemble method-based extraction of medication and related information from clinical texts,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Accurate and complete information about medications and related information is crucial for effective clinical decision support and precise health care. Recognition and reduction of adverse drug events is also central to effective patient care. The goal of this research is the development of a natural language processing (NLP) system to automatically extract medication and adverse drug event information from electronic health records. This effort was part of the 2018 n2c2 shared task on adverse drug events and medication extraction. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      The new NLP system implements a stacked generalization based on a search-based structured prediction algorithm for concept extraction. We trained 4 sequential classifiers using a variety of structured learning algorithms. To enhance accuracy, we created a stacked ensemble consisting of these concept extraction models trained on the shared task training data. We implemented a support vector machine model to identify related concepts. Results:
      
    

    
      Experiments with the official test set showed that our stacked ensemble achieved an F1 score of 92.66%. The relation extraction model with given concepts reached a 93.59% F1 score. Our end-to-end system yielded overall micro-averaged recall, precision, and F1 score of 92.52%, 81.88% and 86.88%, respectively. Our NLP system for adverse drug events and medication extraction ranked within the top 5 of teams participating in the challenge. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      This study demonstrated that a stacked ensemble with a search-based structured prediction algorithm achieved good performance by effectively integrating the output of individual classifiers and could provide a valid solution for other clinical concept extraction tasks.","['1 Biomedical Informatics Center, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, USA.']","Youngjun Kim, Stéphane M Meystre, ",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2020,drug-related side effects and adverse reactions [MeSH C25.100]; medical informatics [L01.313.500]; natural language processing (NLP) [L01.224.050.375.580]; neural networks [L01.224.050.375.605].,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31282932
992,Text Classification to Inform Suicide Risk Assessment in Electronic Health Records,"Assessing a patient's risk of an impending suicide attempt has been hampered by limited information about dynamic factors that change rapidly in the days leading up to an attempt. The storage of patient data in electronic health records (EHRs) has facilitated population-level risk assessment studies using machine learning techniques. Until recently, most such work has used only structured EHR data and excluded the unstructured text of clinical notes. In this article, we describe our experiments on suicide risk assessment, modelling the problem as a classification task. Given the wealth of text data in mental health EHRs, we aimed to assess the impact of using this data in distinguishing periods prior to a suicide attempt from those not preceding such an attempt. We compare three different feature sets, one structured and two text-based, and show that inclusion of text features significantly improves classification accuracy in suicide risk assessment.","[""1 Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK."", '2 School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, KTH, Stockholm, Sweden.', '3 South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.']","André Bittar, Sumithra Velupillai, Angus Roberts, Rina Dutta, ",Studies in health technology and informatics,2019,Natural Language Processing; Risk Assessment; Suicide.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31437881

      Systematic identification of patients allows researchers and clinicians to test new models of care delivery. EHR phenotypes-structured algorithms based on clinical indicators from EHRs-can aid in such identification. Objective:
      
    

    
      To develop EHR phenotypes to identify decedents with stage 4 solid-tumor cancer or stage 4-5 chronic kidney disease (CKD). Design:
      
    

    
      We developed two EHR phenotypes. Each phenotype included International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 and ICD-10 codes. We used natural language processing (NLP) to further specify stage 4 cancer, and lab values for CKD. Subjects:
      
    

    
      Decedents with cancer or CKD who had been admitted to an academic medical center in the last 6 months of life and died August 26, 2017-December 31, 2017. Main measure:
      
    

    
      We calculated positive predictive values (PPV), false discovery rates (FDR), false negative rates (FNR), and sensitivity. Phenotypes were validated by a comparison with manual chart review. We also compared the EHR phenotype results to those admitted to the oncology and nephrology inpatient services. Key results:
      
    

    
      The EHR phenotypes identified 271 decedents with cancer, of whom 186 had stage 4 disease; of 192 decedents with CKD, 89 had stage 4-5 disease. The EHR phenotype for stage 4 cancer had a PPV of 68.6%, FDR of 31.4%, FNR of 0.5%, and 99.5% sensitivity. The EHR phenotype for stage 4-5 CKD had a PPV of 46.4%, FDR of 53.7%, FNR of 0.0%, and 100% sensitivity. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      EHR phenotypes efficiently identified patients who died with late-stage cancer or CKD. Future EHR phenotypes can prioritize specificity over sensitivity, and incorporate stratification of high- and low-palliative care need. EHR phenotypes are a promising method for identifying patients for research and clinical purposes, including equitable distribution of specialty palliative care.","['1 Division of General Internal Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA. ernecoff.natalie@pitt.edu.', '2 Sheps Center for Health Services Research, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.', '3 Division of Geriatric Medicine & Palliative Care Program, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.', '4 North Carolina Translational and Clinical Sciences Institute, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.', '5 Department of Health Policy and Management, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.', '6 Department of Health Policy, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.']","Natalie C Ernecoff, Kathryn L Wessell, Laura C Hanson, Adam M Lee, Christopher M Shea, Stacie B Dusetzina, Morris Weinberger, Antonia V Bennett, ",Journal of general internal medicine,2019 Dec,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31396813
994,A Lightweight API-Based Approach for Building Flexible Clinical NLP Systems,"Natural language processing (NLP) has become essential for secondary use of clinical data. Over the last two decades, many clinical NLP systems were developed in both academia and industry. However, nearly all existing systems are restricted to specific clinical settings mainly because they were developed for and tested with specific datasets, and they often fail to scale up. Therefore, using existing NLP systems for one's own clinical purposes requires substantial resources and long-term time commitments for customization and testing. Moreover, the maintenance is also troublesome and time-consuming. This research presents a lightweight approach for building clinical NLP systems with limited resources. Following the design science research approach, we propose a lightweight architecture which is designed to be composable, extensible, and configurable. It takes NLP as an external component which can be accessed independently and orchestrated in a pipeline via web APIs. To validate its feasibility, we developed a web-based prototype for clinical concept extraction with six well-known NLP APIs and evaluated it on three clinical datasets. In comparison with available benchmarks for the datasets, three high F1 scores (0.861, 0.724, and 0.805) were obtained from the evaluation. It also gained a low F1 score (0.373) on one of the tests, which probably is due to the small size of the test dataset. The development and evaluation of the prototype demonstrates that our approach has a great potential for building effective clinical NLP systems with limited resources.","['1 Department of Computing and Information Sciences, Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands.']","Zhengru Shen, Hugo van Krimpen, Marco Spruit, ",Journal of healthcare engineering,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31511785
995,Fully connected neural network for virtual monochromatic imaging in spectral computed tomography,"Spectral computed tomography (SCT) has advantages in multienergy material decomposition for material discrimination and quantitative image reconstruction. However, due to the nonideal physical effects of photon counting detectors, including charge sharing, pulse pileup and K  -escape, it is difficult to obtain precise system models in practical SCT systems. Serious spectral distortion is unavoidable, which introduces error into the decomposition model and affects material decomposition accuracy. Recently, neural networks demonstrated great potential in image segmentation, object detection, natural language processing, etc. By adjusting the interconnection relationship among internal nodes, it provides a way to mine information from data. Considering the difficulty in modeling SCT system spectra and the superiority of data-driven characteristics of neural networks, we proposed a spectral information extraction method for virtual monochromatic attenuation maps using a simple fully connected neural network without knowing spectral information. In our method, virtual monochromatic linear attenuation coefficients can be obtained directly through our neural network, which could contribute to further material recognition. Our method also provides outstanding performance on denoising and artifacts suppression. It can be furnished for SCT systems with different settings of energy bins or thresholds. Various substances available can be used for training. The trained neural network has a good generalization ability according to our results. The testing mean square errors are about 1 × 10 - 05    cm - 2    .","['1 Tsinghua University, Department of Engineering Physics, Beijing, China.', '2 Key Laboratory of Particle and Radiation Imaging (Tsinghua University), Ministry of Education, Beijing, China.']","Chuqing Feng, Kejun Kang, Yuxiang Xing, ","Journal of medical imaging (Bellingham, Wash.)",2019 Jan,neural network; spectral computed tomography; spectral information extraction.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30397632
996,Frontal-midline theta frequency and probabilistic learning: A transcranial alternating current stimulation study,"Probabilistic learning is a fundamental cognitive ability that extracts and represents regularities of our environment enabling predictive processing during perception and acquisition of perceptual, motor, cognitive, and social skills. Previous studies show competition between neural networks related to executive function/working memory vs. probabilistic learning. Theta synchronization has been associated with the former while desynchronization with the latter in correlational studies. In the present paper our aim was to test causal relationship between fronto-parietal midline theta synchronization and probabilistic learning with non-invasive transcranial alternating current (tACS) stimulation. We hypothesize that theta synchronization disrupts probabilistic learning performance by modulating the competitive relationship. Twenty-six young adults performed the Alternating Serial Reaction Time (ASRT) task to assess probabilistic learning in two sessions that took place one week apart. Stimulation was applied in a double-blind cross-over within-subject design with an active theta tACS and a sham stimulation in a counter-balanced order between participants. Sinusoidal current was administered with 1 mA peak-to-peak intensity throughout the task (approximately 20 min) for the active stimulation and 30 s for the sham. We did not find an effect of fronto-parietal midline theta tACS on probabilistic learning comparing performance during active and sham stimulation. To influence probabilistic learning, we suggest applying higher current intensity and stimulation parameters more precisely aligned to endogenous brain activity for future studies.","['1 Doctoral School of Psychology, ELTE Eötvös Loránd University, Budapest, Hungary; Institute of Psychology, ELTE Eötvös Loránd University, Budapest, Hungary; Brain, Memory and Language Research Group, Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience and Psychology, Research Centre for Natural Sciences, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Budapest, Hungary.', '2 Institute of Psychology, ELTE Eötvös Loránd University, Budapest, Hungary.', '3 Institute of Psychology, ELTE Eötvös Loránd University, Budapest, Hungary; Brain, Memory and Language Research Group, Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience and Psychology, Research Centre for Natural Sciences, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Budapest, Hungary; Centre of Thinking and Learning, Institute for Lifecourse Development, School of Human Sciences, University of Greenwich, London, United Kingdom.', '4 Institute of Psychology, ELTE Eötvös Loránd University, Budapest, Hungary; Brain, Memory and Language Research Group, Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience and Psychology, Research Centre for Natural Sciences, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Budapest, Hungary; Lyon Neuroscience Research Center (CRNL), INSERM, CNRS, Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Lyon, France.

997,Crystal Bone: Predicting Short-Term Fracture Risk From Electronic Health Records With Deep Learning,"Background:
      
    

    
      Fractures due to osteoporosis and low bone mass are common and give rise to significant clinical, personal, and economic burden. Even after a fracture occurs, high fracture risk remains widely underdiagnosed and undertreated. Common fracture risk assessment tools utilize a subset of clinical risk factors for prediction, and often require manual data entry. Furthermore, these tools predict risk over the long term, and do not explicitly provide short-term risk estimates necessary to identify patients likely to experience a fracture in the next 1-2 years. Objective:
      
    

    
      The goal of this study was to develop and evaluate an algorithmic approach to the identification of patients at risk of fracture in the next 1-2 years. In order to address the aforementioned limitations of current prediction tools, this approach focuses on a short-term timeframe, automated data entry, and the use of longitudinal data to inform the predictions. Methods:
      
    

    
      Using electronic health record (EHR) data from over 1M patients, we developed Crystal Bone, a method that applies machine learning techniques from Natural Language Processing to the temporal nature of patient histories to generate short-term fracture risk predictions. Similar to how language models predict the next word in a given sentence or the topic of a document, Crystal Bone predicts whether a patient's future trajectory might contain a fracture event, or whether the ""signature"" of the patient's journey is similar to that of a typical future fracture patient. Results:
      
    

    
      The proposed models accurately predict fracture risk in the next 1-2 years for patients aged over 50 years (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve [AUROC]=0.81 in a holdout set with 192,590 patients). These algorithms outperform the experimental baselines (AUROC=0.67) and have shown meaningful improvements when compared to a retrospective approximation of human-level performance, such as correctly identifying 9649 of 13,765 (70%) at-risk patients who did not receive any preventative bone-health-related medical interventions from their physicians. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      These findings indicate that it is possible to use a patient's unique medical history as it changes over time to predict the risk of short-term fracture. Validating and applying such a tool within the healthcare system could enable automated and widespread prediction of this risk and may help with identification of patients at very high risk of fracture.","['1 Digital Health & Innovation, Amgen Inc., 1 Amgen Center DriveMS 38-3B, Thousand Oaks, US.', '2 Global Medical Operations, Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, US.', '3 U.S. Medical, Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, US.', '4 Department of Oncology & Metabolism, The University of Sheffield, Sheffield, GB.', '5 Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, US.']","Yasmeen Adar Almog, Angshu Rai, Patrick Zhang, Amanda Moulaison, Ross Powell, Anirban Mishra, Kerry Weinberg, Celeste Hamilton, Mary Oates, Eugene McCloskey, Steven R Cummings, ",Journal of medical Internet research,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32956069
998,Mining of Textual Health Information from Reddit: Analysis of Chronic Diseases With Extracted Entities and Their Relations,"Background:
      
    

    
      Social media platforms constitute a rich data source for natural language processing tasks such as named entity recognition, relation extraction, and sentiment analysis. In particular, social media platforms about health provide a different insight into patient's experiences with diseases and treatment than those found in the scientific literature. Objective:
      
    

    
      This paper aimed to report a study of entities related to chronic diseases and their relation in user-generated text posts. The major focus of our research is the study of biomedical entities found in health social media platforms and their relations and the way people suffering from chronic diseases express themselves. Methods:
      
    

    
      We collected a corpus of 17,624 text posts from disease-specific subreddits of the social news and discussion website Reddit. For entity and relation extraction from this corpus, we employed the PKDE4J tool developed by Song et al (2015). PKDE4J is a text mining system that integrates dictionary-based entity extraction and rule-based relation extraction in a highly flexible and extensible framework. Results:
      
    

    
      Using PKDE4J, we extracted 2 types of entities and relations: biomedical entities and relations and subject-predicate-object entity relations. In total, 82,138 entities and 30,341 relation pairs were extracted from the Reddit dataset. The most highly mentioned entities were those related to oncological disease (2884 occurrences of cancer) and asthma (2180 occurrences). The relation pair anatomy-disease was the most frequent (5550 occurrences), the highest frequent entities in this pair being cancer and lymph. The manual validation of the extracted entities showed a very good performance of the system at the entity extraction task (3682/5151, 71.48% extracted entities were correctly labeled). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      This study showed that people are eager to share their personal experience with chronic diseases on social media platforms despite possible privacy and security issues. The results reported in this paper are promising and demonstrate the need for more in-depth studies on the way patients with chronic diseases express themselves on social media platforms.","['1 Division of Medical Information Sciences, University Hospitals of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland.', '2 Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland.', '3 Department of Library and Information Science, Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']","Vasiliki Foufi, Tatsawan Timakum, Christophe Gaudet-Blavignac, Christian Lovis, Min Song, ",Journal of medical Internet research,2019,chronic disease; data mining; social media.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31199327
999,Resolving the (Apparent) Talker Recognition Paradox in Developmental Speech Perception,"The infant literature suggests that humans enter the world with impressive built-in talker processing abilities. For example, newborns prefer the sound of their mother's voice over the sound of another woman's voice, and well before their first birthday, infants tune in to language-specific speech cues for distinguishing between unfamiliar talkers. The early childhood literature, however, suggests that preschoolers are unable to learn to identify the voices of two unfamiliar talkers unless these voices are highly distinct from one another, and that adult-level talker recognition does not emerge until children near adolescence. How can we reconcile these apparently paradoxical messages conveyed by the infant and early childhood literatures? Here, we address this question by testing 16.5-month-old infants (N = 80) in three talker recognition experiments. Our results demonstrate that infants at this age have difficulty recognizing unfamiliar talkers, suggesting that talker recognition (associating voices with people) is mastered later in life than talker discrimination (telling voices apart). We conclude that methodological differences across the infant and early childhood literatures-rather than a true developmental discontinuity-account for the performance differences in talker processing between these two age groups. Related findings in other areas of developmental psychology are discussed.","['1 Department of Psychology, University of Toronto Mississauga.', '2 Department of Psychology, University of California, Los Angeles.']","Natalie Fecher, Melissa Paquette-Smith, Elizabeth K Johnson, ",Infancy : the official journal of the International Society on Infant Studies,2019 Jul,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32677248

      To examine the association between the medical imaging utilization and information related to patients' socioeconomic, demographic and clinical factors during the patients' ED visits; and to develop predictive models using these associated factors including natural language elements to predict the medical imaging utilization at pediatric ED. Methods:
      
    

    
      Pediatric patients' data from the 2012-2016 United States National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey was included to build the models to predict the use of imaging in children presenting to the ED. Multivariable logistic regression models were built with structured variables such as temperature, heart rate, age, and unstructured variables such as reason for visit, free text nursing notes and combined data available at triage. NLP techniques were used to extract information from the unstructured data. Results:
      
    

    
      Of the 27,665 pediatric ED visits included in the study, 8394 (30.3%) received medical imaging in the ED, including 6922 (25.0%) who had an X-ray and 1367 (4.9%) who had a computed tomography (CT) scan. In the predictive model including only structured variables, the c-statistic was 0.71 (95% CI: 0.70-0.71) for any imaging use, 0.69 (95% CI: 0.68-0.70) for X-ray, and 0.77 (95% CI: 0.76-0.78) for CT. Models including only unstructured information had c-statistics of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.81-0.82) for any imaging use, 0.82 (95% CI: 0.82-0.83) for X-ray, and 0.85 (95% CI: 0.83-0.86) for CT scans. When both structured variables and free text variables were included, the c-statistics reached 0.82 (95% CI: 0.82-0.83) for any imaging use, 0.83 (95% CI: 0.83-0.84) for X-ray, and 0.87 (95% CI: 0.86-0.88) for CT. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Both CT and X-rays are commonly used in the pediatric ED with one third of the visits receiving at least one. Patients' socioeconomic, demographic and clinical factors presented at ED triage period were associated with the medical imaging utilization. Predictive models combining structured and unstructured variables available at triage performed better than models using structured or unstructured variables alone, suggesting the potential for use of NLP in determining resource utilization.","['1 Department of Systems, Populations and Leadership, University of Michigan School of Nursing, Ann Arbor, USA. zhangxyu@umich.edu.', '2 Department of Emergency Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, USA.', '3 Department of Anatomy and Medical Imaging, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.', '4 Oxford Centre for Clinical Magnetic Resonance Research, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', '5 Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China. yangsheng@njmu.edu.cn.', '6 Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, USA. yangsheng@njmu.edu.cn.', '7 Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Michigan School of Medicine, Ann Arbor, USA.']","Xingyu Zhang, M Fernanda Bellolio, Pau Medrano-Gracia, Konrad Werys, Sheng Yang, Prashant Mahajan, ",BMC medical informatics and decision making,2019,Medical imaging utilization; Natural language processing; Pediatric emergency department; Predictive model.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31888609
1001,SemBioNLQA: A semantic biomedical question answering system for retrieving exact and ideal answers to natural language questions,"Background and objective:
      
    

    
      Question answering (QA), the identification of short accurate answers to users questions written in natural language expressions, is a longstanding issue widely studied over the last decades in the open-domain. However, it still remains a real challenge in the biomedical domain as the most of the existing systems support a limited amount of question and answer types as well as still require further efforts in order to improve their performance in terms of precision for the supported questions. Here, we present a semantic biomedical QA system named SemBioNLQA which has the ability to handle the kinds of yes/no, factoid, list, and summary natural language questions. Methods:
      
    

    
      This paper describes the system architecture and an evaluation of the developed end-to-end biomedical QA system named SemBioNLQA, which consists of question classification, document retrieval, passage retrieval and answer extraction modules. It takes natural language questions as input, and outputs both short precise answers and summaries as results. The SemBioNLQA system, dealing with four types of questions, is based on (1) handcrafted lexico-syntactic patterns and a machine learning algorithm for question classification, (2) PubMed search engine and UMLS similarity for document retrieval, (3) the BM25 model, stemmed words and UMLS concepts for passage retrieval, and (4) UMLS metathesaurus, BioPortal synonyms, sentiment analysis and term frequency metric for answer extraction. Results and conclusion:
      
    

    
      Compared with the current state-of-the-art biomedical QA systems, SemBioNLQA, a fully automated system, has the potential to deal with a large amount of question and answer types. SemBioNLQA retrieves quickly users' information needs by returning exact answers (e.g., ""yes"", ""no"", a biomedical entity name, etc.) and ideal answers (i.e., paragraph-sized summaries of relevant information) for yes/no, factoid and list questions, whereas it provides only the ideal answers for summary questions. Moreover, experimental evaluations performed on biomedical questions and answers provided by the BioASQ challenge especially in 2015, 2016 and 2017 (as part of our participation), show that SemBioNLQA achieves good performances compared with the most current state-of-the-art systems and allows a practical and competitive alternative to help information seekers find exact and ideal answers to their biomedical questions.

For example, our empirical analysis on clinical research ontologies and reporting standards found little-to-no informatics-related standards. To address these issues, our study aims to leverage natural language processing techniques to discover the reporting patterns and data abstraction methodologies for EHR-based clinical research. We conducted a case study using a collection of full articles of EHR-based population studies published using the Rochester Epidemiology Project infrastructure. Our investigation discovered an upward trend of reporting EHR-related research methodologies, good practice, and the use of informatics related methods. For example, among 1279 articles, 24.0% reported training for data abstraction, 6% reported the abstractors were blinded, 4.5% tested the inter-observer agreement, 5% reported the use of a screening/data collection protocol, 1.5% reported that team meetings were organized for consensus building, and 0.8% mentioned supervision activities by senior researchers. Despite that, the overall ratio of reporting/adoption of methodologic standards was still low. There was also a high variation regarding clinical research reporting. Thus, continuously developing process frameworks, ontologies, and reporting guidelines for promoting good data practice in EHR-based clinical research are recommended.","['1 Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', '2 University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, Minneapolis, MN.', '3 Department of Information Technology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.']","Sunyang Fu, Luke A Carlson, Kevin J Peterson, Nan Wang, Xin Zhou, Suyuan Peng, Jun Jiang, Yanshan Wang, Jennifer St Sauver, Hongfang Liu, ",AMIA Joint Summits on Translational Science proceedings.

Identifying the substrate specificities of membrane transport proteins is closely related to protein-target interaction prediction, drug design, membrane recruitment, and dysregulation analysis, thus being an important problem for bioinformatics researchers. In this study, we applied word embedding approach, the main cause for natural language processing breakout in recent years, to protein sequences of transporters. We defined each protein sequence based on the word embeddings and frequencies of its biological words. The protein features were then fed into machine learning models for prediction. We also varied the lengths of protein sequence's constituent biological words to find the optimal length which generated the most discriminative feature set. Compared to four other feature types created from protein sequences, our proposed features can help prediction models yield superior performance. Our best models reach an average area under the curve of 0.96 and 0.99, respectively on the 5-fold cross validation and the independent test.

1004,Vision-referential speech enhancement of an audio signal using mask information captured as visual data,"This paper describes a vision-referential speech enhancement of an audio signal using mask information captured as visual data. Smartphones and tablet devices have become popular in recent years. Most of them not only have a microphone but also a camera. Although the frame rate of the camera in such devices is very low compared to the audio signal from the microphone, it will be useful to enhance the speech signal if both signals are used adequately. In the proposed method, the speaker broadcasts not only his/her speech signal through a loudspeaker but also its mask information through a display. The receiver can enhance the speech combining the speech signal captured by the microphone and the reference signal captured by the camera. Some experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to a typical sparse approach. It was confirmed that the speech could be enhanced even when there were different kinds of noise and a high level of real noise in the environments. Experiments were also conducted to check the sound quality of the proposed method. They were compared to clear audio data compressed with various bps mp3 format. The sound quality was sufficient for practical application.","['1 Department of Informatics, University of Electro-Communications, 1-5-1, Chofugaoka, Chofu-shi, Tokyo, 182-8585, Japan.']","Mitsuharu Matsumoto, ",The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America,2019 Jan,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30710939
1005,"How are visual words represented? Insights from EEG-based visual word decoding, feature derivation and image reconstruction","Investigations into the neural basis of reading have shed light on the cortical locus and the functional role of visual-orthographic processing. Yet, the fine-grained structure of neural representations subserving reading remains to be clarified. Here, we capitalize on the spatiotemporal structure of electroencephalography (EEG) data to examine if and how EEG patterns can serve to decode and reconstruct the internal representation of visually presented words in healthy adults. Our results show that word classification and image reconstruction were accurate well above chance, that their temporal profile exhibited an early onset, soon after 100 ms, and peaked around 170 ms. Further, reconstruction results were well explained by a combination of visual-orthographic word properties. Last, systematic individual differences were detected in orthographic representations across participants. Collectively, our results establish the feasibility of EEG-based word decoding and image reconstruction. More generally, they help to elucidate the specific features, dynamics, and neurocomputational principles underlying word recognition.","['1 Department of Psychology at Scarborough, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', '2 Rotman Research Institute, Baycrest Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', '3 BCBL, Basque Center on Cognition, Brain, and Language, Donostia, San Sebastián, Spain.']","Shouyu Ling, Andy C H Lee, Blair C Armstrong, Adrian Nestor, ",Human brain mapping,2019,EEG; multivariate analysis; reading; word processing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31403749
1006,Concept based auto-assignment of healthcare questions to domain experts in online Q&A communities,"Background:
      
    

    
      Healthcare consumers are increasingly turning to the online health Q&A communities to seek answers for their questions because current general search engines are unable to digest complex health-related questions. Q&A communities are platforms where users ask unstructured questions from different healthcare topics. Objectives:
      
    

    
      This study aimed to provide a concept-based approach to automatically assign health questions to the appropriate domain experts. Methods:
      
    

    
      We developed three processes for (1) expert profiling, (2) question analysis and (3) similarity calculation and assignment. Semantic weight of concepts combined with TF-IDF weighting comprised vectors of concepts as expert profiles. Subsequently, the similarity between submitted questions and expert profiles was calculated to find a relevant expert. Results:
      
    

    
      We randomly selected 345 questions posted by consumers for 38 experts in 13 health topics from NetWellness as input data. Our results showed the precision and recall of our proposed method for the studied topics were between 63 %-92 % and 61 %-100 %, respectively. The calculated F-measure in selected topics was between 62 % (Addiction and Substance Abuse) and 94 % (Eye and Vision Care) with a combined F-measure of 80 %. Conclusions:

1007,An overview of deep learning in medical imaging focusing on MRI,"What has happened in machine learning lately, and what does it mean for the future of medical image analysis? Machine learning has witnessed a tremendous amount of attention over the last few years. The current boom started around 2009 when so-called deep artificial neural networks began outperforming other established models on a number of important benchmarks. Deep neural networks are now the state-of-the-art machine learning models across a variety of areas, from image analysis to natural language processing, and widely deployed in academia and industry. These developments have a huge potential for medical imaging technology, medical data analysis, medical diagnostics and healthcare in general, slowly being realized. We provide a short overview of recent advances and some associated challenges in machine learning applied to medical image processing and image analysis. As this has become a very broad and fast expanding field we will not survey the entire landscape of applications, but put particular focus on deep learning in MRI. Our aim is threefold: (i) give a brief introduction to deep learning with pointers to core references; (ii) indicate how deep learning has been applied to the entire MRI processing chain, from acquisition to image retrieval, from segmentation to disease prediction; (iii) provide a starting point for people interested in experimenting and perhaps contributing to the field of deep learning for medical imaging by pointing out good educational resources, state-of-the-art open-source code, and interesting sources of data and problems related medical imaging.","['1 Mohn Medical Imaging and Visualization Centre (MMIV), Haukeland University Hospital, Norway; Department of Computing, Mathematics and Physics, Western Norway University of Applied Sciences, Norway.

      Frequency of graded response on a 5-point Likert scale to individual delirium-suggestive words. Results:
      
    

    
      Two-hundred and three complete responses were received from 227 survey respondents; the majority were medical and nursing staff (42.4% and 43.8% respectively), followed by allied health practitioners and medical coders (10.3% and 3.4%). Words that were ""very likely"" to suggest delirium were ""confused/ confusion"", ""delirious"", ""disoriented/disorientation"" and ""fluctuating conscious state"". Differences in word selection were noted based on occupational background, prior knowledge of delirium, and experience in caring for intensive care unit patients. Distractor words included in the survey were rated as ""unlikely"" or ""very unlikely"" by respondents as expected. Textual responses identified several other descriptors of delirium-suggestive words. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      A comprehensive repertoire of delirium-suggestive words was validated using a multidisciplinary survey and new words suggested by respondents were added.

1011,News media's framing of health policy and its implications for government communication: A text mining analysis of news coverage on a policy to expand health insurance coverage in South Korea,"On August 9, 2017, South Korea announced a new measure to expand National Health Insurance (NHI) coverage, which was nicknamed ""Mooncare."" At the early stage of its implementation, the interpretation of a policy by social actors influences its success and the formation of social conflicts around it. This study sought to identify the strategies for interpreting Mooncare in newspapers and government documents and examine the conflicts between them. Therefore, this study used text mining methods that are well-suited to processing large amounts of natural language data. Findings revealed that, while the conservative newspaper The Chosun Ilbo tended to highlight the financial feasibility of Mooncare, the liberal newspaper The Hankyoreh emphasized the change in rationality of government from the previous administration implied by Mooncare. Additionally, medical newspapers tended to adopt the perspective of healthcare providers and to focus on the changes in the medical system that may threaten them. In contrast, general newspapers tended to adopt the perspective of Mooncare's beneficiaries. Finally, government documents were found to focus on simply introducing the benefits of Mooncare, not responding to the framings of various media. This study identified how various social actors interpreted Mooncare. The results suggest that the government should assume a more active role in the meaning making of the policy.","['1 The Institute for Social Development and Policy Research, Seoul National University: 220-540, 1, Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, 08826, Republic of Korea; Department of Sociology, Seoul National University: 16-204, 1, Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, 08826, Republic of Korea.

      Cohort selection for clinical trials is a key step for clinical research. We proposed a hierarchical neural network to determine whether a patient satisfied selection criteria or not. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      We designed a hierarchical neural network (denoted as CNN-Highway-LSTM or LSTM-Highway-LSTM) for the track 1 of the national natural language processing (NLP) clinical challenge (n2c2) on cohort selection for clinical trials in 2018. The neural network is composed of 5 components: (1) sentence representation using convolutional neural network (CNN) or long short-term memory (LSTM) network; (2) a highway network to adjust information flow; (3) a self-attention neural network to reweight sentences; (4) document representation using LSTM, which takes sentence representations in chronological order as input; (5) a fully connected neural network to determine whether each criterion is met or not. We compared the proposed method with its variants, including the methods only using the first component to represent documents directly and the fully connected neural network for classification (denoted as CNN-only or LSTM-only) and the methods without using the highway network (denoted as CNN-LSTM or LSTM-LSTM). The performance of all methods was measured by micro-averaged precision, recall, and F1 score. Results:
      
    

    
      The micro-averaged F1 scores of CNN-only, LSTM-only, CNN-LSTM, LSTM-LSTM, CNN-Highway-LSTM, and LSTM-Highway-LSTM were 85.24%, 84.25%, 87.27%, 88.68%, 88.48%, and 90.21%, respectively. The highest micro-averaged F1 score is higher than our submitted 1 of 88.55%, which is 1 of the top-ranked results in the challenge. The results indicate that the proposed method is effective for cohort selection for clinical trials. Discussion:

To ensure that the clinicians conform to the protocols, quality assurance of these reports is needed. Patient reports are currently written in free-text format, which complicates the task of quality assurance. In this paper, we present a machine learning based natural language processing system for automatic quality assurance of radiology reports on breast cancer. This is achieved in three steps: we i) identify the top-level structure (headings) of the report, ii) classify the report content into the top-level headings, iii) convert the free-text detailed findings in the report to a semi-structured format (post-structuring). Top level structure and content of report were predicted with an F1 score of 0.97 and 0.94, respectively using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. For automatic structuring, our proposed hierarchical Conditional Random Field (CRF) outperformed the baseline CRF with an F1 score of 0.78 vs 0.71. The determined structure of the report is represented in semi-structured XML format of the free-text report, which helps to easily visualize the conformance of the findings to the protocols.

Determine the proportion of clinical data that identify these implantable devices. Methods:
      
    

    
      This Institutional Review Board-approved retrospective study was performed at a 793-bed academic hospital. The expert-derived approach used an open-source software with a list of curated terms to query for implantable devices posing high safety risk (""MRI-Red"") in patients undergoing MRI. The ontology-derived approach used an NLP system with terms mapped to Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms. Queries were performed in three clinical data types-25,000 radiology reports, 174,769 emergency department (ED) notes, and 41,085 other clinical reports (eg, cardiology, operating room, physician notes, radiology reports, pathology reports, patient letters). Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of both methods against manual review of a randomly sampled 465 reports were assessed and tested for significant differences between expert-derived and ontology-derived approaches using t test. Results:

In this context, social media platforms have begun to receive significant attention as a novel source of real-time user-reported information. However, the ability of epidemiologists to use such information is significantly stymied by the lack of publicly available algorithms and software for addiction information extraction, analysis and modeling.

1016,Text Processing for Detection of Fungal Ocular Involvement in Critical Care Patients: Cross-Sectional Study,"Background:
      
    

    
      Fungal ocular involvement can develop in patients with fungal bloodstream infections and can be vision-threatening. Ocular involvement has become less common in the current era of improved antifungal therapies. Retrospectively determining the prevalence of fungal ocular involvement is important for informing clinical guidelines, such as the need for routine ophthalmologic consultations. However, manual retrospective record review to detect cases is time-consuming. Objective:
      
    

    
      This study aimed to determine the prevalence of fungal ocular involvement in a critical care database using both structured and unstructured electronic health record (EHR) data. Methods:
      
    

    
      We queried microbiology data from 46,467 critical care patients over 12 years (2000-2012) from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) to identify 265 patients with culture-proven fungemia. For each fungemic patient, demographic data, fungal species present in blood culture, and risk factors for fungemia (eg, presence of indwelling catheters, recent major surgery, diabetes, immunosuppressed status) were ascertained. All structured diagnosis codes and free-text narrative notes associated with each patient's hospitalization were also extracted. Screening for fungal endophthalmitis was performed using two approaches: (1) by querying a wide array of eye- and vision-related diagnosis codes, and (2) by utilizing a custom regular expression pipeline to identify and collate relevant text matches pertaining to fungal ocular involvement. Both approaches were validated using manual record review. The main outcome measure was the documentation of any fungal ocular involvement. Results:
      
    

    
      In total, 265 patients had culture-proven fungemia, with Candida albicans (n=114, 43%) and Candida glabrata (n=74, 28%) being the most common fungal species in blood culture. The in-hospital mortality rate was 121 (46%). In total, 7 patients were identified as having eye- or vision-related diagnosis codes, none of whom had fungal endophthalmitis based on record review. There were 26,830 free-text narrative notes associated with these 265 patients. A regular expression pipeline based on relevant terms yielded possible matches in 683 notes from 108 patients. Subsequent manual record review again demonstrated that no patients had fungal ocular involvement. Therefore, the prevalence of fungal ocular involvement in this cohort was 0%. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      MIMIC-III contained no cases of ocular involvement among fungemic patients, consistent with prior studies reporting low rates of ocular involvement in fungemia. This study demonstrates an application of natural language processing to expedite the review of narrative notes. This approach is highly relevant for ophthalmology, where diagnoses are often based on physical examination findings that are documented within clinical notes.","['1 Viterbi Family Department of Ophthalmology and Shiley Eye Institute, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States.', '2 Division of Biomedical Informatics, Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States.', '3 Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States.', '4 Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States.']","Sally L Baxter, Adam R Klie, Bharanidharan Radha Saseendrakumar, Gordon Y Ye, Michael Hogarth, ",Journal of medical Internet research,2020,diagnosis codes; electronic health records; fungal endophthalmitis; fungal ocular involvement; fungemia; natural language processing; regular expressions; unstructured data.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32795984
1017,Application of optical character recognition with natural language processing for large-scale quality metric data extraction in colonoscopy reports,"Background and aims:
      
    

    
      Colonoscopy is commonly performed for colorectal cancer screening in the United States. Reports are often generated in a nonstandardized format and are not always integrated into electronic health records. Thus, this information is not readily available for streamlining quality management, participating in endoscopy registries, or reporting of patient and center-specific risk factors predictive of outcomes. We aim to demonstrate the use of a new hybrid approach using natural language processing of charts that have been elucidated with optical character recognition processing (OCR/NLP hybrid) to obtain relevant clinical information from scanned colonoscopy and pathology reports, a technology co-developed by Cleveland Clinic and eHealth Technologies (West Henrietta, NY, USA). Methods:
      
    

    
      This was a retrospective study conducted at Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, and the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota. A randomly sampled list of outpatient screening colonoscopy procedures and pathology reports was selected. Desired variables were then collected. Two researchers first manually reviewed the reports for the desired variables. Then the OCR/NLP algorithm was used to obtain the same variables from 3 EHRs being used at our institution: Epic (Verona, Wisc, USA), ProVation (Minneapolis, Minn, USA) used for endoscopy reporting, and Sunquest PowerPath (Tucson, Ariz, USA) used for pathology reporting. Results:
      
    

    
      When compared with manual data extraction, the hybrid OCR/NLP approach was able to detect polyps with an accuracy of 95.8%, adenomas 98.5%, sessile serrated polyps 99.3%, advanced adenomas 98%, inadequate bowel preparation 98.4% and failed cecal intubation 99%.

1018,Lifestyle Counseling and Long-term Clinical Outcomes in Patients With Diabetes,"Objective:
      
    

    
      To investigate the relationship between lifestyle counseling in primary care settings and clinical outcomes in patients with diabetes. Research design and methods:
      
    

    
      We retrospectively studied hyperglycemic adults with diabetes treated at primary care practices between 2000 and 2014. We analyzed the relationship between frequency of lifestyle counseling (identified using natural language processing of electronic notes) and a composite outcome of death and cardiovascular events during subsequent follow-up. Results:
      
    

    
      Among patients with monthly counseling or more, 10-year cumulative incidence of the primary outcome was 33.0% compared with 38.1% for less than monthly counseling (P = 0.0005). In multivariable analysis, higher frequency of lifestyle counseling was associated with lower incidence of the primary outcome (hazard ratio 0.88 [95% CI 0.82-0.94]; P < 0.001). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      More frequent lifestyle counseling was associated with a lower incidence of cardiovascular events and death among patients with diabetes.","['1 Department of Endocrinology, Key Laboratory of Endocrinology, Ministry of Health, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', ""2 Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA."", '3 Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA.', '4 Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', '5 Harvard T.H.

1020,Applying speech technologies to assess verbal memory in patients with serious mental illness,"Verbal memory deficits are some of the most profound neurocognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia and serious mental illness in general. As yet, their measurement in clinical settings is limited to traditional tests that allow for limited administrations and require substantial resources to deploy and score. Therefore, we developed a digital ambulatory verbal memory test with automated scoring, and repeated self-administration via smart devices. One hundred and four adults participated, comprising 25 patients with serious mental illness and 79 healthy volunteers. The study design was successful with high quality speech recordings produced to 92% of prompts (Patients: 86%, Healthy: 96%). The story recalls were both transcribed and scored by humans, and scores generated using natural language processing on transcriptions were comparable to human ratings (R = 0.83, within the range of human-to-human correlations of R = 0.73-0.89). A fully automated approach that scored transcripts generated by automatic speech recognition produced comparable and accurate scores (R = 0.82), with very high correlation to scores derived from human transcripts (R = 0.99). This study demonstrates the viability of leveraging speech technologies to facilitate the frequent assessment of verbal memory for clinical monitoring purposes in psychiatry.","['1 1UiT The Arctic University of Norway, Tromsø, Norway.', '2 2University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, CO USA.', '3 Pearson PLC, London, England.', '4 4Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA USA.', '5 5Analytic Measures Inc, Palo Alto, CA USA.', '6 Norwegian Centre for eHealth Research, Tromsø, Norway.']","Terje B Holmlund, Chelsea Chandler, Peter W Foltz, Alex S Cohen, Jian Cheng, Jared C Bernstein, Elizabeth P Rosenfeld, Brita Elvevåg, ",NPJ digital medicine,2020,Biomarkers; Diagnosis; Human behaviour; Language.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32195368

      To implement a system for unsupervised extraction of tumor stage and prognostic data in patients with genitourinary cancers using clinicopathological and radiology text. Methods:
      
    

    
      A corpus of 1054 electronic notes (clinician notes, radiology reports and pathology reports) was annotated for tumor stage, prostate specific antigen (PSA) and Gleason grade. Annotations from five clinicians were reconciled to form a gold standard dataset. A training dataset of 386 documents was sequestered. The Medtex algorithm was adapted using the training dataset. Results:
      
    

    
      Adapted Medtex equaled or exceeded human performance in most annotations, except for implicit M stage (F-measure of 0.69 vs 0.84) and PSA (0.92 vs 0.96). Overall Medtex performed with an F-measure of 0.86 compared to human annotations of 0.92. There was significant inter-observer variability when comparing human annotators to the gold standard. Conclusions:

1022,Bi-directional Recurrent Neural Network Models for Geographic Location Extraction in Biomedical Literature,"Phylogeography research involving virus spread and tree reconstruction relies on accurate geographic locations of infected hosts. Insufficient level of geographic information in nucleotide sequence repositories such as GenBank motivates the use of natural language processing methods for extracting geographic location names (toponyms) in the scientific article associated with the sequence, and disambiguating the locations to their co-ordinates. In this paper, we present an extensive study of multiple recurrent neural network architectures for the task of extracting geographic locations and their effective contribution to the disambiguation task using population heuristics. The methods presented in this paper achieve a strict detection F1 score of 0.94, disambiguation accuracy of 91% and an overall resolution F1 score of 0.88 that are significantly higher than previously developed methods, improving our capability to find the location of infected hosts and enrich metadata information.","['1 College of Health Solutions, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85281, USA2Biodesign Center for Environmental Health Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85281, USA.']","Arjun Magge, Davy Weissenbacher, Abeed Sarker, Matthew Scotch, Graciela Gonzalez-Hernandez, ",Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing.

1023,Combining deep learning with token selection for patient phenotyping from electronic health records,"Artificial intelligence provides the opportunity to reveal important information buried in large amounts of complex data. Electronic health records (eHRs) are a source of such big data that provide a multitude of health related clinical information about patients. However, text data from eHRs, e.g., discharge summary notes, are challenging in their analysis because these notes are free-form texts and the writing formats and styles vary considerably between different records. For this reason, in this paper we study deep learning neural networks in combination with natural language processing to analyze text data from clinical discharge summaries. We provide a detail analysis of patient phenotyping, i.e., the automatic prediction of ten patient disorders, by investigating the influence of network architectures, sample sizes and information content of tokens. Importantly, for patients suffering from Chronic Pain, the disorder that is the most difficult one to classify, we find the largest performance gain for a combined word- and sentence-level input convolutional neural network (ws-CNN). As a general result, we find that the combination of data quality and data quantity of the text data is playing a crucial role for using more complex network architectures that improve significantly beyond a word-level input CNN model. From our investigations of learning curves and token selection mechanisms, we conclude that for such a transition one requires larger sample sizes because the amount of information per sample is quite small and only carried by few tokens and token categories. Interestingly, we found that the token frequency in the eHRs follow a Zipf law and we utilized this behavior to investigate the information content of tokens by defining a token selection mechanism. The latter addresses also issues of explainable AI.","['1 Predictive Society and Data Analytics Lab, Tampere University, Tampere, Korkeakoulunkatu 10, 33720, Tampere, Finland.', '2 Steyr School of Management, University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria, 4400, Steyr Campus, Austria.', '3 College of Artificial Intelligence, Nankai University, Tianjin, 300350, China.', '4 Department of Biomedical Computer Science and Mechatronics, UMIT-The Health and Life Science University, 6060, Hall in Tyrol, Austria.', '5 Computational Systems Biology Lab, Tampere University, Korkeakoulunkatu 10, 33720, Tampere, Finland.', '6 Institute of Biosciences and Medical Technology, Tampere University, Tampere, Korkeakoulunkatu 10, 33720, Tampere, Finland.', '7 Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle, WA, 98109, USA.', '8 Predictive Society and Data Analytics Lab, Tampere University, Tampere, Korkeakoulunkatu 10, 33720, Tampere, Finland. v@bio-complexity.com.', '9 Institute of Biosciences and Medical Technology, Tampere University, Tampere, Korkeakoulunkatu 10, 33720, Tampere, Finland. v@bio-complexity.com.']","Zhen Yang, Matthias Dehmer, Olli Yli-Harja, Frank Emmert-Streib, ",Scientific reports,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31996705
1024,Constrained Structure of Ancient Chinese Poetry Facilitates Speech Content Grouping,"Ancient Chinese poetry is constituted by structured language that deviates from ordinary language usage [1, 2]; its poetic genres impose unique combinatory constraints on linguistic elements [3]. How does the constrained poetic structure facilitate speech segmentation when common linguistic [4-8] and statistical cues [5, 9] are unreliable to listeners in poems? We generated artificial Jueju, which arguably has the most constrained structure in ancient Chinese poetry, and presented each poem twice as an isochronous sequence of syllables to native Mandarin speakers while conducting magnetoencephalography (MEG) recording. We found that listeners deployed their prior knowledge of Jueju to build the line structure and to establish the conceptual flow of Jueju. Unprecedentedly, we found a phase precession phenomenon indicating predictive processes of speech segmentation-the neural phase advanced faster after listeners acquired knowledge of incoming speech. The statistical co-occurrence of monosyllabic words in Jueju negatively correlated with speech segmentation, which provides an alternative perspective on how statistical cues facilitate speech segmentation. Our findings suggest that constrained poetic structures serve as a temporal map for listeners to group speech contents and to predict incoming speech signals. Listeners can parse speech streams by using not only grammatical and statistical cues but also their prior knowledge of the form of language.

1025,Low-frequency cortical responses to natural speech reflect probabilistic phonotactics,"Humans comprehend speech despite the various challenges such as mispronunciation and noisy environments. Our auditory system is robust to these thanks to the integration of the sensory input with prior knowledge and expectations built on language-specific regularities. One such regularity regards the permissible phoneme sequences, which determine the likelihood that a word belongs to a given language (phonotactic probability; ""blick"" is more likely to be an English word than ""bnick""). Previous research demonstrated that violations of these rules modulate brain-evoked responses. However, several fundamental questions remain unresolved, especially regarding the neural encoding and integration strategy of phonotactics in naturalistic conditions, when there are no (or few) violations. Here, we used linear modelling to assess the influence of phonotactic probabilities on the brain responses to narrative speech measured with non-invasive EEG. We found that the relationship between continuous speech and EEG responses is best described when the stimulus descriptor includes phonotactic probabilities. This indicates that low-frequency cortical signals (<9 Hz) reflect the integration of phonotactic information during natural speech perception, providing us with a measure of phonotactic processing at the individual subject-level. Furthermore, phonotactics-related signals showed the strongest speech-EEG interactions at latencies of 100-500 ms, supporting a pre-lexical role of phonotactic information.","[""1 Laboratoire des Systèmes Perceptifs, UMR 8248, CNRS, France; Département d'Etudes Cognitives, Ecole Normale Supérieure, PSL University, France.

1026,Identifying Key Target Audiences for Public Health Campaigns: Leveraging Machine Learning in the Case of Hookah Tobacco Smoking,"Background:
      
    

    
      Hookah tobacco smoking (HTS) is a particularly important issue for public health professionals to address owing to its prevalence and deleterious health effects. Social media sites can be a valuable tool for public health officials to conduct informational health campaigns. Current social media platforms provide researchers with opportunities to better identify and target specific audiences and even individuals. However, we are not aware of systematic research attempting to identify audiences with mixed or ambivalent views toward HTS. Objective:
      
    

    
      The objective of this study was to (1) confirm previous research showing positively skewed HTS sentiment on Twitter using a larger dataset by leveraging machine learning techniques and (2) systematically identify individuals who exhibit mixed opinions about HTS via the Twitter platform and therefore represent key audiences for intervention. Methods:
      
    

    
      We prospectively collected tweets related to HTS from January to June 2016. We double-coded sentiment for a subset of approximately 5000 randomly sampled tweets for sentiment toward HTS and used these data to train a machine learning classifier to assess the remaining approximately 556,000 HTS-related Twitter posts. Natural language processing software was used to extract linguistic features (ie, language-based covariates). The data were processed by machine learning tools and algorithms using R. Finally, we used the results to identify individuals who, because they had consistently posted both positive and negative content, might be ambivalent toward HTS and represent an ideal audience for intervention. Results:
      
    

    
      There were 561,960 HTS-related tweets: 373,911 were classified as positive and 183,139 were classified as negative. A set of 12,861 users met a priori criteria indicating that they posted both positive and negative tweets about HTS. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Sentiment analysis can allow researchers to identify audience segments on social media that demonstrate ambiguity toward key public health issues, such as HTS, and therefore represent ideal populations for intervention. Using large social media datasets can help public health officials to preemptively identify specific audience segments that would be most receptive to targeted campaigns.","['1 School of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, United States.', '2 Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, United States.']","Kar-Hai Chu, Jason Colditz, Momin Malik, Tabitha Yates, Brian Primack, ",Journal of medical Internet research,2019,infodemiology; infoveillance; machine learning; public health; smoking; smoking water pipes; social media; tobacco; waterpipe tobacco.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31287063
1027,Identifying SNAREs by Incorporating Deep Learning Architecture and Amino Acid Embedding Representation,"SNAREs (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor activating protein receptors) are a group of proteins that are crucial for membrane fusion and exocytosis of neurotransmitters from the cell. They play an important role in a broad range of cell processes, including cell growth, cytokinesis, and synaptic transmission, to promote cell membrane integration in eukaryotes. Many studies determined that SNARE proteins have been associated with a lot of human diseases, especially in cancer. Therefore, identifying their functions is a challenging problem for scientists to better understand the cancer disease as well as design the drug targets for treatment. We described each protein sequence based on the amino acid embeddings using fastText, which is a natural language processing model performing well in its field. Because each protein sequence is similar to a sentence with different words, applying language model into protein sequence is challenging and promising. After generating, the amino acid embedding features were fed into a deep learning algorithm for prediction. Our model which combines fastText model and deep convolutional neural networks could identify SNARE proteins with an independent test accuracy of 92.8%, sensitivity of 88.5%, specificity of 97%, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.86. Our performance results were superior to the state-of-the-art predictor (SNARE-CNN). We suggest this study as a reliable method for biologists for SNARE identification and it serves a basis for applying fastText word embedding model into bioinformatics, especially in protein sequencing prediction.","['1 Professional Master Program in Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', '2 Department of Electrical Electronic and Mechanical Engineering, Lac Hong University, Bien Hoa, Vietnam.', '3 Department of Electrical Engineering, Yuan Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.']","Nguyen Quoc Khanh Le, Tuan-Tu Huynh, ",Frontiers in physiology,2019,SNARE proteins; convolutional neural networks; deep learning; skip-gram; word embedding.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31920706
1028,QAnalysis: a question-answer driven analytic tool on knowledge graphs for leveraging electronic medical records for clinical research,"Background:
      
    

    
      While doctors should analyze a large amount of electronic medical record (EMR) data to conduct clinical research, the analyzing process requires information technology (IT) skills, which is difficult for most doctors in China. Methods:
      
    

    
      In this paper, we build a novel tool QAnalysis, where doctors enter their analytic requirements in their natural language and then the tool returns charts and tables to the doctors. For a given question from a user, we first segment the sentence, and then we use grammar parser to analyze the structure of the sentence. After linking the segmentations to concepts and predicates in knowledge graphs, we convert the question into a set of triples connected with different kinds of operators. These triples are converted to queries in Cypher, the query language for Neo4j. Finally, the query is executed on Neo4j, and the results shown in terms of tables and charts are returned to the user. Results:
      
    

    
      The tool supports top 50 questions we gathered from two hospital departments with the Delphi method. We also gathered 161 questions from clinical research papers with statistical requirements on EMR data. Experimental results show that our tool can directly cover 78.20% of these statistical questions and the precision is as high as 96.36%. Such extension is easy to achieve with the help of knowledge-graph technology we have adopted. The recorded demo can be accessed from https://github.com/NLP-BigDataLab/QAnalysis-project .

1030,Follow Up of Incidental High-Risk Pulmonary Nodules on Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography at Care Transitions,"Background:
      
    

    
      Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) detects incidental findings that require follow-up. In just over 50% of cases, those incidental findings are pulmonary nodules. Fleischner guidelines recommend that patients with nodules that have a high risk of malignancy should undergo CT follow-up within 3-12 months. Objective:
      
    

    
      We examined the proportion of patients with pulmonary nodules requiring follow up who received repeat imaging within six weeks of the time frame recommended by the radiologist. Design:
      
    

    
      This retrospective cohort study included all patients who underwent CTPA in the emergency department and inpatient settings at three teaching hospitals in Toronto, Canada between September 1, 2014, and August 31, 2015. Natural language processing software was applied to a linked radiology information system to identify all CTPAs that contained pulmonary nodules. Using manual review and prespecified exclusion criteria, we generated a cohort with possible new lung malignancy eligible for follow-up imaging; then we reviewed available health records to determine whether follow-up had occurred. Results:
      
    

    
      Of the 1,910 CTPAs performed over the study period, 674 (35.3%) contained pulmonary nodules. Of the 259 patients with new nodules eligible for follow-up imaging, 65 received an explicit suggestion for follow-up by radiology (25.1%). Of these 65 patients, 35 (53.8%) did not receive repeat imaging within the recommended time frame. Explicit mention that follow-up was required in the discharge summary (P = .03), attending an outpatient follow-up visit (P < .001), and younger age (P = .03) were associated with receiving timely follow-up imaging.

1031,Thyroid Function Screening in Children and Adolescents With Mood and Anxiety Disorders,"Objective:
      
    

    
      To determine the prevalence of abnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measures in youth with severe mood and anxiety disorders and to examine clinical and demographic predictors of abnormal TSH measures. Methods:
      
    

    
      We retrospectively examined screening TSH concentrations in psychiatrically hospitalized children and adolescents (3-19 years) with mood/anxiety disorders (DSM-IV and DSM-5 criteria) at a large, urban, pediatric hospital between September 2013 and April 2017. Symptoms were extracted from the medical record using adaptive natural language processing algorithms, and the utility of demographic, clinical, and treatment variables as predictors of abnormal TSH measures was evaluated using logistic regression. Results:
      
    

    
      In this sample (N = 1,017, mean ± SD age = 14.7 ± 2.24 years), 62 patients had a TSH concentration > 3.74 μIU/mL (5.3% [n = 6] of patients < 12 years of age and 6.2% [n = 56] of patients ≥ 12 years of age), and 7 patients had a TSH concentration < 0.36 μIU/mL. Elevated TSH concentrations were associated with a recent weight gain (odds ratio [OR] = 3.60; 95% CI, 1.13-9.61; P = .017), a history of thyroid disease (OR = 6.88; 95% CI, 2.37-10.7; P ≤ .0001), abnormal menstrual bleeding/menometrorrhagia (OR = 2.03; CI, 1.04-3.63; P = .024), and benzodiazepine treatment (OR = 2.29; 95% CI, 1.07-4.52; P = .02). No association was observed for sex, age, or body mass index z score. Among patients with elevated TSH measures, 12.9% (n = 8, mean ± SD age = 16.5 ± 1.5 years, 87.5% female) had an abnormal free/total thyroxine (T₄) level or other biochemical findings consistent with thyroid disease. Patients with thyroid disease (compared to those patients with elevated TSH and normal active thyroid hormone concentrations) were older (16.5 ± 1.5 vs 14.6 ± 2.3 years, P = .020) but did not differ in sex distribution (87.5% vs 63.6% female, P = .444).

1032,RegulonDB v 10.5: tackling challenges to unify classic and high throughput knowledge of gene regulation in E. coli K-12,"RegulonDB, first published 20 years ago, is a comprehensive electronic resource about regulation of transcription initiation of Escherichia coli K-12 with decades of knowledge from classic molecular biology experiments, and recently also from high-throughput genomic methodologies. We curated the literature to keep RegulonDB up to date, and initiated curation of ChIP and gSELEX experiments. We estimate that current knowledge describes between 10% and 30% of the expected total number of transcription factor- gene regulatory interactions in E. coli. RegulonDB provides datasets for interactions for which there is no evidence that they affect expression, as well as expression datasets. We developed a proof of concept pipeline to merge binding and expression evidence to identify regulatory interactions. These datasets can be visualized in the RegulonDB JBrowse. We developed the Microbial Conditions Ontology with a controlled vocabulary for the minimal properties to reproduce an experiment, which contributes to integrate data from high throughput and classic literature. At a higher level of integration, we report Genetic Sensory-Response Units for 200 transcription factors, including their regulation at the metabolic level, and include summaries for 70 of them. Finally, we summarize our research with Natural language processing strategies to enhance our biocuration work.","['1 Centro de Ciencias Genómicas, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Cuernavaca, Morelos 62210, México.', '2 Department of Biomedical Engineering, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA.']","Alberto Santos-Zavaleta, Heladia Salgado, Socorro Gama-Castro, Mishael Sánchez-Pérez, Laura Gómez-Romero, Daniela Ledezma-Tejeida, Jair Santiago García-Sotelo, Kevin Alquicira-Hernández, Luis José Muñiz-Rascado, Pablo Peña-Loredo, Cecilia Ishida-Gutiérrez, David A Velázquez-Ramírez, Víctor Del Moral-Chávez, César Bonavides-Martínez, Carlos-Francisco Méndez-Cruz, James Galagan, Julio Collado-Vides, ",Nucleic acids research,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30395280

1034,"Semantic memory for objects, actions, and events: A novel test of event-related conceptual semantic knowledge","People possess significant knowledge about how real-world events typically unfold. Such event-related semantic memory connects action and object knowledge, is essential for multiple stages of language processing, and may be impaired in neurological conditions like aphasia. However, current assessments are not well designed for measuring this knowledge. This study presents and tests a novel measure of event-related semantic memory. Task-performance data were collected from unimpaired adults across the lifespan and a sample of stroke survivors with aphasia. Individuals with aphasia also completed measures of language processing and action-/object-related semantic memory, to establish the novel measure's convergent validity. Results demonstrate that performance on the event-knowledge measure correlated with action and object semantic-memory measures and was also associated with a broader range of language-processing performance than other semantic-memory measures. These findings suggest that the novel measure can be used to detect the presence and impact of event-knowledge impairments in neurological conditions.","['1 Department of Communication Science and Disorders, School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', '2 VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', '3 Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', '4 Learning Research and Development Center, Kenneth P.

1035,Extraction of temporal relations from clinical free text: A systematic review of current approaches,"Background:
      
    

    
      Temporal relations between clinical events play an important role in clinical assessment and decision making. Extracting such relations from free text data is a challenging task because it lies on between medical natural language processing, temporal representation and temporal reasoning. Objectives:
      
    

    
      To survey existing methods for extracting temporal relations (TLINKs) between events from clinical free text in English; to establish the state-of-the-art in this field; and to identify outstanding methodological challenges. Methods:
      
    

    
      A systematic search in PubMed and the DBLP computer science bibliography was conducted for studies published between January 2006 and December 2018. The relevant studies were identified by examining the titles and abstracts. Then, the full text of selected studies was analyzed in depth and information were collected on TLINK tasks, TLINK types, data sources, features selection, methods used, and reported performance. Results:
      
    

    
      A total of 2834 publications were identified for title and abstract screening. Of these publications, 51 studies were selected. Thirty-two studies used machine learning approaches, 15 studies used a hybrid approaches, and only four studies used a rule-based approach. The majority of studies use publicly available corpora: THYME (28 studies) and the i2b2 corpus (17 studies). Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The performance of TLINK extraction methods ranges widely depending on relation types and events (e.g. from 32% to 87% F-score for identifying relations between clinical events and document creation time). A small set of TLINKs (before, after, overlap and contains) has been widely studied with relatively good performance, whereas other types of TLINK (e.g., started by, finished by, precedes) are rarely studied and remain challenging. Machine learning classifiers (such as Support Vector Machine and Conditional Random Fields) and Deep Neural Networks were among the best performing methods for extracting TLINKs, but nearly all the work has been carried out and tested on two publicly available corpora only. The field would benefit from the availability of more publicly available, high-quality, annotated clinical text corpora.","['1 Department of Computer Science, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK; Department of Computer Science, Jamoum University College, Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah, Saudi Arabia.

1036,Near-infrared spectroscopy reveals neural perception of vocal emotions in human neonates,"Processing affective prosody, that is the emotional tone of a speaker, is fundamental to human communication and adaptive behaviors. Previous studies have mainly focused on adults and infants; thus the neural mechanisms underlying the processing of affective prosody in newborns remain unclear. Here, we used near-infrared spectroscopy to examine the ability of 0-to-4-day-old neonates to discriminate emotions conveyed by speech prosody in their maternal language and a foreign language. Happy, fearful, and angry prosodies enhanced neural activation in the right superior temporal gyrus relative to neutral prosody in the maternal but not the foreign language. Happy prosody elicited greater activation than negative prosody in the left superior frontal gyrus and the left angular gyrus, regions that have not been associated with affective prosody processing in infants or adults. These findings suggest that sensitivity to affective prosody is formed through prenatal exposure to vocal stimuli of the maternal language. Furthermore, the sensitive neural correlates appeared more distributed in neonates than infants, indicating a high-level of neural specialization between the neonatal stage and early infancy. Finally, neonates showed preferential neural responses to positive over negative prosody, which is contrary to the ""negativity bias"" phenomenon established in adult and infant studies.","['1 College of Psychology and Sociology, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China.', '2 Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Affective and Social Cognitive Science, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China.', '3 Department of Pediatrics, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China.', '4 Faculty of Foreign Languages, Ningbo University, Ningbo, China.']","Dandan Zhang, Yu Chen, Xinlin Hou, Yan Jing Wu, ",Human brain mapping,2019,affective prosody; angular gyrus; inferior frontal gyrus; neonate; positivity preference; superior temporal gyrus.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30697881
1037,Effect of a Report Template-Enabled Quality Improvement Initiative on Use of Preferred Phrases for Communicating Normal Findings in Structured Abdominal CT and MRI Reports,"OBJECTIVE. The objective of this study was to assess impact of a report template quality improvement (QI) initiative on use of preferred phrases for communicating normal findings in structured abdominal CT and MRI reports. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. This prospective QI initiative, designed to decrease use of equivocal phrases and increase use of preferred and acceptable phrases (defined by multidisciplinary experts including patient advocates) in radiology reports, was performed in an academic medical center with over 800,000 annual radiologic examinations and was exempt from institutional review board approval. The intervention populated the preferred term ""normal"" (default) and acceptable specified pertinent negative phrases (pick-list option) when describing abdominal organ subheadings (liver, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys) within the ""Findings"" heading of abdominal CT and MRI report templates. We tabulated frequencies of the term ""normal"", specified pertinent negatives, and equivocal phrases in 21,629 reports before (June 1, 2017, to February 28, 2018) and 23,051 reports after (April 1, 2018, to December 31, 2018) the intervention using natural language processing and recorded trainee participation in report generation. We assessed intervention impact using statistical process control (SPC) charts and the Fisher exact test. RESULTS. Equivocal phrases were used less frequently in abdominal CT and MRI reports for both attending radiologists and trainees after the intervention (p < 0.05, SPC). Use of the term ""normal"" increased for reports generated by attending radiologists alone but decreased for reports created with trainee participation (p < 0.05, SPC). Frequency of pertinent negatives increased for reports with trainee participation (p < 0.05, SPC). CONCLUSION. A QI intervention decreased use of equivocal terms and increased use of preferred and acceptable phrases when communicating normal findings in abdominal CT and MRI reports.","[""1 Center for Evidence-Based Imaging, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", ""2 Department of Radiology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115."", '3 Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.']","David P Alper, Atul B Shinagare, Seyed Raein Hashemi, Daniel I Glazer, Pamela J DiPiro, Giles W Boland, Ramin Khorasani, ",AJR.

1038,Assessing the accuracy of machine-assisted abstract screening with DistillerAI: a user study,"Background:
      
    

    
      Web applications that employ natural language processing technologies to support systematic reviewers during abstract screening have become more common. The goal of our project was to conduct a case study to explore a screening approach that temporarily replaces a human screener with a semi-automated screening tool. Methods:
      
    

    
      We evaluated the accuracy of the approach using DistillerAI as a semi-automated screening tool. A published comparative effectiveness review served as the reference standard. Five teams of professional systematic reviewers screened the same 2472 abstracts in parallel. Each team trained DistillerAI with 300 randomly selected abstracts that the team screened dually. For all remaining abstracts, DistillerAI replaced one human screener and provided predictions about the relevance of records. A single reviewer also screened all remaining abstracts. A second human screener resolved conflicts between the single reviewer and DistillerAI. We compared the decisions of the machine-assisted approach, single-reviewer screening, and screening with DistillerAI alone against the reference standard. Results:
      
    

    
      The combined sensitivity of the machine-assisted screening approach across the five screening teams was 78% (95% confidence interval [CI], 66 to 90%), and the combined specificity was 95% (95% CI, 92 to 97%). By comparison, the sensitivity of single-reviewer screening was similar (78%; 95% CI, 66 to 89%); however, the sensitivity of DistillerAI alone was substantially worse (14%; 95% CI, 0 to 31%) than that of the machine-assisted screening approach. Specificities for single-reviewer screening and DistillerAI were 94% (95% CI, 91 to 97%) and 98% (95% CI, 97 to 100%), respectively. Machine-assisted screening and single-reviewer screening had similar areas under the curve (0.87 and 0.86, respectively); by contrast, the area under the curve for DistillerAI alone was just slightly better than chance (0.56). The interrater agreement between human screeners and DistillerAI with a prevalence-adjusted kappa was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.84 to 0.86%). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The accuracy of DistillerAI is not yet adequate to replace a human screener temporarily during abstract screening for systematic reviews. Rapid reviews, which do not require detecting the totality of the relevant evidence, may find semi-automation tools to have greater utility than traditional systematic reviews.","['1 RTI International-University of North Carolina Evidence-based Practice Center, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA. ggartlehner@rti.org.', '2 Department for Evidence-based Medicine and Evaluation, Danube University Krems, Krems, Austria. ggartlehner@rti.org.', '3 Department for Evidence-based Medicine and Evaluation, Danube University Krems, Krems, Austria.', '4 RTI International-University of North Carolina Evidence-based Practice Center, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA.', '5 Department of Family Medicine, Care and Public Health Research Institute (CAPHRI), Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands.']","Gerald Gartlehner, Gernot Wagner, Linda Lux, Lisa Affengruber, Andreea Dobrescu, Angela Kaminski-Hartenthaler, Meera Viswanathan, ",Systematic reviews,2019,Accuracy; Machine-learning; Methods study; Rapid reviews; Systematic reviews.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31727159

Measuring word recognition in reading: eye movements and event-related potentials. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 7(11), 489-493) illustrated how ""by means of review and comparison"" eye movement (EM) and event-related potential (ERP) studies may advance our understanding of visual word recognition. Attempts to simultaneously record EMs and ERPs soon followed. Recently, this co-registration approach has also been transferred to fMRI and oscillatory EEG. With experimental settings close to natural reading, co-registration enables us to directly integrate insights from EM and neuroimaging studies. This should extend current experimental paradigms by moving the field towards studying sentence-level processing including effects of context and parafoveal preview. This article will introduce the basic principles and applications of co-registration and selectively review how this approach may shed light on one of the most controversially discussed issues in reading research, contextual predictions in online language processing.","['1 Centre for Cognitive Neuroscience, University of Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.', ""2 Department of Neuroimaging, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.""]","Nicole A Himmelstoss, Sarah Schuster, Florian Hutzler, Rosalyn Moran, Stefan Hawelka, ","Language, cognition and neuroscience",2019,Co-registration; contextual predictions; eye movements; fixation-related; natural reading; neuroimaging.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32656295

      Assess the early voluntary adoption of a certainty scale to improve communicating diagnostic certainty in radiology reports. Methods:
      
    

    
      This institutional review board-approved study was part of a multifaceted initiative to improve radiology report quality at a tertiary academic hospital. A committee comprised of radiology subspecialty division representatives worked to develop recommendations for communicating varying degrees of diagnostic certainty in radiology reports in the form of a certainty scale, made publicly available online, which specified the terms recommended and to be avoided in radiology reports. Twelve radiologists voluntarily piloted the scale; use was not mandatory. We assessed proportion of recommended terms among all diagnostic certainty terms in the Impression section (primary outcome) of all reports generated by the radiologists. Certainty terms were extracted via natural language processing over a 22-week postintervention period (31,399 reports) and compared with the same 22 calendar weeks 1 year pre-intervention (24,244 reports), using Fisher's exact test and statistical process control charts. Results:
      
    

    
      Overall, the proportion of recommended terms significantly increased from 8,498 of 10,650 (80.0%) pre-intervention to 9,646 of 11,239 (85.8%) postintervention (P < .0001 and by statistical process control). The proportion of recommended terms significantly increased for 8 of 12 radiologists (P < .0005 each), increased insignificantly for 3 (P > .05), and decreased without significance for 1 radiologist. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Designing and implementing a certainty scale was associated with increased voluntary use of recommended certainty terms in a small radiologist cohort.

1041,A Method of Short Text Representation Based on the Feature Probability Embedded Vector,"Text representation is one of the key tasks in the field of natural language processing (NLP). Traditional feature extraction and weighting methods often use the bag-of-words (BoW) model, which may lead to a lack of semantic information as well as the problems of high dimensionality and high sparsity. At present, to solve these problems, a popular idea is to utilize deep learning methods. In this paper, feature weighting, word embedding, and topic models are combined to propose an unsupervised text representation method named the feature, probability, and word embedding method. The main idea is to use the word embedding technology Word2Vec to obtain the word vector, and then combine this with the feature weighted TF-IDF and the topic model LDA. Compared with traditional feature engineering, the proposed method not only increases the expressive ability of the vector space model, but also reduces the dimensions of the document vector. Besides this, it can be used to solve the problems of the insufficient information, high dimensions, and high sparsity of BoW. We use the proposed method for the task of text categorization and verify the validity of the method.","['1 School of Information Science and Technology, Northeast Normal University, Changchun 130117, China.', '2 School of Information Science and Technology, Northeast Normal University, Changchun 130117, China. sunhg889@nenu.edu.cn.', '3 School of Information Science and Technology, Northeast Normal University, Changchun 130117, China. suntl@nenu.edu.cn.', '4 Department\xa0of\xa0General\xa0Computer, College of Humanities and Science of Northeast Normal University, Changchun 130117, China. suntl@nenu.edu.cn.']","Wanting Zhou, Hanbin Wang, Hongguang Sun, Tieli Sun, ","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019,feature weighting; latent Dirichlet allocation; text representation; word embedding.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31466389

      Palliative care consultation during serious life-limiting illness can reduce symptom burden and improve quality of care. However, quantifying the impact of palliative care is hindered by the limitations of manual chart review and administrative coding. Objectives:
      
    

    
      Using novel natural language process (NLP) techniques, we examined associations between palliative care consultations and performance on nationally endorsed metrics for high-quality end-of-life (EOL) care in patients with leptomeningeal disease (LMD) secondary to metastatic breast cancer. Methods:
      
    

    
      Patients with breast cancer with LMD were identified using administrative billing codes and NLP review of magnetic resonance imaging reports at 2 tertiary care centers between 2010 and 2016. Next, NLP was used to review clinical notes to (1) determine the presence of palliative care consultations and (2) determine the performance of process measures associated with high-quality EOL care, including discussions of goals of care, code status limitations, and hospice. Associations between palliative care consultation and documentation of EOL process measures were assessed using logistic regression. Results:
      
    

    
      We identified 183 cases of LMD. Median age was 56 (interquartile range [IQR]: 46-64) years and median survival was 150 days (IQR: 67-350). Within 6 months of diagnosis, 88.5% of patients had documentation of ≥1 process measure, including discussions of goals of care (63.4%), code status limitations (62.8%), or hospice (72.1%). Palliative care consultation was a predictor of subsequent documentation of goals of care (odds ratio [OR], 3.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.58-6.27) and hospice discussions (OR, 4.61; 95% CI, 2.12-10.03).

1043,DEEPred: Automated Protein Function Prediction with Multi-task Feed-forward Deep Neural Networks,"Automated protein function prediction is critical for the annotation of uncharacterized protein sequences, where accurate prediction methods are still required. Recently, deep learning based methods have outperformed conventional algorithms in computer vision and natural language processing due to the prevention of overfitting and efficient training. Here, we propose DEEPred, a hierarchical stack of multi-task feed-forward deep neural networks, as a solution to Gene Ontology (GO) based protein function prediction. DEEPred was optimized through rigorous hyper-parameter tests, and benchmarked using three types of protein descriptors, training datasets with varying sizes and GO terms form different levels. Furthermore, in order to explore how training with larger but potentially noisy data would change the performance, electronically made GO annotations were also included in the training process. The overall predictive performance of DEEPred was assessed using CAFA2 and CAFA3 challenge datasets, in comparison with the state-of-the-art protein function prediction methods. Finally, we evaluated selected novel annotations produced by DEEPred with a literature-based case study considering the 'biofilm formation process' in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This study reports that deep learning algorithms have significant potential in protein function prediction; particularly when the source data is large. The neural network architecture of DEEPred can also be applied to the prediction of the other types of ontological associations.

Clinical notes included physician-written discharge summaries (n = 51,201) and nursing notes (n = 412,343). We first used physician-written discharge summaries to train the system's algorithm and then added nursing notes to the physician-written discharge summaries and evaluated algorithms prediction accuracy. Adding nursing notes to the physician-written discharge summaries resulted in almost two-fold vocabulary expansion. NimbleMiner slightly outperformed other state-of-the-art NLP systems (average F-score = .84), while requiring significantly less time for the algorithms development.: Our findings underline the importance of nursing data for the analysis of electronic patient records.","['1 School of Nursing, Columbia University, New York City, NY, USA.', '2 Data Science Institute, Columbia University, New York City, NY, USA.', '3 Cheryl Spencer Department of Nursing, University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel.', '4 Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York City, NY, USA.']","Maxim Topaz, Ludmila Murga, Ofrit Bar-Bachar, Kenrick Cato, Sarah Collins, ",Studies in health technology and informatics,2019,Alcoholism; Nursing informatics; Substance-Related disorders.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31438086

In particular, different approaches of representing and utilizing organic molecules will be discussed - providing synthetic chemists both with the understanding and the tools required to apply machine learning in the context of their research, and pointers for further studying.","['1 Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster, Organisch-Chemisches Institut, Corrensstr. 40, 48149 Münster, Germany. marwin.segler@uni-muenster.de glorius@uni-muenster.de.']","Felix Strieth-Kalthoff, Frederik Sandfort, Marwin H S Segler, Frank Glorius, ",Chemical Society reviews,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32672294
1046,Findings from the 2019 International Medical Informatics Association Yearbook Section on Health Information Management,"Objectives:
      
    

    
      To summarize the recent literature and research and present a selection of the best papers published in 2018 in the field of Health Information Management (HIM) and Health Informatics. Methods:
      
    

    
      A systematic review of the literature was performed, with the help of a medical librarian, by the two editors of the HIM section of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Yearbook. In order to include papers that would address the special theme of the 2019 Yearbook on artificial intelligence (AI) as well as HIM, we searched bibliographic databases for HIM-related papers with an AI focus using both Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) descriptors and keywords in titles and abstracts. A shortlist of 15 candidate best papers was first selected by section editors before being peer-reviewed by independent external reviewers. Results:
      
    

    
      While there were a significant number of manuscripts that addressed issues relevant to HIM, there were virtually none with MeSH headings indicating an HIM focus. Manuscripts that were considered related to the HIM field in terms of the practice of health information management as well as the profession included those that examined using machine learning and other AI approaches to identify protected health information in clinical text to aid with de-identification, automated coding approaches to translate free-text into standardized codes, and natural language processing approaches to extract clinical data to assist with populating cancer and other registries. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The papers discussed in the HIM section reflect the special theme of the use of AI in healthcare on issues particularly relevant to the field of HIM. This synopsis discusses these papers and recommends that HIM practitioners be more involved in research and that researchers in AI and related areas recognize the applicability and relevance of their work to the field of HIM.","['1 Premier healthcare alliance, Washington, DC, USA.', '2 Graduate Programs in Health Informatics, Department of Health Services Administration, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA.']","Meryl Bloomrosen, Eta S Berner, Section Editors for the IMIA Yearbook Section on Health Information Management, ",Yearbook of medical informatics,2019 Aug,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31419817
1047,The Development of the Military Service Identification Tool: Identifying Military Veterans in a Clinical Research Database Using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning,"Background:
      
    

    
      Electronic health care records (EHRs) are a rich source of health-related information, with potential for secondary research use. In the United Kingdom, there is no national marker for identifying those who have previously served in the Armed Forces, making analysis of the health and well-being of veterans using EHRs difficult. Objective:
      
    

    
      This study aimed to develop a tool to identify veterans from free-text clinical documents recorded in a psychiatric EHR database. Methods:
      
    

    
      Veterans were manually identified using the South London and Maudsley (SLaM) Biomedical Research Centre Clinical Record Interactive Search-a database holding secondary mental health care electronic records for the SLaM National Health Service Foundation Trust. An iterative approach was taken; first, a structured query language (SQL) method was developed, which was then refined using natural language processing and machine learning to create the Military Service Identification Tool (MSIT) to identify if a patient was a civilian or veteran. Performance, defined as correct classification of veterans compared with incorrect classification, was measured using positive predictive value, negative predictive value, sensitivity, F1 score, and accuracy (otherwise termed Youden Index). Results:
      
    

    
      A gold standard dataset of 6672 free-text clinical documents was manually annotated by human coders. Of these documents, 66.00% (4470/6672) were then used to train the SQL and MSIT approaches and 34.00% (2202/6672) were used for testing the approaches. To develop the MSIT, an iterative 2-stage approach was undertaken. In the first stage, an SQL method was developed to identify veterans using a keyword rule-based approach. This approach obtained an accuracy of 0.93 in correctly predicting civilians and veterans, a positive predictive value of 0.81, a sensitivity of 0.75, and a negative predictive value of 0.95. This method informed the second stage, which was the development of the MSIT using machine learning, which, when tested, obtained an accuracy of 0.97, a positive predictive value of 0.90, a sensitivity of 0.91, and a negative predictive value of 0.98. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The MSIT has the potential to be used in identifying veterans in the United Kingdom from free-text clinical documents, providing new and unique insights into the health and well-being of this population and their use of mental health care services.","[""1 King's Centre for Military Health Research, King's College London, London, United Kingdom."", ""2 Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, United Kingdom."", '3 South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom.', '4 Combat Stress, Letherhead, United Kingdom.', ""5 Academic Department of Military Mental Health, King's College London, London, United Kingdom."", ""6 Department of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, United Kingdom.""]","Daniel Leightley, David Pernet, Sumithra Velupillai, Robert J Stewart, Katharine M Mark, Elena Opie, Dominic Murphy, Nicola T Fear, Sharon A M Stevelink, ",JMIR medical informatics,2020,electronic health care records; machine learning; mental health; military personnel; natural language processing; veteran.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32348287
1048,"Work effort, readability and quality of pharmacy transcription of patient directions from electronic prescriptions: a retrospective observational cohort analysis","Background:
      
    

    
      Free-text directions generated by prescribers in electronic prescriptions can be difficult for patients to understand due to their variability, complexity and ambiguity. Pharmacy staff are responsible for transcribing these directions so that patients can take their medication as prescribed. However, little is known about the quality of these transcribed directions received by patients. Methods:
      
    

    
      A retrospective observational analysis of 529 990 e-prescription directions processed at a mail-order pharmacy in the USA. We measured pharmacy staff editing of directions using string edit distance and execution time using the Keystroke-Level Model. Using the New Dale-Chall (NDC) readability formula, we calculated NDC cloze scores of the patient directions before and after transcription. We also evaluated the quality of directions (eg, included a dose, dose unit, frequency of administration) before and after transcription with a random sample of 966 patient directions. Results:
      
    

    
      Pharmacy staff edited 83.8% of all e-prescription directions received with a median edit distance of 18 per e-prescription. We estimated a median of 6.64 s of transcribing each e-prescription. The median NDC score increased by 68.6% after transcription (26.12 vs 44.03, p<0.001), which indicated a significant readability improvement. In our sample, 51.4% of patient directions on e-prescriptions contained at least one pre-defined direction quality issue. Pharmacy staff corrected 79.5% of the quality issues. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Pharmacy staff put significant effort into transcribing e-prescription directions. Manual transcription removed the majority of quality issues; however, pharmacy staff still miss or introduce following their manual transcription processes. The development of tools and techniques such as a comprehensive set of structured direction components or machine learning-based natural language processing techniques may help produce clear directions.","['1 Department of Clinical Pharmacy, University of Michigan College of Pharmacy, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', '2 Department of Systems, Populations and Leadership, University of Michigan School of Nursing, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', '3 Department of Learning Health Sciences, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', '4 Department of Clinical Pharmacy, University of Michigan College of Pharmacy, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA lesterca@umich.edu.']","Yifan Zheng, Yun Jiang, Michael P Dorsch, Yuting Ding, V G Vinod Vydiswaran, Corey A Lester, ",BMJ quality & safety,2020,human error; human factors; information technology; medication safety; pharmacists.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32451350
1049,Assessing Patient Experience and Healthcare Quality of Dental Care Using Patient Online Reviews in the United States: Mixed Methods Study,"Background:
      
    

    
      Over the last two decades, patient review websites have emerged as an essential online platform for doctor ratings and reviews. Recent studies suggested the significance of such websites as a data source for patients to choose doctors for healthcare providers to learn and improve from patient feedback and to foster a culture of trust and transparency between patients and healthcare providers. However, as compared to other medical specialties, studies of online patient reviews that focus on dentists in the United States remain absent. Objective:
      
    

    
      This study sought to understand to what extent online patient reviews can provide performance feedbacks that reflect dental care quality and patient experience. Methods:
      
    

    
      Using mixed informatics methods incorporating statistics, natural language processing, and domain expert evaluation, we analyzed the online patient reviews of 204,751 dentists extracted from HealthGrades with two specific aims. First, we examined the associations between patient ratings and a variety of dentist characteristics. Second, we identified topics from patient reviews that can be mapped to the national assessment of dental patient experience measured by the Patient Experience Measures from the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) Dental Plan Survey. Results:
      
    

    
      Higher ratings were associated with female dentists (t71881=2.45, P<.01, g=0.01), dentists at a younger age (F7, 107128=246.97, P<.001, g=0.11), and those whose patients experienced a short wait time (F4, 150055=10417.77, P<0.001, g=0.18). We also identified several topics that corresponded to CAHPS measures, including discomfort (eg, painful/painless root canal or deep cleaning), and ethics (eg, high-pressure sales, and unnecessary dental work). Conclusions:

1050,How Much Knowledge Is Too Little? When a Lack of Knowledge Becomes a Barrier to Comprehension,"Have you ever found it difficult to read something because you lack knowledge on the topic? We investigated this phenomenon with a sample of 3,534 high school students who took a background-knowledge test before working on a reading-comprehension test on the topic of ecology. Broken-line regression revealed a knowledge threshold: Below the threshold, the relationship between comprehension and knowledge was weak (β = 0.18), but above the threshold, a strong and positive relation emerged (β = 0.81). Further analyses indicated that certain topically relevant words (e.g., ecosystem, habitat) were more important to know than others when predicting the threshold, and these keywords could be identified using natural-language-processing techniques. Collectively, these results may help identify who is likely to have a problem comprehending information on a specific topic and, to some extent, what knowledge is likely required to comprehend information on that topic.","['1 Global Assessment, Educational Testing Service, Princeton, New Jersey.', '2 Department of Psychology, The University of Memphis.']","Tenaha O'Reilly, Zuowei Wang, John Sabatini, ",Psychological science,2019 Sep,background knowledge; broken-line regression; content-area reading; knowledge-threshold hypothesis; reading comprehension.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31343951
1051,"Using Text Messaging, Social Media, and Interviews to Understand What Pregnant Youth Think About Weight Gain During Pregnancy","Background:
      
    

    
      The majority of pregnant youth gain more weight than recommended by the National Academy of Medicine guidelines. Excess weight gain during pregnancy increases the risk of dangerous complications during delivery, including operative delivery and stillbirth, and contributes to the risk of long-term obesity in both mother and child. Little is known regarding youth's perceptions of and knowledge about weight gain during pregnancy. Objective:
      
    

    
      The aim of this study was to describe the feasibility and acceptability of 3 novel data collection and analysis strategies for use with youth (social media posts, text message surveys, and semistructured interviews) to explore their experiences during pregnancy. The mixed-methods analysis included natural language processing and thematic analysis. Methods:

We explored a number of state-of-the-art deep learning models and found that the recent Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers can achieve better results than other deep learning models and other state-of-the-art methods. We further utilized an unlabeled clinical corpus to fine-tune the BERT language model before training the text classifier. The method only uses Chinese characters in clinical text as input without preprocessing or feature engineering. We evaluated deep learning models and traditional text classifiers on a benchmark data set. Our method achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy 89.39% ± 0.35%, Macro F1 score 88.64% ± 0.40% and Micro F1 score 89.39% ± 0.35%.

We evaluate performance on a corpus of 374,899 pathology reports obtained from the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. Each pathology report is associated with five clinical classification tasks - site, laterality, behavior, histology, and grade. We compare the performance of the HiSAN against other machine learning and deep learning approaches commonly used on medical text data - Naive Bayes, logistic regression, convolutional neural networks, and hierarchical attention networks (the previous state-of-the-art). We show that HiSANs are superior to other machine learning and deep learning text classifiers in both accuracy and macro F-score across all five classification tasks. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art, hierarchical attention networks, HiSANs not only are an order of magnitude faster to train, but also achieve about 1% better relative accuracy and 5% better relative macro F-score.","['1 Computational Sciences and Engineering Division, Health Data Sciences Institute, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN, USA.

1054,Utility of a Computerized ICD-10 Algorithm to Identify Idiosyncratic Drug-Induced Liver Injury Cases in the Electronic Medical Record,"Introduction:
      
    

    
      Idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is an important cause of liver injury that is difficult to diagnose and identify in the electronic medical record (EMR). Objective:
      
    

    
      Our objective was to develop a computerized algorithm that can reliably identify DILI cases from the EMR. Methods:
      
    

    
      The EMR was searched for all encounters with an International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) T code for drug toxicity and a K-71 code for toxic liver injury between 1 October 2015 and 30 September 2018. Clinically significant liver injury was defined using predetermined laboratory values. An expert opinion causality score (1-3 = probable DILI, 4/5 = non-DILI), Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM) score, and severity score was assigned to each case. Results:
      
    

    
      Among the 1,211,787 encounters searched, 517 had both an ICD-10 T code and a K-71 code, with 257 patients meeting the laboratory criteria. After excluding 75 cases of acetaminophen hepatotoxicity, the final study sample included 182 cases of potential DILI, with antineoplastics and antibiotics being the most frequently implicated agents. Causality assessment identified probable DILI in 121 patients (66.5%), whereas 61 (33.5%) had an alternative cause of liver injury. Although age, sex, race, and suspect drugs were similar, the probable DILI cases were more likely to present with a hepatocellular injury profile and have more severe liver injury than the non-DILI cases (p < 0.05). Conclusion:
      
    

    
      A computerized algorithm based on a combination of ICD-10 codes identified 182 potential DILI cases with 121 true positives, 61 false positives, and a positive predictive value of 66.5%. Future studies incorporating natural language processing may further improve the utility of this algorithm in identifying high-causality idiosyncratic DILI cases.","['1 Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA.', '2 Digestive Diseases, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, 45267, USA.', '3 Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA. rfontana@med.umich.edu.']","Amoah Yeboah-Korang, Jeremy Louissaint, Irene Tsung, Sharmila Prabhu, Robert J Fontana, ",Drug safety,2020 Apr,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31916081

      Variations in treatment choice, or late stage at first diagnosis, mean that, despite guideline recommendations, not all patients with hormone receptor (hr)-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (la/mbca) will have received endocrine therapy before disease progression. In the present study, we aimed to estimate the proportion of women with postmenopausal hr-positive la/mbca in the United States who are endocrine therapy-naïve. Methods:
      
    

    
      Women in the Optum Electronic Health Record (ehr) database with a breast cancer (bca) diagnosis (January 2008-March 2015) were included. Patient and malignancy characteristics were identified using structured data fields and natural-language processing of free-text clinical notes. The proportion of women with postmenopausal hr-positive, human epidermal growth factor 2 (her2)-negative (or unknown) la/mbca who had not received prior endocrine therapy was determined. Results were extrapolated to the entire U.S. population using the U.S. National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Results are presented descriptively. Results:
      
    

    
      In the ehr database, 11,831 women with bca had discernible information on postmenopausal status, hr status, and disease stage. Of those women, 1923 (16.3%) had postmenopausal hr-positive, her2-negative (or unknown) la/mbca, and 70.7% of those 1923 patients (n = 1360) had not received prior endocrine therapy, accounting for 11.5% of the overall population. Extrapolating those estimates nationally suggests an annual incidence of 14,784 cases, and a 5-year limited duration prevalence of 50,638 cases. Conclusions:

1056,Multivariate fMRI pattern analysis of fear perception across modalities,"The emotional expression of fear can be processed through a number of modalities, and of varying forms, however, much of the functional imaging literature has centered on investigating fear as expressed through faces. Findings point to an active involvement of the amygdala, and remain fairly consistent in other studies of unimodal fear perception; however, few studies have looked at within-subject cross-modal responses to fear. Thus, we approached this inquiry by testing 30 healthy young adults with fast, high-resolution fMRI, recording the neural responses of fear perception, as expressed through faces, bodies, prosody, and vocalizations. The study was analyzed using a multivariate approach (multi-voxel pattern analysis) and yielded a significant distinction in the responses associated with the perception of fearful vs. neutral emotions. Calculated weights highlighted areas in the amygdala and surrounding subcortical structures as contributing the greatest to the discrimination; however, a whole-brain analysis was necessary to obtain above-chance classification accuracy, suggesting that processing fear across modalities likely involves a broad, distributed network. Thus, our findings support a multivariate approach to studying a highly complex construct such as emotion, as it accounts for multiple voxels simultaneously and can accommodate the high subject-level variability that oftentimes comes with studying emotion perception.","['1 Douglas Mental Health University Institute, Verdun, Quebec, Canada.', '2 BRAMS Laboratory, Centre for Research on Brain, Language and Music, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', '3 Integrated Program in Neuroscience, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', '4 Department of Psychiatry, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']","Jocelyne C Whitehead, Jorge L Armony, ",The European journal of neuroscience,2019 Jun,cross-modality; emotion perception; functional magnetic resonance imaging; multi-voxel pattern analysis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30589141

Elevated Lp(a) affects approximately one in five individuals and meaningfully contributes to the residual cardiovascular risk in individuals with otherwise well-controlled risk factors. With targeted therapies in the therapeutic pipeline, there is a need to further characterize the clinical phenotypes and outcomes of individuals with elevated levels of this unique biomarker. The Mass General Brigham Lp(a) Registry will be built from the longitudinal electronic health record of two large academic medical centers in Boston, Massachusetts, to develop a detailed cohort of patients who have had their Lp(a) measured. In combination with structured data sources, clinical documentation will be analyzed using natural language processing techniques to accurately characterize baseline characteristics. Important outcome measures including all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and cardiovascular events will be available for analysis. Approximately 30 000 patients who have had their Lp(a) tested within the Mass General Brigham system from January 2000 to July 2019 will be included in the registry. This large Lp(a) cohort will provide meaningful observational data regarding the differential risk associated with Lp(a) values and cardiovascular disease.

1059,Temporal information extraction from mental health records to identify duration of untreated psychosis,"Background:
      
    

    
      Duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) is an important clinical construct in the field of mental health, as longer DUP can be associated with worse intervention outcomes. DUP estimation requires knowledge about when psychosis symptoms first started (symptom onset), and when psychosis treatment was initiated. Electronic health records (EHRs) represent a useful resource for retrospective clinical studies on DUP, but the core information underlying this construct is most likely to lie in free text, meaning it is not readily available for clinical research. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a means to addressing this problem by automatically extracting relevant information in a structured form. As a first step, it is important to identify appropriate documents, i.e., those that are likely to include the information of interest. Next, temporal information extraction methods are needed to identify time references for early psychosis symptoms. This NLP challenge requires solving three different tasks: time expression extraction, symptom extraction, and temporal ""linking"". In this study, we focus on the first step, using two relevant EHR datasets. Results:
      
    

    
      We applied a rule-based NLP system for time expression extraction that we had previously adapted to a corpus of mental health EHRs from patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia (first referrals). We extended this work by applying this NLP system to a larger set of documents and patients, to identify additional texts that would be relevant for our long-term goal, and developed a new corpus from a subset of these new texts (early intervention services). Furthermore, we added normalized value annotations (""2011-05"") to the annotated time expressions (""May 2011"") in both corpora. The finalized corpora were used for further NLP development and evaluation, with promising results (normalization accuracy 71-86%). To highlight the specificities of our annotation task, we also applied the final adapted NLP system to a different temporally annotated clinical corpus. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Developing domain-specific methods is crucial to address complex NLP tasks such as symptom onset extraction and retrospective calculation of duration of a preclinical syndrome. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first clinical text resource annotated for temporal entities in the mental health domain.","[""1 Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, De Crespigny Park, London, SE5 8AF, UK. natalia.viani@kcl.ac.uk."", ""2 Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, De Crespigny Park, London, SE5 8AF, UK."", '3 South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.']","Natalia Viani, Joyce Kam, Lucia Yin, André Bittar, Rina Dutta, Rashmi Patel, Robert Stewart, Sumithra Velupillai, ",Journal of biomedical semantics,2020,Electronic health records; Mental health; Natural language processing; Schizophrenia; Temporal information extraction.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32156302
1060,From POS tagging to dependency parsing for biomedical event extraction,"Background:
      
    

    
      Given the importance of relation or event extraction from biomedical research publications to support knowledge capture and synthesis, and the strong dependency of approaches to this information extraction task on syntactic information, it is valuable to understand which approaches to syntactic processing of biomedical text have the highest performance. Results:
      
    

    
      We perform an empirical study comparing state-of-the-art traditional feature-based and neural network-based models for two core natural language processing tasks of part-of-speech (POS) tagging and dependency parsing on two benchmark biomedical corpora, GENIA and CRAFT. To the best of our knowledge, there is no recent work making such comparisons in the biomedical context; specifically no detailed analysis of neural models on this data is available. Experimental results show that in general, the neural models outperform the feature-based models on two benchmark biomedical corpora GENIA and CRAFT. We also perform a task-oriented evaluation to investigate the influences of these models in a downstream application on biomedical event extraction, and show that better intrinsic parsing performance does not always imply better extrinsic event extraction performance. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      We have presented a detailed empirical study comparing traditional feature-based and neural network-based models for POS tagging and dependency parsing in the biomedical context, and also investigated the influence of parser selection for a biomedical event extraction downstream task.

1061,A Novel Deep-Learning-Based Bug Severity Classification Technique Using Convolutional Neural Networks and Random Forest with Boosting,"The accurate severity classification of a bug report is an important aspect of bug fixing. The bug reports are submitted into the bug tracking system with high speed, and owing to this, bug repository size has been increasing at an enormous rate. This increased bug repository size introduces biases in the bug triage process. Therefore, it is necessary to classify the severity of a bug report to balance the bug triaging process. Previously, many machine learning models were proposed for automation of bug severity classification. The accuracy of these models is not up to the mark because they do not extract the important feature patterns for learning the classifier. This paper proposes a novel deep learning model for multiclass severity classification called Bug Severity classification to address these challenges by using a Convolutional Neural Network and Random forest with Boosting (BCR). This model directly learns the latent and highly representative features. Initially, the natural language techniques preprocess the bug report text, and then n-gram is used to extract the features. Further, the Convolutional Neural Network extracts the important feature patterns of respective severity classes. Lastly, the random forest with boosting classifies the multiple bug severity classes. The average accuracy of the proposed model is 96.34% on multiclass severity of five open source projects. The average F-measures of the proposed BCR and the existing approach were 96.43% and 84.24%, respectively, on binary class severity classification. The results prove that the proposed BCR approach enhances the performance of bug severity classification over the state-of-the-art techniques.","['1 Department of Computer Science Jaypee University of Information Technology, Waknaghat 173 234, India.', '2 Graduate School, Duy Tan University, Da Nang 550000, Viet Nam.', '3 Department of ICT Convergence Rehabilitation Engineering, Soonchunhyang University, Asan 31538, Korea.', '4 Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Soonchunhyang University, Asan 31538, Korea. bgkang@sch.ac.kr.', '5 Department of Computer Science and IT, La Trobe University, Melbourne 3086, Australia.']","Ashima Kukkar, Rajni Mohana, Anand Nayyar, Jeamin Kim, Byeong-Gwon Kang, Naveen Chilamkurti, ","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019,convolutional neural network; deep learning; n-gram; natural language processing; random forest; severity classification; software reliability.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31284398
1062,Describing the antimicrobial usage patterns of companion animal veterinary practices; free text analysis of more than 4.4 million consultation records,"Antimicrobial Resistance is a global crisis that veterinarians contribute to through their use of antimicrobials in animals. Antimicrobial stewardship has been shown to be an effective means to reduce antimicrobial resistance in hospital environments. Effective monitoring of antimicrobial usage patterns is an essential part of antimicrobial stewardship and is critical in reducing the development of antimicrobial resistance. The aim of this study is to describe how frequently antimicrobials were used in veterinary consultations and identify the most frequently used antimicrobials. Using VetCompass Australia, Natural Language Processing techniques, and the Australian Strategic Technical Advisory Group's (ASTAG) Rating system to classify the importance of antimicrobials, descriptive analysis was performed on the antimicrobials prescribed in consultations from 137 companion animal veterinary clinics in Australia between 2013 and 2017 (inclusive). Of the 4,400,519 consultations downloaded there were 595,089 consultations where antimicrobials were prescribed to dogs or cats. Antimicrobials were dispensed in 145 of every 1000 canine consultations; and 38 per 1000 consultations involved high importance rated antimicrobials. Similarly with cats, 108 per 1000 consultations had antimicrobials dispensed, and in 47 per 1000 consultations an antimicrobial of high importance rating was administered. The most common antimicrobials given to cats and dogs were cefovecin and amoxycillin clavulanate, respectively. The most common topical antimicrobial and high-rated topical antimicrobial given to dogs and cats was polymyxin B. This study provides a descriptive analysis of the antimicrobial usage patterns in Australia using methods that can be automated to inform antimicrobial use surveillance programs and promote antimicrobial stewardship.","['1 Asia-Pacific Centre for Animal Health, Melbourne Veterinary School, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', '2 School of Computing and Information Systems, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', '3 Centre for the Digital Transformation of Health, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.']","Brian A Hur, Laura Y Hardefeldt, Karin M Verspoor, Timothy Baldwin, James R Gilkerson, ",PloS one,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32168354
1063,Differences in Biologic Utilization and Surgery Rates in Pediatric and Adult Crohn's Disease: Results From a Large Electronic Medical Record-derived Cohort,"Background and aims:
      
    

    
      Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic illness that affects both the pediatric and adult populations with an increasing worldwide prevalence. We aim to identify a large, single-center cohort of patients with CD using natural language processing (NLP) in combination with codified data and extract surgical rates and medication usage from the electronic medical record (EMR). Methods:
      
    

    
      Patients with CD were identified from the entire Cleveland Clinic EMR using ICD codes and CD-specific terms identified by NLP to fit a logistic regression model. Cohorts were developed for pediatric-onset (younger than 18 years) and adult-onset (18 years and older) CD. Surgeries were identified using current procedural terminology (CPT) codes and NLP. Crohn's disease-related medications were extracted using physician orders in the EMR. Results:
      
    

    
      Patients with pediatric-onset (n = 2060) and adult-onset (n = 4973) CD were identified from 2000 to 2017 with a positive predictive value of 98.5%. Rate of CD-related abdominal surgery over time was significantly higher in adult-onset compared with pediatric-onset CD (10-year surgery rate 49.9% vs 37.7%, respectively; P < 0.001). Treatment with biologics was significantly higher in pediatric vs adult-onset CD cohorts (63.6% vs 49.2%; P < 0.001). The overall rate of CD-related abdominal surgery was significantly higher in those who received <6 months of a biologic compared with ≥6 months of a biologic for both cohorts (pediatric 64.1% vs 39.1%, P ≤ 0.001; adult 69.3% vs 56.5%, P ≤ 0.001). Additionally, 60.9% in pediatric-onset CD and 43.5% in adult-onset CD treated with ≥6 months of biologic therapy have not required abdominal surgery. On multivariable analysis, perianal surgery was a significant risk factor for abdominal surgery in both cohorts. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      We used a combination of codified and NLP data to establish the largest, North American, single-center EMR cohort of pediatric- and adult-onset CD patients and determined that biologics are associated with lower rates of surgery over time, potentially altering the natural history of the disease.","[""1 Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology & Nutrition; Cleveland Clinic Children's, Cleveland, Ohio, USA."", '2 Quantitative Health Sciences, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.', '3 Gastroenterology, Hepatology & Nutrition, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.']","Jacob A Kurowski, Alex Milinovich, Xinge Ji, Janine Bauman, David Sugano, Michael W Kattan, Jean-Paul Achkar, ",Inflammatory bowel diseases,2020,Crohn’s disease; biologics; natural language processing; pediatrics; surgery.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32914165
1064,Differences in Narrative Language in Evaluations of Medical Students by Gender and Under-represented Minority Status,"Background:
      
    

    
      In varied educational settings, narrative evaluations have revealed systematic and deleterious differences in language describing women and those underrepresented in their fields. In medicine, limited qualitative studies show differences in narrative language by gender and under-represented minority (URM) status. Objective:
      
    

    
      To identify and enumerate text descriptors in a database of medical student evaluations using natural language processing, and identify differences by gender and URM status in descriptions. Design:
      
    

    
      An observational study of core clerkship evaluations of third-year medical students, including data on student gender, URM status, clerkship grade, and specialty. Participants:
      
    

    
      A total of 87,922 clerkship evaluations from core clinical rotations at two medical schools in different geographic areas. Main measures:
      
    

    
      We employed natural language processing to identify differences in the text of evaluations for women compared to men and for URM compared to non-URM students. Key results:
      
    

    
      We found that of the ten most common words, such as ""energetic"" and ""dependable,"" none differed by gender or URM status. Of the 37 words that differed by gender, 62% represented personal attributes, such as ""lovely"" appearing more frequently in evaluations of women (p < 0.001), while 19% represented competency-related behaviors, such as ""scientific"" appearing more frequently in evaluations of men (p < 0.001). Of the 53 words that differed by URM status, 30% represented personal attributes, such as ""pleasant"" appearing more frequently in evaluations of URM students (p < 0.001), and 28% represented competency-related behaviors, such as ""knowledgeable"" appearing more frequently in evaluations of non-URM students (p < 0.001). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Many words and phrases reflected students' personal attributes rather than competency-related behaviors, suggesting a gap in implementing competency-based evaluation of students. We observed a significant difference in narrative evaluations associated with gender and URM status, even among students receiving the same grade. This finding raises concern for implicit bias in narrative evaluation, consistent with prior studies, and suggests opportunities for improvement.","['1 University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine, San Francisco, CA, USA.', '2 Division of Hospital Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine, San Francisco, CA, USA.', '3 Health Informatics, UCSF Health, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', '4 Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI, USA.', '5 UCSF Center for Vulnerable Populations, San Francisco, CA, USA.', '6 University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine, San Francisco, CA, USA. urmimala.sarkar@ucsf.edu.', '7 UCSF Center for Vulnerable Populations, San Francisco, CA, USA. urmimala.sarkar@ucsf.edu.']","Alexandra E Rojek, Raman Khanna, Joanne W L Yim, Rebekah Gardner, Sarah Lisker, Karen E Hauer, Catherine Lucey, Urmimala Sarkar, ",Journal of general internal medicine,2019 May,medical education; medical education—assessment/evaluation; medical student and residency education.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30993609
1065,Linguistic generalization and compositionality in modern artificial neural networks,"In the last decade, deep artificial neural networks have achieved astounding performance in many natural language-processing tasks. Given the high productivity of language, these models must possess effective generalization abilities. It is widely assumed that humans handle linguistic productivity by means of algebraic compositional rules: are deep networks similarly compositional? After reviewing the main innovations characterizing current deep language-processing networks, I discuss a set of studies suggesting that deep networks are capable of subtle grammar-dependent generalizations, but also that they do not rely on systematic compositional rules. I argue that the intriguing behaviour of these devices (still awaiting a full understanding) should be of interest to linguists and cognitive scientists, as it offers a new perspective on possible computational strategies to deal with linguistic productivity beyond rule-based compositionality, and it might lead to new insights into the less systematic generalization patterns that also appear in natural language.

Although most language-related theories acknowledge a large role for experience in language processing, variability reflecting that knowledge is usually ignored when evaluating a model's fit to representative data. We fit language-based behavioral data using experiential optimization, a method that optimizes the materials that a model is given while retaining the learning and processing mechanisms of standard practice. Rather than using default materials, experiential optimization selects the optimal linguistic sources to create a memory representation that maximizes task performance. We demonstrate performance on multiple benchmark tasks by optimizing the experience on which a model's representation is based.","['1 Department of Communicative Disorders and Sciences, University at Buffalo, 122 Cary Hall, Buffalo, NY, 14214, USA. btjohns@buffalo.edu.', '2 Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA.', ""3 Queen's University, Kingston, Canada.""]","Brendan T Johns, Michael N Jones, D J K Mewhort, ",Psychonomic bulletin & review,2019 Feb,Cognitive modeling; Corpus-based modeling; Distributional semantics; Language processing; Model optimization.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29968206

The artificial neural network was introduced in the 1950s. However, because of the low computing power and insufficient datasets available at that time, artificial neural networks suffered from overfitting and vanishing gradient problems for training deep networks. This concept has become more promising owing to the enhanced big data processing capability, improvement in computing power with parallel processing units, and new algorithms for deep neural networks, which are becoming increasingly successful and attracting interest in many domains, including computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing.

1068,Measuring the impact of screening automation on meta-analyses of diagnostic test accuracy,"Background:
      
    

    
      The large and increasing number of new studies published each year is making literature identification in systematic reviews ever more time-consuming and costly. Technological assistance has been suggested as an alternative to the conventional, manual study identification to mitigate the cost, but previous literature has mainly evaluated methods in terms of recall (search sensitivity) and workload reduction. There is a need to also evaluate whether screening prioritization methods leads to the same results and conclusions as exhaustive manual screening. In this study, we examined the impact of one screening prioritization method based on active learning on sensitivity and specificity estimates in systematic reviews of diagnostic test accuracy. Methods:
      
    

    
      We simulated the screening process in 48 Cochrane reviews of diagnostic test accuracy and re-run 400 meta-analyses based on a least 3 studies. We compared screening prioritization (with technological assistance) and screening in randomized order (standard practice without technology assistance). We examined if the screening could have been stopped before identifying all relevant studies while still producing reliable summary estimates. For all meta-analyses, we also examined the relationship between the number of relevant studies and the reliability of the final estimates. Results:
      
    

    
      The main meta-analysis in each systematic review could have been performed after screening an average of 30% of the candidate articles (range 0.07 to 100%). No systematic review would have required screening more than 2308 studies, whereas manual screening would have required screening up to 43,363 studies. Despite an average 70% recall, the estimation error would have been 1.3% on average, compared to an average 2% estimation error expected when replicating summary estimate calculations. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Screening prioritization coupled with stopping criteria in diagnostic test accuracy reviews can reliably detect when the screening process has identified a sufficient number of studies to perform the main meta-analysis with an accuracy within pre-specified tolerance limits. However, many of the systematic reviews did not identify a sufficient number of studies that the meta-analyses were accurate within a 2% limit even with exhaustive manual screening, i.e., using current practice.","['1 LIMSI, CNRS, Université Paris Saclay, Rue du Belvedère, Orsay, 91405, France. christopher.norman@limsi.fr.', '2 Amsterdam Public Health, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 9, Amsterdam, 1105 AZ, the Netherlands. christopher.norman@limsi.fr.', '3 Amsterdam Public Health, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 9, Amsterdam, 1105 AZ, the Netherlands.', '4 Center for Clinical Epidemiology, Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris, Hôtel Dieu Hospital; Team METHODS, CRESS, INSERM U1153; University Paris Descartes, 1 place du Parvis Notre-Dame, Paris, 75004, France.', '5 LIMSI, CNRS, Université Paris Saclay, Rue du Belvedère, Orsay, 91405, France.']","Christopher R Norman, Mariska M G Leeflang, Raphaël Porcher, Aurélie Névéol, ",Systematic reviews,2019,*Machine learning; *Systematic review as topic; Evidence based medicine; Natural language processing/*methods.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31661028

The lack of systematic coding is a major barrier to the growing interest in leveraging veterinary records for public health and translational research. Recent machine learning effort is limited to predicting 42 top-level diagnosis categories from veterinary notes. Here we develop a large-scale algorithm to automatically predict all 4577 standard veterinary diagnosis codes from free text. We train our algorithm on a curated dataset of over 100 K expert labeled veterinary notes and over one million unlabeled notes. Our algorithm is based on the adapted Transformer architecture and we demonstrate that large-scale language modeling on the unlabeled notes via pretraining and as an auxiliary objective during supervised learning greatly improves performance. We systematically evaluate the performance of the model and several baselines in challenging settings where algorithms trained on one hospital are evaluated in a different hospital with substantial domain shift. In addition, we show that hierarchical training can address severe data imbalances for fine-grained diagnosis with a few training cases, and we provide interpretation for what is learned by the deep network.

While previous studies have shown that excessive alcohol use can be detected from general patterns of social media engagement, we characterized how drinking-specific language varies across regions and cultures in the US. From a database of 38 billion public tweets, we selected those mentioning ""drunk"", found the words and phrases distinctive of drinking posts, and then clustered these into topics and sets of semantically related words. We identified geolocated ""drunk"" tweets and correlated their language with the prevalence of self-reported excessive alcohol consumption (Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System; BRFSS). We then identified linguistic markers associated with excessive drinking in different regions and cultural communities as identified by the American Community Project. ""Drunk"" tweet frequency (of the 3.3 million geolocated ""drunk"" tweets) correlated with excessive alcohol consumption at both the county and state levels (r = 0.26 and 0.45, respectively, p < 0.01). Topic analyses revealed that excessive alcohol consumption was most correlated with references to drinking with friends (r = 0.20), family (r = 0.15), and driving under the influence (r = 0.14). Using the American Community Project classification, we found a number of cultural markers of drinking: religious communities had a high frequency of anti-drunk driving tweets, Hispanic centers discussed family members drinking, and college towns discussed sexual behavior. This study shows that Twitter can be used to explore the specific sociocultural contexts in which excessive alcohol use occurs within particular regions and communities. These findings can inform more targeted public health messaging and help to better understand cultural determinants of substance abuse.","['1 Computer and Information Science Department, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.', '2 National Institutes of Health, National Institute on Drug Abuse, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', '3 Department of Psychology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.', '4 Department of Psychology & Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', '5 Substance Use Disorders Institute, University of the Sciences, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.', '6 Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY 11794, USA.']","Salvatore Giorgi, David B Yaden, Johannes C Eichstaedt, Robert D Ashford, Anneke E K Buffone, H Andrew Schwartz, Lyle H Ungar, Brenda Curtis, ",International journal of environmental research and public health,2020,American Communities Project; Twitter; excessive drinking; natural language processing; social media.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32053866

      Electronic health records linked with biorepositories are a powerful platform for translational studies. A major bottleneck exists in the ability to phenotype patients accurately and efficiently. The objective of this study was to develop an automated high-throughput phenotyping method integrating International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes and narrative data extracted using natural language processing (NLP). Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      We developed a mapping method for automatically identifying relevant ICD and NLP concepts for a specific phenotype leveraging the Unified Medical Language System. Along with health care utilization, aggregated ICD and NLP counts were jointly analyzed by fitting an ensemble of latent mixture models. The multimodal automated phenotyping (MAP) algorithm yields a predicted probability of phenotype for each patient and a threshold for classifying participants with phenotype yes/no. The algorithm was validated using labeled data for 16 phenotypes from a biorepository and further tested in an independent cohort phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) for 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms with known associations. Results:
      
    

    
      The MAP algorithm achieved higher or similar AUC and F-scores compared to the ICD code across all 16 phenotypes. The features assembled via the automated approach had comparable accuracy to those assembled via manual curation (AUCMAP 0.943, AUCmanual 0.941). The PheWAS results suggest that the MAP approach detected previously validated associations with higher power when compared to the standard PheWAS method based on ICD codes.

1074,Errors in search strategies used in systematic reviews and their effects on information retrieval,"Objectives:
      
    

    
      Errors in search strategies negatively affect the quality and validity of systematic reviews. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate searches performed in MEDLINE/PubMed to identify errors and determine their effects on information retrieval. Methods:
      
    

    
      A PubMed search was conducted using the systematic review filter to identify articles that were published in January of 2018. Systematic reviews or meta-analyses were selected from a systematic search for literature containing reproducible and explicit search strategies in MEDLINE/PubMed. Data were extracted from these studies related to ten types of errors and to the terms and phrases search modes. Results:
      
    

    
      The study included 137 systematic reviews in which the number of search strategies containing some type of error was very high (92.7%). Errors that affected recall were the most frequent (78.1%), and the most common search errors involved missing terms in both natural language and controlled language and those related to Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) search terms and the non-retrieval of their more specific terms. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      To improve the quality of searches and avoid errors, it is essential to plan the search strategy carefully, which includes consulting the MeSH database to identify the concepts and choose all appropriate terms, both descriptors and synonyms, and combining search techniques in the free-text and controlled-language fields, truncating the terms appropriately to retrieve all their variants.","['1 Professor, Department of Library and Information Science and Faculty of Medicine, University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain, jaso@unizar.es.', '2 Professor, Department of Library and Information Science and Faculty of Medicine, University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain, gmarco@unizar.es.', '3 Professor, Department of Library and Information Science, Complutense University of Madrid, Madrid, Spain, carquero@ucm.es.']","José Antonio Salvador-Oliván, Gonzalo Marco-Cuenca, Rosario Arquero-Avilés, ",Journal of the Medical Library Association : JMLA,2019 Apr,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31019390
1075,Classifying Pseudogout using Machine Learning Approaches with Electronic Health Record Data,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Identifying pseudogout in large datasets is difficult due to its episodic nature and lack of billing codes specific to this acute subtype of calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) deposition disease. We evaluated a novel machine learning approach for classifying pseudogout using electronic health record (EHR) data. Methods:
      
    

    
      We created an EHR data mart of patients with ≥1 relevant billing code or ≥2 natural language processing (NLP) mentions of pseudogout or chondrocalcinosis, 1991-2017. We selected 900 for gold standard chart review for: (1) definite pseudogout, synovitis+synovial fluid CPP crystals; (2) probable pseudogout, synovitis+chondrocalcinosis; (3) not pseudogout. We applied a topic modeling approach to identify definite/probable pseudogout. A combined algorithm included topic modeling plus manually-reviewed CPP crystal results. We compared algorithm performance and cohorts identified by: (1) billing codes, (2) presence of CPP crystals, (3) topic modeling, (4) combined algorithm. Results:
      
    

    
      Among 900 subjects, 123 (13.7%) had pseudogout by chart review (68 definite, 55 probable). Billing codes had sensitivity 65% and PPV 22% for pseudogout. Presence of CPP crystals had sensitivity 29% and PPV 92%. Without using CPP crystal results, topic modeling had sensitivity 29% and PPV 79%. The combined algorithm yielded sensitivity 42% and PPV 81%. The combined algorithm identified 50% more patients than presence of CPP crystals; the latter captured a portion of definite pseudogout and missed probable pseudogout. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      For pseudogout, an episodic disease with no specific billing code, combining NLP, machine learning methods, and synovial fluid lab results yielded an algorithm that significantly boosted PPV compared to billing codes.","[""1 Division of Rheumatology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, USA."", '2 Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA.', '3 Harvard T.H.

1076,Natural Language Processing for the Identification of Silent Brain Infarcts From Neuroimaging Reports,"Background:
      
    

    
      Silent brain infarction (SBI) is defined as the presence of 1 or more brain lesions, presumed to be because of vascular occlusion, found by neuroimaging (magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography) in patients without clinical manifestations of stroke. It is more common than stroke and can be detected in 20% of healthy elderly people. Early detection of SBI may mitigate the risk of stroke by offering preventative treatment plans. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques offer an opportunity to systematically identify SBI cases from electronic health records (EHRs) by extracting, normalizing, and classifying SBI-related incidental findings interpreted by radiologists from neuroimaging reports. Objective:
      
    

    
      This study aimed to develop NLP systems to determine individuals with incidentally discovered SBIs from neuroimaging reports at 2 sites: Mayo Clinic and Tufts Medical Center. Methods:
      
    

    
      Both rule-based and machine learning approaches were adopted in developing the NLP system. The rule-based system was implemented using the open source NLP pipeline MedTagger, developed by Mayo Clinic. Features for rule-based systems, including significant words and patterns related to SBI, were generated using pointwise mutual information. The machine learning models adopted convolutional neural network (CNN), random forest, support vector machine, and logistic regression. The performance of the NLP algorithm was compared with a manually created gold standard. The gold standard dataset includes 1000 radiology reports randomly retrieved from the 2 study sites (Mayo and Tufts) corresponding to patients with no prior or current diagnosis of stroke or dementia. 400 out of the 1000 reports were randomly sampled and double read to determine interannotator agreements. The gold standard dataset was equally split to 3 subsets for training, developing, and testing. Results:
      
    

    
      Among the 400 reports selected to determine interannotator agreement, 5 reports were removed due to invalid scan types. The interannotator agreements across Mayo and Tufts neuroimaging reports were 0.87 and 0.91, respectively. The rule-based system yielded the best performance of predicting SBI with an accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.991, 0.925, 1.000, 1.000, and 0.990, respectively. The CNN achieved the best score on predicting white matter disease (WMD) with an accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 0.994, 0.994, 0.994, 0.994, and 0.994, respectively. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We adopted a standardized data abstraction and modeling process to developed NLP techniques (rule-based and machine learning) to detect incidental SBIs and WMDs from annotated neuroimaging reports. Validation statistics suggested a high feasibility of detecting SBIs and WMDs from EHRs using NLP.","['1 Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States.', '2 Department of Neurology, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA, United States.', '3 Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States.', '4 Institute for Clinical Research and Health Policy Studies, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA, United States.']","Sunyang Fu, Lester Y Leung, Yanshan Wang, Anne-Olivia Raulli, David F Kallmes, Kristin A Kinsman, Kristoff B Nelson, Michael S Clark, Patrick H Luetmer, Paul R Kingsbury, David M Kent, Hongfang Liu, ",JMIR medical informatics,2019,electronic health records; natural language processing; neuroimaging.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31066686
1077,Patient treatment and outcome after breast cancer orbital and periorbital metastases: a comprehensive case series including analysis of lobular versus ductal tumor histology,"Background:
      
    

    
      Breast cancer is the most common malignancy to spread to the orbit and periorbit, and the invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) histologic subtype of breast cancer has been reported to form these ophthalmic metastases (OM) more frequently than invasive ductal carcinomas (IDC). We herein report our single academic institution experience with breast cancer OM with respect to anatomical presentation, histology (lobular vs. ductal), treatment, and survival. Methods:
      
    

    
      We employed the natural language processing platform, TIES (Text Information Extraction System), to search 2.3 million de-identified patient pathology and radiology records at our institution in order to identify patients with OM secondary to breast cancer. We then compared the resultant cohort, the ""OM cohort,"" to two other representative metastatic breast cancer patient (MBC) databases from our institution. Histological analysis of selected patients was performed. Results:
      
    

    
      Our TIES search and manual refinement ultimately identified 28 patients who were diagnosed with breast cancer between 1995 and 2016 that subsequently developed OM. Median age at diagnosis was 54 (range 28-77) years of age. ER, PR, and HER2 status from the 28 patients with OM did not differ from other patients with MBC from our institution. The relative proportion of patients with ILC was significantly higher in the OM cohort (32.1%) than in other MBC patients in our institution (11.3%, p = 0.007). Median time to first OM in the OM cohort was 46.7 months, and OM were the second most frequent first metastases after bony metastases. After diagnosis of the first distant metastasis of any kind, median survival of patients with ILC (21.4 months) was significantly shorter than that of patients with IDC (55.3 months, p = 0.03). Nine patients developed bilateral OM. We observed a significant co-occurrence of OM and central nervous system metastases (p = 0.0053). The histological analysis revealed an interesting case in which the primary tumor was of a mixed ILC/IDC subtype, while only ILC was present in the OM. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      OM from breast cancer are illustrative of the difference in metastatic behavior of ILC versus IDC and should be considered when treating patients with ILC, especially in those with complaints of visual acuity changes.","['1 Department of Pharmacology & Chemical Biology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', '2 Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', ""3 Women's Cancer Research Center, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, Magee Women's Research Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."", '4 Department of Biostatistics, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', '5 University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Department of Radiation Oncology, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', '6 School of Nursing, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', '7 University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', '8 Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', '9 University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.

1078,"The Effects of Dementia Care Co-Management on Acute Care, Hospice, and Long-Term Care Utilization","Background/objectives:
      
    

    
      Although nurse practitioner dementia care co-management has been shown to reduce total cost of care for fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare beneficiaries, the reasons for cost savings are unknown. To further understand the impact of dementia co-management on costs, we examined acute care utilization, long-term care admissions, and hospice use of program enrollees as compared with persons with dementia not in the program using FFS and managed Medicare claims data. Design:
      
    

    
      Quasi-experimental controlled before-and-after comparison. Setting:
      
    

    
      Urban academic medical center. Participants:
      
    

    
      A total of 856 University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Alzheimer's and Dementia Care program patients were enrolled between July 1, 2012, and December 31, 2015, and 3,139 similar UCLA patients with dementia not in the program. Comparison patients were identified as having dementia using International Classification of Diseases-9 codes and natural language processing of clinical notes. Coarsened exact matching was used to reduce covariate imbalance between intervention and comparison patients. Intervention:
      
    

    
      Dementia co-management model using nurse practitioners partnered with primary care providers and community organizations. Measurements:
      
    

    
      Average difference-in-differences per quarter over the 2.5-year intervention period for all-cause hospitalization, emergency department (ED) visits, intensive care unit (ICU) stays, and number of inpatient hospitalization days; admissions to long-term care facilities; and hospice use in the last 6 months of life. Results:
      
    

    
      Intervention patients had fewer ED visits (odds ratio [OR] = .80; 95% confidence interval [CI] = .66-.97) and shorter hospital length of stay (incident rate ratio = .74; 95% CI = .55-.99). There were no significant differences between groups for hospitalizations or ICU stays. Program participants were less likely to be admitted to a long-term care facility (hazard ratio = .65; 95% CI = .47-.89) and more likely to receive hospice services in the last 6 months of life (adjusted OR = 1.64; 95% CI = 1.13-2.37). Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Comprehensive nurse practitioner dementia care co-management reduced ED visits, shortened hospital length of stay, increased hospice use, and delayed admission to long-term care.","['1 Reynolds Section of Geriatrics, Department of Medicine, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, USA.', '2 RAND Health, Santa Monica, California, USA.', '3 Division of General Internal Medicine and Health Services Research, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, California, USA.', '4 Multicampus Program in Geriatric Medicine and Gerontology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, California, USA.']","Lee A Jennings, Simon Hollands, Emmett Keeler, Neil S Wenger, David B Reuben, ",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,2020,care management; dementia; healthcare utilization.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32573765
1079,Survey of Deep-Learning Approaches for Remote Sensing Observation Enhancement,"Deep Learning, and Deep Neural Networks in particular, have established themselves as the new norm in signal and data processing, achieving state-of-the-art performance in image, audio, and natural language understanding. In remote sensing, a large body of research has been devoted to the application of deep learning for typical supervised learning tasks such as classification. Less yet equally important effort has also been allocated to addressing the challenges associated with the enhancement of low-quality observations from remote sensing platforms. Addressing such channels is of paramount importance, both in itself, since high-altitude imaging, environmental conditions, and imaging systems trade-offs lead to low-quality observation, as well as to facilitate subsequent analysis, such as classification and detection. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of deep-learning methods for the enhancement of remote sensing observations, focusing on critical tasks including single and multi-band super-resolution, denoising, restoration, pan-sharpening, and fusion, among others. In addition to the detailed analysis and comparison of recently presented approaches, different research avenues which could be explored in the future are also discussed.","['1 Signal Processing Lab (SPL), Institute of Computer Science, Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas (FORTH), 70013 Crete, Greece. greg@ics.forth.gr.', '2 Computer Science Department, University of Crete, 70013 Crete, Greece. greg@ics.forth.gr.', '3 Signal Processing Lab (SPL), Institute of Computer Science, Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas (FORTH), 70013 Crete, Greece. aidini@csd.uoc.gr.', '4 Computer Science Department, University of Crete, 70013 Crete, Greece. aidini@csd.uoc.gr.', '5 Signal Processing Lab (SPL), Institute of Computer Science, Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas (FORTH), 70013 Crete, Greece. kfot@ics.forth.gr.', '6 Computer Science Department, University of Crete, 70013 Crete, Greece. kfot@ics.forth.gr.', '7 Signal Processing Lab (SPL), Institute of Computer Science, Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas (FORTH), 70013 Crete, Greece. mgiannop@ics.forth.gr.', '8 Computer Science Department, University of Crete, 70013 Crete, Greece. mgiannop@ics.forth.gr.', '9 Signal Processing Lab (SPL), Institute of Computer Science, Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas (FORTH), 70013 Crete, Greece. anpentari@gmail.com.', '10 Computer Science Department, University of Crete, 70013 Crete, Greece. anpentari@gmail.com.', '11 Signal Processing Lab (SPL), Institute of Computer Science, Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas (FORTH), 70013 Crete, Greece. tsakalid@ics.forth.gr.', '12 Computer Science Department, University of Crete, 70013 Crete, Greece. tsakalid@ics.forth.gr.']","Grigorios Tsagkatakis, Anastasia Aidini, Konstantina Fotiadou, Michalis Giannopoulos, Anastasia Pentari, Panagiotis Tsakalides, ","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019,convolutional neural networks; deep learning; denoising; earth observations; fusion; generative adversarial networks; pan-sharpening; satellite imaging; super-resolution.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31547250
1080,Exploring the Privacy-Preserving Properties of Word Embeddings: Algorithmic Validation Study,"Background:
      
    

    
      Word embeddings are dense numeric vectors used to represent language in neural networks. Until recently, there had been no publicly released embeddings trained on clinical data. Our work is the first to study the privacy implications of releasing these models. Objective:
      
    

    
      This paper aims to demonstrate that traditional word embeddings created on clinical corpora that have been deidentified by removing personal health information (PHI) can nonetheless be exploited to reveal sensitive patient information. Methods:
      
    

    
      We used embeddings created from 400,000 doctor-written consultation notes and experimented with 3 common word embedding methods to explore the privacy-preserving properties of each. Results:
      
    

    
      We found that if publicly released embeddings are trained from a corpus anonymized by PHI removal, it is possible to reconstruct up to 68.5% (n=411/600) of the full names that remain in the deidentified corpus and associated sensitive information to specific patients in the corpus from which the embeddings were created. We also found that the distance between the word vector representation of a patient's name and a diagnostic billing code is informative and differs significantly from the distance between the name and a code not billed for that patient. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Special care must be taken when sharing word embeddings created from clinical texts, as current approaches may compromise patient privacy. If PHI removal is used for anonymization before traditional word embeddings are trained, it is possible to attribute sensitive information to patients who have not been fully deidentified by the (necessarily imperfect) removal algorithms. A promising alternative (ie, anonymization by PHI replacement) may avoid these flaws. Our results are timely and critical, as an increasing number of researchers are pushing for publicly available health data.","['1 Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', '2 The Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Toronto, ON, Canada.', '3 Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, Toronto, ON, Canada.', '4 Deptartment of Statistics, Computational Statistics & Machine Learning Group, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', '5 Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Nuffield Dept of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', '6 Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States.', ""7 International Centre for Surgical Safety, Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute, St Michael's Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada."", '8 Surgical Safety Technologies Inc, Toronto, ON, Canada.']","Mohamed Abdalla, Moustafa Abdalla, Graeme Hirst, Frank Rudzicz, ",Journal of medical Internet research,2020,data anonymization; natural language processing; personal health records; privacy.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32673230
1081,Predictive modeling for trustworthiness and other subjective text properties in online nutrition and health communication,"While the internet has democratized and accelerated content creation and sharing, it has also made people more vulnerable to manipulation and misinformation. Also, the received information can be distorted by psychological biases. This is problematic especially in health-related communications which can greatly affect the quality of life of individuals. We assembled and analyzed 364 texts related to nutrition and health from Finnish online sources, such as news, columns and blogs, and asked non-experts to subjectively evaluate the texts. Texts were rated for their trustworthiness, sentiment, logic, information, clarity, and neutrality properties. We then estimated individual biases and consensus ratings that were used in training regression models. Firstly, we found that trustworthiness was significantly correlated to the information, neutrality and logic of the texts. Secondly, individual ratings for information and logic were significantly biased by the age and diet of the raters. Our best regression models explained up to 70% of the total variance of consensus ratings based on the low-level properties of texts, such as semantic embeddings, presence of key-terms and part-of-speech tags, references, quotes and paragraphs. With a novel combination of crowdsourcing, behavioral analysis, natural language processing and predictive modeling, our study contributes to the automated identification of reliable and high-quality online information. While critical evaluation of truthfulness cannot be surrendered to the machine only, our findings provide new insights into automated evaluation of subjective text properties and analysis of morphologically-rich languages in regards to trustworthiness.","['1 Digital Business, Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences, Helsinki, Finland.', '2 NeuroLab, Laurea University of Applied Sciences, Espoo, Finland.', '3 Enactive Virtuality Lab, Baltic Film, Media, Arts and Communication School, Tallinn University, Tallinn, Estonia.']","Janne Kauttonen, Jenni Hannukainen, Pia Tikka, Jyrki Suomala, ",PloS one,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32760095

      Delays in treatment for inflammatory arthritis (IA) are associated with unfavorable outcomes, including impaired quality of life, irreversible joint damage, and disability. Objective:
      
    

    
      To characterize treatment initiation patterns in veterans with newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), or ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Methods:
      
    

    
      ICD-9/10-CM codes and natural language processing were used to identify incident cases of RA, PsA, or AS between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2015, in patients enrolled in the Veterans Health Administration. Patterns of treatment initiation and nontreatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) were assessed in the 12-month follow-up period after the incident diagnosis. Outcomes included the percentage of veterans treated with a DMARD, the mean time to the initial DMARD after diagnosis, and the percentage of veterans who accessed rheumatology care before DMARD initiation. To assess outcomes over time, veterans were grouped by year of initial IA diagnosis. Additionally, outcomes were compared between nonbiologic and biologic DMARDs and among IA subtypes (RA, PsA, and AS). Groups were statistically compared with 95% confidence intervals. Results:
      
    

    
      The population consisted of 12,118 IA veterans (9,711 RA, 1,472 PsA, and 935 AS), with 91.3% males and a mean age of 63.7 years. The percentage of veterans treated with ≥ 1 DMARD (nonbiologic or biologic) during the 12-month follow-up period increased from 48.8% in 2007 to 66.4% in 2015. In veterans diagnosed with IA in 2015, DMARD treatment was more common for PsA patients (72.9%) and RA patients (68.6%) than for AS patients (28.9%). In the subset treated with a DMARD within 12 months after diagnosis, the mean time to the initial DMARD after diagnosis did not change throughout the observation period (35.5 days for RA, 43.9 days for PsA, and 59.5 days for AS). Rheumatology specialty care was accessed by 87.4% of veterans treated with a nonbiologic DMARD and 92.2% of veterans treated with a biologic DMARD, in patients diagnosed in 2015. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      DMARD treatment rates during the initial 12 months after diagnosis increased between 2007 and 2015, but nontreatment remained common, particularly in veterans with AS. The time to treatment after diagnosis was stable over time; it was shortest for RA, intermediate for PsA, and longest for AS. DMARD treatment was uncommon in veterans who did not access rheumatology specialty care. Disclosures:

1084,Representation of spatial sequences using nested rules in human prefrontal cortex,"Memory for spatial sequences does not depend solely on the number of locations to be stored, but also on the presence of spatial regularities. Here, we show that the human brain quickly stores spatial sequences by detecting geometrical regularities at multiple time scales and encoding them in a format akin to a programming language. We measured gaze-anticipation behavior while spatial sequences of variable regularity were repeated. Participants' behavior suggested that they quickly discovered the most compact description of each sequence in a language comprising nested rules, and used these rules to compress the sequence in memory and predict the next items. Activity in dorsal inferior prefrontal cortex correlated with the amount of compression, while right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex encoded the presence of embedded structures. Sequence learning was accompanied by a progressive differentiation of multi-voxel activity patterns in these regions. We propose that humans are endowed with a simple ""language of geometry"" which recruits a dorsal prefrontal circuit for geometrical rules, distinct from but close to areas involved in natural language processing.","['1 Institute of Neuroscience, Key Laboratory of Primate Neurobiology, CAS Center for Excellence in Brain Science and Intelligence Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 200031, China.

1085,Mapping anatomical related entities to human body parts based on wikipedia in discharge summaries,"*: Background Consisting of dictated free-text documents such as discharge summaries, medical narratives are widely used in medical natural language processing. Relationships between anatomical entities and human body parts are crucial for building medical text mining applications. To achieve this, we establish a mapping system consisting of a Wikipedia-based scoring algorithm and a named entity normalization method (NEN). The mapping system makes full use of information available on Wikipedia, which is a comprehensive Internet medical knowledge base. We also built a new ontology, Tree of Human Body Parts (THBP), from core anatomical parts by referring to anatomical experts and Unified Medical Language Systems (UMLS) to make the mapping system efficacious for clinical treatments. *: Result The gold standard is derived from 50 discharge summaries from our previous work, in which 2,224 anatomical entities are included. The F1-measure of the baseline system is 70.20%, while our algorithm based on Wikipedia achieves 86.67% with the assistance of NEN. *: Conclusions We construct a framework to map anatomical entities to THBP ontology using normalization and a scoring algorithm based on Wikipedia. The proposed framework is proven to be much more effective and efficient than the main baseline system.","['1 State Key Laboratory of Software Development Environment and Key Laboratory of Biomechanics and Mechanobiology of Ministry of Education and Research Institute of Beihang University in Shenzhen, Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Biomedical Engineering, Beihang University, Xueyuan Road No.37, Beijing, 100191, China.', '2 Bioengineering College of Chongqing University, Shazheng Street No. 174, Chongqing, 400044, China.', '3 Microsoft Research, Danling Street No. 5, Beijing, 100080, China.', '4 The National Centre for Text Mining, School of Computer Science, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', '5 Artificial Intelligence Research Center (AIRC), Tokyo, Japan.', '6 State Key Laboratory of Software Development Environment and Key Laboratory of Biomechanics and Mechanobiology of Ministry of Education and Research Institute of Beihang University in Shenzhen, Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Biomedical Engineering, Beihang University, Xueyuan Road No.37, Beijing, 100191, China. xuyan04@gmail.com.', '7 Microsoft Research, Danling Street No. 5, Beijing, 100080, China. xuyan04@gmail.com.']","Yipei Wang, Xingyu Fan, Luoxin Chen, Eric I-Chao Chang, Sophia Ananiadou, Junichi Tsujii, Yan Xu, ",BMC bioinformatics,2019,Anatomical entity; Human body parts; Named entity normalization; Natural language processing; Wikipedia.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31419946
1086,A context-based ABC model for literature-based discovery,"Background:
      
    

    
      In the literature-based discovery, considerable research has been done based on the ABC model developed by Swanson. ABC model hypothesizes that there is a meaningful relation between entity A extracted from document set 1 and entity C extracted from document set 2 through B entities that appear commonly in both document sets. The results of ABC model are relations among entity A, B, and C, which is referred as paths. A path allows for hypothesizing the relationship between entity A and entity C, or helps discover entity B as a new evidence for the relationship between entity A and entity C. The co-occurrence based approach of ABC model is a well-known approach to automatic hypothesis generation by creating various paths. However, the co-occurrence based ABC model has a limitation, in that biological context is not considered. It focuses only on matching of B entity which commonly appears in relation between two entities. Therefore, the paths extracted by the co-occurrence based ABC model tend to include a lot of irrelevant paths, meaning that expert verification is essential. Methods:
      
    

    
      In order to overcome this limitation of the co-occurrence based ABC model, we propose a context-based approach to connecting one entity relation to another, modifying the ABC model using biological contexts. In this study, we defined four biological context elements: cell, drug, disease, and organism. Based on these biological context, we propose two extended ABC models: a context-based ABC model and a context-assignment-based ABC model. In order to measure the performance of the both proposed models, we examined the relevance of the B entities between the well-known relations ""APOE-MAPT"" as well as ""FUS-TARDBP"". Each relation means interaction between neurodegenerative disease associated with proteins. The interaction between APOE and MAPT is known to play a crucial role in Alzheimer's disease as APOE affects tau-mediated neurodegeneration. It has been shown that mutation in FUS and TARDBP are associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis(ALS), a motor neuron disease by leading to neuronal cell death. Using these two relations, we compared both of proposed models to co-occurrence based ABC model. Results:
      
    

    
      The precision of B entities by co-occurrence based ABC model was 27.1% for ""APOE-MAPT"" and 22.1% for ""FUS-TARDBP"", respectively. In context-based ABC model, precision of extracted B entities was 71.4% for ""APOE-MAPT"", and 77.9% for ""FUS-TARDBP"". Context-assignment based ABC model achieved 89% and 97.5% precision for the two relations, respectively. Both proposed models achieved a higher precision than co-occurrence-based ABC model.","['1 Division of Humanities, CheongJu University, CheongJu, Korea.', '2 Department of Library and Information Science, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea.']","Yong Hwan Kim, Min Song, ",PloS one,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31017923
1087,Gender-based functional connectivity differences in brain networks in childhood,"Background and objective:
      
    

    
      Understanding the effect of gender differences on the brain can provide important information to characterize normal changes throughout life and to increase the likelihood of sex-specific approaches for neurological and psychiatric diseases. In this study, Functional Connectivity (FC), Amplitude of Low-Frequency Fluctuations (ALFF) and fractional ALFF (fALFF) analyzes will be compared between female and male brains between the ages of 7 and 18 years using resting state-functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Methods:
      
    

    
      The rs-fMRI data in this study has been provided by The New York University (NYU) Child Study Center of the publicly shared ADHD200 database. From the NYU dataset, 68 (34 females, 34 males) healthy subjects in the age range of 7-18 years were selected. The female group (mean age: 12.3271±3.1380) and male group (mean age: 11.8766±2.9697) consisted of right-handed, small head motion and similar IQ values. FC was obtained by seed voxel analysis and the effect of low-frequency fluctuations on gender was examined by ALFF and fALFF analyses. Two-sample t-test was used to compare female and male groups with the significance thresholds set to FDR-corrected p<0.05. Results:
      
    

    
      In the results of our study, both in the ALFF, fALFF analyses and the seed regions belonging to many network regions, higher FC rates were found in girls than boys. Our results show that the females' language functions, visual functions such as object detection and recognition, working memory, executive functions, and episodic memory are more developed than males in this age range. In addition, as another result of our study, the seed regions are statistically stronger where the higher activation of female participants than male participants has concentrated in the left hemisphere. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Gender differences in brain networks should be taken into consideration when examining childhood cognitive and neuropsychiatric disorders and the results should also be evaluated according to gender. Evaluation of gender differences in childhood can increase the likelihood of early and definitive diagnosis and correct treatment for neurological diseases and can help doctors and scientists find new diagnostic tools to discover brain differences.","['1 Biomedical Engineering Department, Engineering Faculty, Erciyes University, Kayseri, Turkey.

1088,Neural attention with character embeddings for hay fever detection from twitter,"The paper aims to leverage the highly unstructured user-generated content in the context of pollen allergy surveillance using neural networks with character embeddings and the attention mechanism. Currently, there is no accurate representation of hay fever prevalence, particularly in real-time scenarios. Social media serves as an alternative to extract knowledge about the condition, which is valuable for allergy sufferers, general practitioners, and policy makers. Despite tremendous potential offered, conventional natural language processing methods prove limited when exposed to the challenging nature of user-generated content. As a result, the detection of actual hay fever instances among the number of false positives, as well as the correct identification of non-technical expressions as pollen allergy symptoms poses a major problem. We propose a deep architecture enhanced with character embeddings and neural attention to improve the performance of hay fever-related content classification from Twitter data. Improvement in prediction is achieved due to the character-level semantics introduced, which effectively addresses the out-of-vocabulary problem in our dataset where the rate is approximately 9%. Overall, the study is a step forward towards improved real-time pollen allergy surveillance from social media with state-of-art technology.","['1 Institute of Sustainable Industries & Liveable Cities, Victoria University, Melbourne, VIC Australia.']","Jiahua Du, Sandra Michalska, Sudha Subramani, Hua Wang, Yanchun Zhang, ",Health information science and systems,2019,Deep learning; Hay fever; Pollen allergy; Twitter.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31656594
1089,An Exploration Into the Use of a Chatbot for Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: Retrospective Cohort Study,"Background:
      
    

    
      The emergence of chatbots in health care is fast approaching. Data on the feasibility of chatbots for chronic disease management are scarce. Objective:
      
    

    
      This study aimed to explore the feasibility of utilizing natural language processing (NLP) for the categorization of electronic dialog data of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) for use in the development of a chatbot. Methods:
      
    

    
      Electronic dialog data collected between 2013 and 2018 from a care management platform (UCLA eIBD) at a tertiary referral center for IBD at the University of California, Los Angeles, were used. Part of the data was manually reviewed, and an algorithm for categorization was created. The algorithm categorized all relevant dialogs into a set number of categories using NLP. In addition, 3 independent physicians evaluated the appropriateness of the categorization. Results:
      
    

    
      A total of 16,453 lines of dialog were collected and analyzed. We categorized 8324 messages from 424 patients into seven categories. As there was an overlap in these categories, their frequencies were measured independently as symptoms (2033/6193, 32.83%), medications (2397/6193, 38.70%), appointments (1518/6193, 24.51%), laboratory investigations (2106/6193, 34.01%), finance or insurance (447/6193, 7.22%), communications (2161/6193, 34.89%), procedures (617/6193, 9.96%), and miscellaneous (624/6193, 10.08%). Furthermore, in 95.0% (285/300) of cases, there were minor or no differences in categorization between the algorithm and the three independent physicians. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      With increased adaptation of electronic health technologies, chatbots could have great potential in interacting with patients, collecting data, and increasing efficiency. Our categorization showcases the feasibility of using NLP in large amounts of electronic dialog for the development of a chatbot algorithm.

Traditional alignment methods take advantage of attention mechanism. Attention mechanism, i.e. weighting technique, could pick out the most similar/dissimilar parts, but is weak in modeling the aligned unmatched parts, which are the crucial evidence to identify paraphrases. In this paper, we empower neural architecture with Hungarian algorithm to extract the aligned unmatched parts. Specifically, first, our model applies BiLSTM/BERT to encode the input sentences into hidden representations. Then, Hungarian layer leverages the hidden representations to extract the aligned unmatched parts. Last, we apply cosine similarity to metric the aligned unmatched parts for a final discrimination. Extensive experiments show that our model outperforms other baselines, substantially and significantly.","['1 Artificial Intelligence Department, School of Informatics, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China; Department of Information Communication Technology, Xiamen University Malaysia, Sepang, Malaysia.

1091,"Linguistic markers of autism in girls: evidence of a ""blended phenotype"" during storytelling","Background:
      
    

    
      Narrative abilities are linked to social impairment in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), such that reductions in words about cognitive processes (e.g., think, know) are thought to reflect underlying deficits in social cognition, including Theory of Mind. However, research suggests that typically developing (TD) boys and girls tell narratives in sex-specific ways, including differential reliance on cognitive process words. Given that most studies of narration in ASD have been conducted in predominantly male samples, it is possible that prior results showing reduced cognitive processing language in ASD may not generalize to autistic girls. To answer this question, we measured the relative frequency of two kinds of words in stories told by autistic girls and boys: nouns (words that indicate object-oriented storytelling) and cognitive process words (words like think and know that indicate mentalizing or attention to other peoples' internal states). Methods:
      
    

    
      One hundred two verbally fluent school-aged children [girls with ASD (N = 21) and TD (N = 19), and boys with ASD (N = 41) and TD (N = 21)] were matched on age, IQ, and maternal education. Children told a story from a sequence of pictures, and word frequencies (nouns, cognitive process words) were compared. Results:
      
    

    
      Autistic children of both sexes consistently produced a greater number of nouns than TD controls, indicating object-focused storytelling. There were no sex differences in cognitive process word use in the TD group, but autistic girls produced significantly more cognitive process words than autistic boys, despite comparable autism symptom severity. Thus, autistic girls showed a unique narrative profile that overlapped with autistic boys and typical girls/boys. Noun use correlated significantly with parent reports of social symptom severity in all groups, but cognitive process word use correlated with social ability in boys only. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      This study extends prior research on autistic children's storytelling by measuring sex differences in the narratives of a relatively large, well-matched sample of children with and without ASD. Importantly, prior research showing that autistic children use fewer cognitive process words is true for boys only, while object-focused language is a sex-neutral linguistic marker of ASD. These findings suggest that sex-sensitive screening and diagnostic methods-preferably using objective metrics like natural language processing-may be helpful for identifying autistic girls, and could guide the development of future personalized treatment strategies.","['1 1Lehigh University, College of Education, 111 Research Drive, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA.', ""2 2Center for Autism Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, 2716 South St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA."", '3 3Department of Psychology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA.', '4 4Department of Psychiatry, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA.', '5 5Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA.']","Jaclin Boorse, Meredith Cola, Samantha Plate, Lisa Yankowitz, Juhi Pandey, Robert T Schultz, Julia Parish-Morris, ",Molecular autism,2019,Autism spectrum disorder; Mentalizing; Narratives; Natural language processing; Sex differences; Social cognition; Storytelling; Word choice.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30962869
1092,Natural Language Processing of Clinical Notes on Chronic Diseases: Systematic Review,"Background:
      
    

    
      Novel approaches that complement and go beyond evidence-based medicine are required in the domain of chronic diseases, given the growing incidence of such conditions on the worldwide population. A promising avenue is the secondary use of electronic health records (EHRs), where patient data are analyzed to conduct clinical and translational research. Methods based on machine learning to process EHRs are resulting in improved understanding of patient clinical trajectories and chronic disease risk prediction, creating a unique opportunity to derive previously unknown clinical insights. However, a wealth of clinical histories remains locked behind clinical narratives in free-form text. Consequently, unlocking the full potential of EHR data is contingent on the development of natural language processing (NLP) methods to automatically transform clinical text into structured clinical data that can guide clinical decisions and potentially delay or prevent disease onset. Objective:
      
    

    
      The goal of the research was to provide a comprehensive overview of the development and uptake of NLP methods applied to free-text clinical notes related to chronic diseases, including the investigation of challenges faced by NLP methodologies in understanding clinical narratives. Methods:
      
    

    
      Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed and searches were conducted in 5 databases using ""clinical notes,"" ""natural language processing,"" and ""chronic disease"" and their variations as keywords to maximize coverage of the articles. Results:
      
    

    
      Of the 2652 articles considered, 106 met the inclusion criteria. Review of the included papers resulted in identification of 43 chronic diseases, which were then further classified into 10 disease categories using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision. The majority of studies focused on diseases of the circulatory system (n=38) while endocrine and metabolic diseases were fewest (n=14). This was due to the structure of clinical records related to metabolic diseases, which typically contain much more structured data, compared with medical records for diseases of the circulatory system, which focus more on unstructured data and consequently have seen a stronger focus of NLP. The review has shown that there is a significant increase in the use of machine learning methods compared to rule-based approaches; however, deep learning methods remain emergent (n=3). Consequently, the majority of works focus on classification of disease phenotype with only a handful of papers addressing extraction of comorbidities from the free text or integration of clinical notes with structured data. There is a notable use of relatively simple methods, such as shallow classifiers (or combination with rule-based methods), due to the interpretability of predictions, which still represents a significant issue for more complex methods. Finally, scarcity of publicly available data may also have contributed to insufficient development of more advanced methods, such as extraction of word embeddings from clinical notes. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Efforts are still required to improve (1) progression of clinical NLP methods from extraction toward understanding; (2) recognition of relations among entities rather than entities in isolation; (3) temporal extraction to understand past, current, and future clinical events; (4) exploitation of alternative sources of clinical knowledge; and (5) availability of large-scale, de-identified clinical corpora.","['1 eHealth Research Group, Fondazione Bruno Kessler Research Institute, Trento, Italy.', '2 Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science, University of Trento, Trento, Italy.', '3 Institute for Next Generation Healthcare, Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, United States.', '4 NLP Research Group, Fondazione Bruno Kessler Research Institute, Trento, Italy.', '5 Institute of Computational Linguistics, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.']","Seyedmostafa Sheikhalishahi, Riccardo Miotto, Joel T Dudley, Alberto Lavelli, Fabio Rinaldi, Venet Osmani, ",JMIR medical informatics,2019,cancer; chronic diseases; clinical notes; deep learning; diabetes; electronic health records; heart disease; lung disease; machine learning; natural language processing; stroke.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31066697

      Chinese word segmentation (CWS) and part-of-speech (POS) tagging are two fundamental tasks of Chinese text processing. They are usually preliminary steps for lots of Chinese natural language processing (NLP) tasks. There have been a large number of studies on CWS and POS tagging in various domains, however, few studies have been proposed for CWS and POS tagging in the clinical domain as it is not easy to determine granularity of words. Methods:
      
    

    
      In this paper, we investigated CWS and POS tagging for Chinese clinical text at a fine-granularity level, and manually annotated a corpus. On the corpus, we compared two state-of-the-art methods, i.e., conditional random fields (CRF) and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) with a CRF layer. In order to validate the plausibility of the fine-grained annotation, we further investigated the effect of CWS and POS tagging on Chinese clinical named entity recognition (NER) on another independent corpus. Results:
      
    

    
      When only CWS was considered, CRF achieved higher precision, recall and F-measure than BiLSTM-CRF. When both CWS and POS tagging were considered, CRF also gained an advantage over BiLSTM. CRF outperformed BiLSTM-CRF by 0.14% in F-measure on CWS and by 0.34% in F-measure on POS tagging. The CWS information brought a greatest improvement of 0.34% in F-measure, while the CWS&POS information brought a greatest improvement of 0.74% in F-measure. Conclusions:

Other clinical applications are reviewed, including forecasting suicide risk and detecting intoxication. Challenges and future directions are discussed, including biomarker development, harmonization, and application of NLP more broadly to behavior, including intonation/prosody, facial expression and gesture, and the integration of these in dyads and during discourse.

1097,Characterization of patients with advanced chronic pancreatitis using natural language processing of radiology reports,"Study aim:
      
    

    
      To develop and apply a natural language processing algorithm for characterization of patients diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis in a diverse integrated U.S. healthcare system. Methods:
      
    

    
      Retrospective cohort study including patients initially diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis (CP) within a regional integrated healthcare system between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2015. Imaging reports from these patients were extracted from the electronic medical record system and split into training, validation and implementation datasets. A natural language processing (NLP) algorithm was first developed through the training dataset to identify specific features (atrophy, calcification, pseudocyst, cyst and main duct dilatation) from free-text radiology reports. The validation dataset was applied to validate the performance by comparing against the manual chart review. The developed algorithm was then applied to the implementation dataset. We classified patients with calcification(s) or ≥2 radiographic features as advanced CP. We compared etiology, comorbid conditions, treatment parameters as well as survival between advanced CP and others diagnosed during the study period. Results:
      
    

    
      6,346 patients were diagnosed with CP during the study period with 58,085 radiology studies performed. For individual features, NLP yielded sensitivity from 88.7% to 95.3%, specificity from 98.2% to 100.0%. A total of 3,672 patients met cohort inclusion criteria: 1,330 (36.2%) had evidence of advanced CP. Patients with advanced CP had increased frequency of smoking (57.8% vs. 43.0%), diabetes (47.6% vs. 35.9%) and underweight body mass index (6.6% vs. 3.6%), all p<0.001. Mortality from pancreatic cancer was higher in advanced CP (15.3/1,000 person-year vs. 2.8/1,000, p<0.001). Underweight BMI (HR 1.6, 95% CL 1.2, 2.1), smoking (HR 1.4, 95% CL 1.1, 1.7) and diabetes (HR 1.4, 95% CL 1.2, 1.6) were independent risk factors for mortality. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Patients with advanced CP experienced increased disease-related complications and pancreatic cancer-related mortality. Excess all-cause mortality was driven primarily by potentially modifiable risk factors including malnutrition, smoking and diabetes.","['1 Research & Evaluation, Kaiser Permanente Southern California, Pasadena, California, United States of America.', '2 Department of Radiology, Kaiser Permanente Los Angeles Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, United States of America.', '3 Center for Pancreatic Care, Division of Gastroenterology, Kaiser Permanente Los Angeles Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, United States of America.']","Fagen Xie, Qiaoling Chen, Yichen Zhou, Wansu Chen, Jemianne Bautista, Emilie T Nguyen, Rex A Parker, Bechien U Wu, ",PloS one,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32813684
1098,A clinical text classification paradigm using weak supervision and deep representation,"Background:
      
    

    
      Automatic clinical text classification is a natural language processing (NLP) technology that unlocks information embedded in clinical narratives. Machine learning approaches have been shown to be effective for clinical text classification tasks. However, a successful machine learning model usually requires extensive human efforts to create labeled training data and conduct feature engineering. In this study, we propose a clinical text classification paradigm using weak supervision and deep representation to reduce these human efforts. Methods:
      
    

    
      We develop a rule-based NLP algorithm to automatically generate labels for the training data, and then use the pre-trained word embeddings as deep representation features for training machine learning models. Since machine learning is trained on labels generated by the automatic NLP algorithm, this training process is called weak supervision. We evaluat the paradigm effectiveness on two institutional case studies at Mayo Clinic: smoking status classification and proximal femur (hip) fracture classification, and one case study using a public dataset: the i2b2 2006 smoking status classification shared task. We test four widely used machine learning models, namely, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks (MLPNN), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), using this paradigm. Precision, recall, and F1 score are used as metrics to evaluate performance. Results:
      
    

    
      CNN achieves the best performance in both institutional tasks (F1 score: 0.92 for Mayo Clinic smoking status classification and 0.97 for fracture classification). We show that word embeddings significantly outperform tf-idf and topic modeling features in the paradigm, and that CNN captures additional patterns from the weak supervision compared to the rule-based NLP algorithms. We also observe two drawbacks of the proposed paradigm that CNN is more sensitive to the size of training data, and that the proposed paradigm might not be effective for complex multiclass classification tasks. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The proposed clinical text classification paradigm could reduce human efforts of labeled training data creation and feature engineering for applying machine learning to clinical text classification by leveraging weak supervision and deep representation. The experimental experiments have validated the effectiveness of paradigm by two institutional and one shared clinical text classification tasks.","['1 Division of Biomedical Statistics and Informatics, Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, 200 1st ST SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA. wang.yanshan@mayo.edu.', '2 Division of Biomedical Statistics and Informatics, Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, 200 1st ST SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.', '3 Division of Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, 200 1st ST SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.', '4 Division of Epidemiology, Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, 200 1st ST SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.', '5 Division of Biomedical Statistics and Informatics, Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, 200 1st ST SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA. liu.hongfang@mayo.edu.']","Yanshan Wang, Sunghwan Sohn, Sijia Liu, Feichen Shen, Liwei Wang, Elizabeth J Atkinson, Shreyasee Amin, Hongfang Liu, ",BMC medical informatics and decision making,2019,Clinical text classification; Electronic health records; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Weak supervision.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30616584
1099,Evaluating Patient Experiences in Dry Eye Disease Through Social Media Listening Research,"Introduction:
      
    

    
      Social media listening (SML) is an approach to assess patient experience in different indications. This is the first study to report the results of using SML to understand patients' experiences of living with dry eye disease (DED). Methods:
      
    

    
      Publicly available, English-language social media content between December 2016 and August 2017 was searched employing pre-defined criteria using Social Studio®, an online aggregator-tool for posts from social media channels. Using natural language processing (NLP), posts were indexed using patient lexicon and disease-related keywords to derive a set of patient posts. NLP was used to identify relevance, followed by further manual evaluation and analysis to generate patient insights. Results:
      
    

    
      In all, 2279 possible patient records were identified following NLP, which were filtered for relevance to disease area by analysts, resulting in a total of 1192 posts which formed the basis of this study. Of these, 77% (n = 915) were from the USA. Symptoms, causes, diagnosis and treatments were the most commonly discussed themes. Most common symptoms mentioned were eye dryness (138/901), pain (114/901) and blurry vision (110/901). Pharmaceutical drugs (prescription and over-the-counter; 55%; 764/1393), followed by medical devices (20%; 280/1393), were mentioned as major options for managing symptoms. Of the pharmaceutical drugs, eye drops (33%; 158/476) and artificial tears (10%; 49/476) were the most common over-the-counter options reported, and Restasis® (22%; 103/476) and Xiidra® (6%; 27/476) were the most common prescription drugs. Patients voiced a significant impact of DED on their daily activities (4%; 9/224), work (23%; 51/224) and driving (12%; 26/224). Lack of DED specialists, standard diagnostic procedures, effective treatment options and need to increase awareness of DED among patients were identified as the key unmet needs. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Insights revealed using SML strengthen our understanding about patient experiences and their unmet needs in DED. This study illustrates that an SML approach contributed effectively in generating patient insights, which can be utilised to inform early drug development process, market access strategies and stakeholder discussions.

1100,Adverse drug event rates in pediatric pulmonary hypertension: a comparison of real-world data sources,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Real-world data (RWD) are increasingly used for pharmacoepidemiology and regulatory innovation. Our objective was to compare adverse drug event (ADE) rates determined from two RWD sources, electronic health records and administrative claims data, among children treated with drugs for pulmonary hypertension. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      Textual mentions of medications and signs/symptoms that may represent ADEs were identified in clinical notes using natural language processing. Diagnostic codes for the same signs/symptoms were identified in our electronic data warehouse for the patients with textual evidence of taking pulmonary hypertension-targeted drugs. We compared rates of ADEs identified in clinical notes to those identified from diagnostic code data. In addition, we compared putative ADE rates from clinical notes to those from a healthcare claims dataset from a large, national insurer. Results:
      
    

    
      Analysis of clinical notes identified up to 7-fold higher ADE rates than those ascertained from diagnostic codes. However, certain ADEs (eg, hearing loss) were more often identified in diagnostic code data. Similar results were found when ADE rates ascertained from clinical notes and national claims data were compared. Discussion:
      
    

    
      While administrative claims and clinical notes are both increasingly used for RWD-based pharmacovigilance, ADE rates substantially differ depending on data source. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Pharmacovigilance based on RWD may lead to discrepant results depending on the data source analyzed. Further work is needed to confirm the validity of identified ADEs, to distinguish them from disease effects, and to understand tradeoffs in sensitivity and specificity between data sources.","[""1 Computational Health Informatics Program, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."", ""2 Division of Critical Care Medicine, Department of Anesthesiology, Critical Care, and Pain Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."", '3 Department of Anaesthesia, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', ""4 Division of Pediatric Pulmonary Medicine, Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, Colorado, USA."", '5 Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado, USA.', ""6 Division of Genetics & Genomics, Clinical Pharmacogenomics Service, Department of Pharmacy, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."", '7 Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', ""8 Division of Cardiology, Heart Institute, Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, Colorado, USA."", ""9 Department of Cardiology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."", '10 Department of Biomedical Informatics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']","Alon Geva, Steven H Abman, Shannon F Manzi, Dunbar D Ivy, Mary P Mullen, John Griffin, Chen Lin, Guergana K Savova, Kenneth D Mandl, ",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2020,administrative claims; adverse drug event; healthcare; hypertension; natural language processing; pulmonary.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31769835
1101,Discovering associations between problem list and practice setting,"Background:
      
    

    
      The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) has greatly accelerated the adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) with the promise of better clinical decisions and patients' outcomes. One of the core criteria for ""Meaningful Use"" of EHRs is to have a problem list that shows the most important health problems faced by a patient. The implementation of problem lists in EHRs has a potential to help practitioners to provide customized care to patients. However, it remains an open question on how to leverage problem lists in different practice settings to provide tailored care, of which the bottleneck lies in the associations between problem list and practice setting. Methods:
      
    

    
      In this study, using sampled clinical documents associated with a cohort of patients who received their primary care at Mayo Clinic, we investigated the associations between problem list and practice setting through natural language processing (NLP) and topic modeling techniques. Specifically, after practice settings and problem lists were normalized, statistical χ2 test, term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) and enrichment analysis were used to choose representative concepts for each setting. Then Latent Dirichlet Allocations (LDA) were used to train topic models and predict potential practice settings using similarity metrics based on the problem concepts representative of practice settings. Evaluation was conducted through 5-fold cross validation and Recall@k, Precision@k and F1@k were calculated. Results:
      
    

    
      Our method can generate prioritized and meaningful problem lists corresponding to specific practice settings. For practice setting prediction, recall increases from 0.719 (k = 2) to 0.931 (k = 10), precision increases from 0.882 (k = 2) to 0.931 (k = 10) and F1 increases from 0.790 (k = 2) to 0.931 (k = 10). Conclusion:
      
    

    
      To our best knowledge, our study is the first attempting to discover the association between the problem lists and hospital practice settings. In the future, we plan to investigate how to provide more tailored care by utilizing the association between problem list and practice setting revealed in this study.","['1 Division of Digital Health Sciences, Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.', '2 Division of Digital Health Sciences, Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA. liu.hongfang@mayo.edu.']","Liwei Wang, Yanshan Wang, Feichen Shen, Majid Rastegar-Mojarad, Hongfang Liu, ",BMC medical informatics and decision making,2019,Practice setting; Problem list; Statistical χ2 test; TF-IDF and enrichment analysis; Topic modeling.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30943957

1103,Information on adverse drug reactions-Proof of principle for a structured database that allows customization of drug information,"Background:
      
    

    
      The drug information most commonly requested by patients is to learn more about potential adverse drug reactions (ADRs) of their drugs. Such information should be customizable to individual information needs. While approaches to automatically aggregate ADRs by text-mining processes and establishment of respective databases are well known, further efforts to map additional ADR information are sparse, yet crucial for customization. In a proof-of-principle (PoP) study, we developed a database format demonstrating that natural language processing can further structure ADR information in a way that facilitates customization. Methods:
      
    

    
      We developed the database in a 3-step process: (1) initial ADR extraction, (2) mapping of additional ADR information, and (3) review process. ADRs of 10 frequently prescribed active ingredients were initially extracted from their Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) by text-mining processes and mapped to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terms. To further structure ADR information, we mapped 7 additional ADR characteristics (i.e. frequency, organ class, seriousness, lay perceptibility, onset, duration, and management strategies) to individual ADRs. In a PoP study, the process steps were assessed and tested. Initial ADR extraction was assessed by measuring precision, recall, and F1-scores (i.e. harmonic mean of precision and recall). Mapping of additional ADR information was assessed considering pre-defined parameters (i.e. correctness, errors, and misses) regarding the mapped ADR characteristics. Results:
      
    

    
      Overall the SmPCs listed 393 ADRs with an average of 39.3 ± 18.1 ADRs per SmPC. For initial ADR extraction precision was 97.9% and recall was 93.2% leading to an F1-score of 95.5%. Regarding mapping of additional ADR information, the frequency information of 28.6 ± 18.4 ADRs for each SmPC was correctly mapped (72.8%). Overall 77 ADRs (20.6%) of the correctly extracted ADRs did not have a concise frequency stated in the SmPC and were consequently mapped with 'frequency not known'. Mapping of remaining ADR characteristics did not result in noteworthy errors or misses. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      ADR information can be automatically extracted and mapped to corresponding MedDRA terms. Additionally, ADR information can be further structured considering additional ADR characteristics to facilitate customization to individual patient needs.","['1 Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacoepidemiology, University of Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 410, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany; Cooperation Unit Clinical Pharmacy, University of Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 410, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.

1104,Biomedical word sense disambiguation with bidirectional long short-term memory and attention-based neural networks,"Background:
      
    

    
      In recent years, deep learning methods have been applied to many natural language processing tasks to achieve state-of-the-art performance. However, in the biomedical domain, they have not out-performed supervised word sense disambiguation (WSD) methods based on support vector machines or random forests, possibly due to inherent similarities of medical word senses. Results:
      
    

    
      In this paper, we propose two deep-learning-based models for supervised WSD: a model based on bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network, and an attention model based on self-attention architecture. Our result shows that the BiLSTM neural network model with a suitable upper layer structure performs even better than the existing state-of-the-art models on the MSH WSD dataset, while our attention model was 3 or 4 times faster than our BiLSTM model with good accuracy. In addition, we trained ""universal"" models in order to disambiguate all ambiguous words together. That is, we concatenate the embedding of the target ambiguous word to the max-pooled vector in the universal models, acting as a ""hint"". The result shows that our universal BiLSTM neural network model yielded about 90 percent accuracy. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Deep contextual models based on sequential information processing methods are able to capture the relative contextual information from pre-trained input word embeddings, in order to provide state-of-the-art results for supervised biomedical WSD tasks.","['1 Department of Mathematics, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, US.', '2 Department of Computer Science, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, US.', '3 School of Information, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, US. zhe.he@cci.fsu.edu.']","Canlin Zhang, Daniel Biś, Xiuwen Liu, Zhe He, ",BMC bioinformatics,2019,Biomedical; LSTM; Self-attention; Word sense disambiguation.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31787096
1105,Neocortical activity tracks the hierarchical linguistic structures of self-produced speech during reading aloud,"How the human brain uses self-generated auditory information during speech production is rather unsettled. Current theories of language production consider a feedback monitoring system that monitors the auditory consequences of speech output and an internal monitoring system, which makes predictions about the auditory consequences of speech before its production. To gain novel insights into underlying neural processes, we investigated the coupling between neuromagnetic activity and the temporal envelope of the heard speech sounds (i.e., cortical tracking of speech) in a group of adults who 1) read a text aloud, 2) listened to a recording of their own speech (i.e., playback), and 3) listened to another speech recording. Reading aloud was here used as a particular form of speech production that shares various processes with natural speech. During reading aloud, the reader's brain tracked the slow temporal fluctuations of the speech output. Specifically, auditory cortices tracked phrases (<1 ​Hz) but to a lesser extent than during the two speech listening conditions. Also, the tracking of words (2-4 ​Hz) and syllables (4-8 ​Hz) occurred at parietal opercula during reading aloud and at auditory cortices during listening. Directionality analyses were then used to get insights into the monitoring systems involved in the processing of self-generated auditory information. Analyses revealed that the cortical tracking of speech at <1 ​Hz, 2-4 ​Hz and 4-8 ​Hz is dominated by speech-to-brain directional coupling during both reading aloud and listening, i.e., the cortical tracking of speech during reading aloud mainly entails auditory feedback processing. Nevertheless, brain-to-speech directional coupling at 4-8 ​Hz was enhanced during reading aloud compared with listening, likely reflecting the establishment of predictions about the auditory consequences of speech before production. These data bring novel insights into how auditory verbal information is tracked by the human brain during perception and self-generation of connected speech.","['1 BCBL, Basque Center on Cognition, Brain and Language, 20009, San Sebastian, Spain; Laboratoire de Cartographie Fonctionnelle du Cerveau, UNI - ULB Neuroscience Institute, Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Brussels, Belgium; Laboratoire Cognition Langage et Développement, UNI - ULB Neuroscience Institute, Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Brussels, Belgium.

1107,Brain dynamics and connectivity networks under natural auditory stimulation,"The analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is challenging when subjects are under exposure to natural sensory stimulation. In this study, a two-stage approach was developed to enable the identification of connectivity networks involved in the processing of information in the brain under natural sensory stimulation. In the first stage, the degree of concordance between the results of inter-subject and intra-subject correlation analyses is assessed statistically. The microstructurally (i.e., cytoarchitectonically) defined brain areas are designated either as concordant in which the results of both correlation analyses are in agreement, or as discordant in which one analysis method shows a higher proportion of supra-threshold voxels than does the other. In the second stage, connectivity networks are identified using the time courses of supra-threshold voxels in brain areas contingent upon the classifications derived in the first stage. In an empirical study, fMRI data were collected from 40 young adults (19 males, average age 22.76 ± 3.25), who underwent auditory stimulation involving sound clips of human voices and animal vocalizations under two operational conditions (i.e., eyes-closed and eyes-open). The operational conditions were designed to assess confounding effects due to auditory instructions or visual perception. The proposed two-stage analysis demonstrated that stress modulation (affective) and language networks in the limbic and cortical structures were respectively engaged during sound stimulation, and presented considerable variability among subjects. The network involved in regulating visuomotor control was sensitive to the eyes-open instruction, and presented only small variations among subjects. A high degree of concordance was observed between the two analyses in the primary auditory cortex which was highly sensitive to the pitch of sound clips. Our results have indicated that brain areas can be identified as concordant or discordant based on the two correlation analyses. This may further facilitate the search for connectivity networks involved in the processing of information under natural sensory stimulation.","['1 Institute of Statistical Science, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.', '2 Department of Electrical Engineering, Fu Jen Catholic University, New Taipei City, Taiwan.', '3 Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine (INM-1), Research Centre Jülich, Jülich, Germany.', '4 Institute of Systems Neuroscience, Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany; Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine (INM-7), Research Centre Jülich, Jülich, Germany.', '5 Graduate Institute of Business Administration, National Chengchi University, Taipei, Taiwan.', '6 Institute of Statistical Science, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.

1108,Is the consonant bias specifically human? Long-Evans rats encode vowels better than consonants in words,"In natural languages, vowels tend to convey structures (syntax, prosody) while consonants are more important lexically. The consonant bias, which is the tendency to rely more on consonants than on vowels to process words, is well attested in human adults and infants after the first year of life. Is the consonant bias based on evolutionarily ancient mechanisms, potentially present in other species? The current study investigated this issue in a species phylogenetically distant from humans: Long-Evans rats. During training, the animals were presented with four natural word-forms (e.g., mano, ""hand""). We then compared their responses to novel words carrying either a consonant (pano) or a vowel change (meno). Results show that the animals were less disrupted by consonantal alterations than by vocalic alterations of words. That is, word recognition was more affected by the alteration of a vowel than a consonant. Together with previous findings in very young human infants, this reliance on vocalic information we observe in rats suggests that the emergence of the consonant bias may require a combination of vocal, cognitive and auditory skills that rodents do not seem to possess.","['1 Center for Brain and Cognition, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Carrer Ramon Trias Fargas, 25-27, 08005, Barcelona, Spain. camillia.bouchon@gmail.com.', '2 Laboratoire Ethologie Cognition Développement, University Paris Nanterre, Nanterre, France. camillia.bouchon@gmail.com.', '3 Center for Brain and Cognition, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Carrer Ramon Trias Fargas, 25-27, 08005, Barcelona, Spain.', '4 ICREA, Barcelona, Spain.']","Camillia Bouchon, Juan M Toro, ",Animal cognition,2019 Sep,Comparative cognition; Consonant bias; Lexical processing; Operant conditioning.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31222546
1109,Comparing Different Methods for Named Entity Recognition in Portuguese Neurology Text,"Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) are written in an unstructured way, often using natural language. Information Extraction (IE) may be used for acquiring knowledge from such texts, including the automatic recognition of meaningful entities, through models for Named Entity Recognition (NER). However, while most work on the previous was made for English, this experience aimed at testing different methods in Portuguese text, more precisely, on the domain of Neurology, and take some conclusions. This paper comprised the comparison between Conditional Random Fields (CRF), bidirectional Long Short-term Memory - Conditional Random Fields (BiLSTM-CRF) and a BiLSTM-CRF with residual learning connections, using not only Portuguese texts from medical journals but also texts from the Coimbra Hospital and Universitary Centre (CHUC) Neurology Service. Furthermore, the performances of BiLSTM-CRF models using word embeddings (WEs) trained with clinical text and WEs trained with general language texts were compared. Deep learning models achieved F1-Scores of nearly 83% and 75%, respectively for relaxed and strict evaluation, on texts extracted from the medical journal. For texts collected from the Hospital, the same achieved F1-Scores of nearly 71% and 62%. This work concludes that deep learning models outperform the shallow learning models and that in-domain WEs get better results than general language WEs, even when the latter are trained with much more text than the former. Furthermore, the results show that it is possible to extract information from Hospital clinical texts with models trained with clinical cases extracted from medical journals, and thus openly available. Nevertheless, such results still require a healthcare technician to check if the information is well extracted.","['1 Center for Informatics and Systems, Department of Informatics Engineering, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal. fadcl@student.dei.uc.pt.', '2 Center for Informatics and Systems, Department of Informatics Engineering, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal.']","Fábio Lopes, César Teixeira, Hugo Gonçalo Oliveira, ",Journal of medical systems,2020,Machine learning; Named entity recognition; Natural language processing; Portuguese clinical text.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32112285
1110,Phase-amplitude coupling between theta and gamma oscillations adapts to speech rate,"Low- and high-frequency cortical oscillations play an important role in speech processing. Low-frequency neural oscillations in the delta (<4 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz) bands entrain to the prosodic and syllabic rates of speech, respectively. Theta band neural oscillations modulate high-frequency neural oscillations in the gamma band (28-40 Hz), which have been hypothesized to be crucial for processing phonemes in natural speech. Since speech rate is known to vary considerably, both between and within talkers, it has yet to be determined whether this nested gamma response reflects an externally induced rhythm sensitive to the rate of the fine-grained structure of the input or a speech rate-independent endogenous response. Here, we recorded magnetoencephalography responses from participants listening to a speech delivered at different rates: decelerated, normal, and accelerated. We found that the phase of theta band oscillations in left and right auditory regions adjusts to speech rate variations. Importantly, we showed that the peak of the gamma response-coupled to the phase of theta-follows the speech rate. This indicates that gamma activity in auditory regions synchronizes with the fine-grain properties of speech, possibly reflecting detailed acoustic analysis of the input.","['1 BCBL, Basque Center on Cognition, Brain and Language, Donostia/San Sebastian, Spain.', ""2 Laboratoire de Sciences Cognitives et Psycholinguistique, Dept d'Etudes Cognitives, ENS, PSL University, EHESS, CNRS, Paris, France."", '3 Ikerbasque, Basque Foundation for Science, Bilbao, Spain.']","Mikel Lizarazu, Marie Lallier, Nicola Molinaro, ",Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,2019 Oct,auditory regions; magnetoencephalography; neural oscillations; speech rate.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31020680
1111,Short-term numerosity training promotes symbolic arithmetic in children with developmental dyscalculia: The mediating role of visual form perception,"Studies have shown that numerosity-based arithmetic training can promote arithmetic learning in typically developing children as well as children with developmental dyscalculia (DD), but the cognitive mechanism underlying this training effect remains unclear. The main aim of the current study was to examine the role of visual form perception in arithmetic improvement through an 8-day numerosity training for DD children. Eighty DD children were selected from four Chinese primary schools. They were randomly divided into the intervention and control groups. The intervention group received training on an apple-collecting game, whereas the control group received an English dictation task. Children's cognitive and arithmetic performances were assessed before and after training. The results showed that the intervention group showed a significant improvement in arithmetic performance, approximate number system (ANS) acuity, and visual form perception, but not in spatial processing and sentence comprehension. The control group showed no significant improvement in any cognitive ability. Mediation analysis further showed that training-related improvement in arithmetic performance was fully mediated by the improvement in visual form perception. The results suggest that short-term numerosity training enhances the arithmetic performance of DD children by improving their visual form perception.","['1 State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning & IDG/McGovern Institute for Brain Research, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China.', '2 Advanced Innovation Center for Future Education, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China.', '3 Department of Pediatric Neurology, Capital Institute of Pediatrics, Beijing, China.', '4 Chinese Teaching Department, Beijing Chinese Language and Culture College, Beijing, China.', '5 Department of Psychology, College of Education, Hebei Normal University, Shijiazhuang, China.', '6 Department of Psychological Science, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA.', '7 Business School, Beijing Wuzi University, Beijing, China.']","Dazhi Cheng, Qing Xiao, Jiaxin Cui, Chuansheng Chen, Jieying Zeng, Qian Chen, Xinlin Zhou, ",Developmental science,2020 Jul,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31599035
1112,IL4I1 Is a Metabolic Immune Checkpoint that Activates the AHR and Promotes Tumor Progression,"Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) activation by tryptophan (Trp) catabolites enhances tumor malignancy and suppresses anti-tumor immunity. The context specificity of AHR target genes has so far impeded systematic investigation of AHR activity and its upstream enzymes across human cancers. A pan-tissue AHR signature, derived by natural language processing, revealed that across 32 tumor entities, interleukin-4-induced-1 (IL4I1) associates more frequently with AHR activity than IDO1 or TDO2, hitherto recognized as the main Trp-catabolic enzymes. IL4I1 activates the AHR through the generation of indole metabolites and kynurenic acid. It associates with reduced survival in glioma patients, promotes cancer cell motility, and suppresses adaptive immunity, thereby enhancing the progression of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in mice. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) induces IDO1 and IL4I1. As IDO1 inhibitors do not block IL4I1, IL4I1 may explain the failure of clinical studies combining ICB with IDO1 inhibition. Taken together, IL4I1 blockade opens new avenues for cancer therapy.","['1 DKTK Brain Cancer Metabolism Group, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), 69120 Heidelberg, Germany; Faculty of Bioscience, Heidelberg University, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', '2 DKTK Brain Cancer Metabolism Group, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), 69120 Heidelberg, Germany; Faculty of Bioscience, Heidelberg University, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, University of Costa Rica (UCR), 11501-2060 San José, Costa Rica.', '3 Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', '4 DKTK Brain Cancer Metabolism Group, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), 69120 Heidelberg, Germany; Neurology Clinic and National Center for Tumor Diseases, Heidelberg University Hospital, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', '5 DKTK Brain Cancer Metabolism Group, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', '6 Department of Environmental Immunology, Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research-UFZ, 04318 Leipzig, Germany; Institute of Organic Chemistry, Technical University Bergakademie Freiberg, 09596 Freiberg, Germany.', '7 Jena University Language & Information Engineering (JULIE) Lab, Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena, 07743 Jena, Germany.', '8 Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacoepidemiology, Heidelberg University Hospital, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', '9 Center for Mass Spectrometry and Optical Spectroscopy (CeMOS), Mannheim University of Applied Sciences, 68163 Mannheim, Germany.', '10 Institute of Pharmacy and Molecular Biotechnology, Heidelberg University, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany; AgroBioSciences Research Division, Mohammed VI Polytechnic University, 43150 Ben-Guerir, Morocco.', '11 Division of Biostatistics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', '12 Centre for Organismal Studies (COS), University of Heidelberg, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', '13 Department of Neuropathology, Institute of Pathology, Heidelberg University Hospital, and Clinical Cooperation Unit Neuropathology, German Consortium for Translational Cancer Research (DKTK), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', '14 Department of Dermatology and National Center for Tumor Diseases, Heidelberg University Hospital, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', '15 Department of Cell Toxicology, Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research-UFZ, 04318 Leipzig, Germany.', '16 Center for Digital Health, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universität Berlin, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin and Berlin Institute of Health (BIH), 10117 Berlin, Germany.', '17 Department of Ecological Chemistry, Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research-UFZ, 04318 Leipzig, Germany.', '18 Jena University Language & Information Engineering (JULIE) Lab, Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena, 07743 Jena, Germany; Systems Biology and Bioinformatics, Leibniz Institute for Natural Product Research and Infection Biology-Hans Knöll Institute, 07745 Jena, Germany.', '19 Institute of Biochemistry and Center for Molecular Biosciences Innsbruck, University of Innsbruck, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria; Department of Pediatrics, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, 9700 RB Groningen, The Netherlands; Department of Neuroscience, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Carl von Ossietzky University Oldenburg, 26129 Oldenburg, Germany.', '20 Molecular Epidemiology Unit, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universität Berlin, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin and Berlin Institute of Health (BIH), 10117 Berlin, Germany.', '21 DKTK Brain Cancer Metabolism Group, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), 69120 Heidelberg, Germany; Neurology Clinic and National Center for Tumor Diseases, Heidelberg University Hospital, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.

1113,3D dynamic MRI of the vocal tract during natural speech,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      To develop and evaluate a technique for 3D dynamic MRI of the full vocal tract at high temporal resolution during natural speech. Methods:
      
    

    
      We demonstrate 2.4 × 2.4 × 5.8 mm3 spatial resolution, 61-ms temporal resolution, and a 200 × 200 × 70 mm3 FOV. The proposed method uses 3D gradient-echo imaging with a custom upper-airway coil, a minimum-phase slab excitation, stack-of-spirals readout, pseudo golden-angle view order in kx -ky , linear Cartesian order along kz , and spatiotemporal finite difference constrained reconstruction, with 13-fold acceleration.

Results:
      
    

    
      This technique captured known dynamics of vocal tract articulators during natural speech tasks including tongue gestures during the production of consonants ""s"" and ""l"" and of consonant-vowel syllables, and was additionally consistent with 2D dynamic MRI. Coordination of lingual (tongue) movements for consonants is demonstrated via volume-of-interest analysis. Vocal tract area function dynamics revealed critical lingual constriction events along the length of the vocal tract for consonants and vowels. Conclusion:

1114,Intraocular Pressure Changes after Cataract Surgery in Patients with and without Glaucoma: An Informatics-Based Approach,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      To evaluate changes in intraocular pressure (IOP) after cataract surgery among patients with or without glaucoma using automated extraction of data from electronic health records (EHRs). Design:
      
    

    
      Retrospective cohort study. Participants:
      
    

    
      Adults who underwent standalone cataract surgery at a single academic center from 2009-2018. Methods:
      
    

    
      Patient information was identified from procedure and billing codes, demographic tables, medication orders, clinical notes, and eye examination fields in the EHR. A previously validated natural language processing pipeline was used to identify laterality of cataract surgery from operative notes and laterality of eye medications from medication orders. Cox proportional hazards modeling evaluated factors associated with the main outcome of sustained postoperative IOP reduction. Main outcome measures:
      
    

    
      Sustained post-cataract surgery IOP reduction, measured at 14 months or the last follow-up while using equal or fewer glaucoma medications compared with baseline and without additional glaucoma laser or surgery on the operative eye. Results:
      
    

    
      The median follow-up for 7574 eyes of 4883 patients who underwent cataract surgery was 244 days. The mean preoperative IOP for all patients was 15.2 mmHg (standard deviation [SD], 3.4 mmHg), which decreased to 14.2 mmHg (SD, 3.0 mmHg) at 12 months after surgery. Patients with IOP of 21.0 mmHg or more showed mean postoperative IOP reduction ranging from -6.2 to -6.9 mmHg. Cataract surgery was more likely to yield sustained IOP reduction for patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (hazard ratio [HR], 1.19; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.36) or narrow angles or angle closure (HR, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.34) compared with patients without glaucoma. Those with a higher baseline IOP were more likely to achieve postoperative IOP reduction (HR, 1.06 per 1-mmHg increase in baseline IOP; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.07). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our results suggest that patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or with narrow angles or chronic angle closure were more likely to achieve sustained IOP reduction after cataract surgery. Patients with higher baseline IOP had increasingly higher odds of achieving reduction in IOP. This evidence demonstrates the potential usefulness of a pipeline for automated extraction of ophthalmic surgical outcomes from EHR to answer key clinical questions on a large scale.","['1 Byers Eye Institute, Stanford University, Palo Alto, California.

1115,Mining social media for prescription medication abuse monitoring: a review and proposal for a data-centric framework,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Prescription medication (PM) misuse and abuse is a major health problem globally, and a number of recent studies have focused on exploring social media as a resource for monitoring nonmedical PM use. Our objectives are to present a methodological review of social media-based PM abuse or misuse monitoring studies, and to propose a potential generalizable, data-centric processing pipeline for the curation of data from this resource. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      We identified studies involving social media, PMs, and misuse or abuse (inclusion criteria) from Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. We categorized studies based on multiple characteristics including but not limited to data size; social media source(s); medications studied; and primary objectives, methods, and findings. Results:
      
    

    
      A total of 39 studies met our inclusion criteria, with 31 (∼79.5%) published since 2015. Twitter has been the most popular resource, with Reddit and Instagram gaining popularity recently. Early studies focused mostly on manual, qualitative analyses, with a growing trend toward the use of data-centric methods involving natural language processing and machine learning. Discussion:
      
    

    
      There is a paucity of standardized, data-centric frameworks for curating social media data for task-specific analyses and near real-time surveillance of nonmedical PM use. Many existing studies do not quantify human agreements for manual annotation tasks or take into account the presence of noise in data. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The development of reproducible and standardized data-centric frameworks that build on the current state-of-the-art methods in data and text mining may enable effective utilization of social media data for understanding and monitoring nonmedical PM use.","['1 Department of Biomedical Informatics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.', '2 College of Arts and Sciences, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', '3 Department of Emergency Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.']","Abeed Sarker, Annika DeRoos, Jeanmarie Perrone, ",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2020,natural language processing; prescription drug misuse; social media; substance abuse detection; text mining.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31584645
1116,Impact of Different Electronic Cohort Definitions to Identify Patients With Atrial Fibrillation From the Electronic Medical Record,"Background Electronic medical records (EMRs) allow identification of disease-specific patient populations, but varying electronic cohort definitions could result in different populations. We compared the characteristics of an electronic medical record-derived atrial fibrillation (AF) patient population using 5 different electronic cohort definitions. Methods and Results Adult patients with at least 1 AF billing code from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2017, were included. Based on different electronic cohort definitions, we trained 5 different logistic regression models using a labeled training data set (n=786). Each model yielded a predicted probability; patients were classified as having AF if the probability was higher than a specified cut point. Test characteristics were calculated for each model. These models were then applied to the full cohort and resulting characteristics were compared. In the training set, the comprehensive model (including demographics, billing codes, and natural language processing results) performed best, with an area under the curve of 0.89, sensitivity of 0.90, and specificity of 0.87. Among a candidate population (n=22 000), the proportion of patients identified as having AF varied from 61% in the model using diagnosis or procedure International Classification of Diseases (ICD) billing codes to 83% in the model using natural language processing of clinical notes. Among identified AF patients, the proportion of patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥2 varied from 69% to 85%; oral anticoagulant treatment rates varied from 50% to 66% depending on the model. Conclusions Different electronic cohort definitions result in substantially different AF study samples. This difference threatens the quality and reproducibility of electronic medical record-based research and quality initiatives.","['1 Division of Cardiovascular Medicine Department of Internal Medicine University of Utah School of Medicine Salt Lake City UT.', '2 Division of Epidemiology Department of Internal Medicine University of Utah School of Medicine Salt Lake City UT.', '3 Department of Population Health University of Utah School of Medicine Salt Lake City UT.', '4 Section\xa0of Cardiology Department of Internal Medicine University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine Chicago IL.', '5 Department of Preventive Medicine Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine Chicago IL.', '6 Centre for Digital Transformation of Health Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre Melbourne Australia.']","Rashmee U Shah, Rebeka Mukherjee, Yue Zhang, Aubrey E Jones, Jennifer Springer, Ian Hackett, Benjamin A Steinberg, Donald M Lloyd-Jones, Wendy W Chapman, ",Journal of the American Heart Association,2020,atrial fibrillation; electronic health records; health services research; informatics; quality of care.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32098599

For typical approaches, they encode image into feature representations and decode it into natural language sentences. While they neglect high-level semantic concepts and subtle relationships between image regions and natural language elements. To make full use of these information, this paper attempt to exploit the text-guided attention and semantic-guided attention (SA) to find the more correlated spatial information and reduce the semantic gap between vision and language. Our method includes two-level attention networks. One is the text-guided attention network which is used to select the text-related regions. The other is SA network which is used to highlight the concept-related regions and the region-related concepts. At last, all these information are incorporated to generate captions or answers. Practically, image captioning and visual question answering experiments have been carried out, and the experimental results have shown the excellent performance of the proposed approach.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Xuelong Li, Aihong Yuan, Xiaoqiang Lu, ",IEEE transactions on cybernetics,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31107679
1118,Homology and Specificity of Natural Sound-Encoding in Human and Monkey Auditory Cortex,"Understanding homologies and differences in auditory cortical processing in human and nonhuman primates is an essential step in elucidating the neurobiology of speech and language. Using fMRI responses to natural sounds, we investigated the representation of multiple acoustic features in auditory cortex of awake macaques and humans. Comparative analyses revealed homologous large-scale topographies not only for frequency but also for temporal and spectral modulations. In both species, posterior regions preferably encoded relatively fast temporal and coarse spectral information, whereas anterior regions encoded slow temporal and fine spectral modulations. Conversely, we observed a striking interspecies difference in cortical sensitivity to temporal modulations: While decoding from macaque auditory cortex was most accurate at fast rates (> 30 Hz), humans had highest sensitivity to ~3 Hz, a relevant rate for speech analysis. These findings suggest that characteristic tuning of human auditory cortex to slow temporal modulations is unique and may have emerged as a critical step in the evolution of speech and language.","['1 Department of Cognitive Neuroscience, Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience, Maastricht University, 6200 MD Maastricht, The Netherlands.', '2 Maastricht Brain Imaging Center (MBIC), MD Maastricht, The Netherlands.', '3 Department of Psychology, University of Lübeck, Lübeck, Germany.', '4 Laboratorium voor Neuro-en Psychofysiologie, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', '5 MGH Martinos Center, Charlestown, MA, USA.', '6 Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', '7 Leuven Brain Institute, Leuven, Belgium.', '8 Maastricht Center for Systems Biology (MaCSBio), MD Maastricht, The Netherlands.']","Julia Erb, Marcelo Armendariz, Federico De Martino, Rainer Goebel, Wim Vanduffel, Elia Formisano, ","Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)",2019,functional MRI; primate auditory cortex; rhesus macaque; spectrotemporal modulations; tonotopy.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30395192
1119,Auditory event-related potentials index faster processing of natural speech but not synthetic speech over nonspeech analogs in children,"Given the crucial role of speech sounds in human language, it may be beneficial for speech to be supported by more efficient auditory and attentional neural processing mechanisms compared to nonspeech sounds. However, previous event-related potential (ERP) studies have found either no differences or slower auditory processing of speech than nonspeech, as well as inconsistent attentional processing. We hypothesized that this may be due to the use of synthetic stimuli in past experiments. The present study measured ERP responses during passive listening to both synthetic and natural speech and complexity-matched nonspeech analog sounds in 22 8-11-year-old children. We found that although children were more likely to show immature auditory ERP responses to the more complex natural stimuli, ERP latencies were significantly faster to natural speech compared to cow vocalizations, but were significantly slower to synthetic speech compared to tones. The attentional results indicated a P3a orienting response only to the cow sound, and we discuss potential methodological reasons for this. We conclude that our results support more efficient auditory processing of natural speech sounds in children, though more research with a wider array of stimuli will be necessary to confirm these results. Our results also highlight the importance of using natural stimuli in research investigating the neurobiology of language.","['1 Department of Hearing and Speech Sciences, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, 1215 21st Ave S., Nashville, TN, USA.

1121,Optimizing genetics online resources for diverse readers,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      Clear and accurate genetic information should be available to health-care consumers at an individualized level of comprehension. The objective of this study is to evaluate the complexity of common online resources and to simplify text content using automated text processing tools. Methods:
      
    

    
      We extracted all text from Genetics Home Reference and MedlinePlus in bulk and analyzed content using natural language processing. We applied custom tools to improve the readability and compared readability before and after text optimization. Results:
      
    

    
      Commonly used educational materials were more complex than the recommended reading level for the general public. Genetic health information entries from Genetics Home Reference (n = 1279) were written at a median 13.0 grade level. MedlinePlus entries, which are not exclusively genetic (n = 1030), had a median grade level of 7.7. When we optimized text for the 59 actionable conditions by prioritizing medical details using a standard structure, the average reading grade level improved. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Factors that increase complexity are long sentences and difficult words. Future strategies to reduce complexity include prioritizing relevant details and using more illustrations. Simplifying and providing standardized online health resources would benefit diverse consumers and promote inclusivity.","['1 Division of Medical Genetics, Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', '2 Institute for Human Genetics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', '3 Division of Medical Genetics, Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. joseph.shieh2@ucsf.edu.', '4 Institute for Human Genetics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. joseph.shieh2@ucsf.edu.']","Jiyoo Chang, Monica Penon-Portmann, Joseph T Shieh, ",Genetics in medicine : official journal of the American College of Medical Genetics,2020 Mar,consumer health informatics; educational resources; genomics; infographics; natural language processing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31767985

This review presents a range of signal sensing and acquisition methods utilized in conjunction with the existing high-tech AAC platforms for individuals with a speech disability, including imaging methods, touch-enabled systems, mechanical and electro-mechanical access, breath-activated methods, and brain-computer interfaces (BCI). The listed AAC sensing modalities are compared in terms of ease of access, affordability, complexity, portability, and typical conversational speeds. A revelation of the associated AAC signal processing, encoding, and retrieval highlights the roles of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) in the development of intelligent AAC solutions. The demands and the affordability of most systems hinder the scale of usage of high-tech AAC. Further research is indeed needed for the development of intelligent AAC applications reducing the associated costs and enhancing the portability of the solutions for a real user's environment. The consolidation of natural language processing with current solutions also needs to be further explored for the amelioration of the conversational speeds. The recommendations for prospective advances in coming high-tech AAC are addressed in terms of developments to support mobile health communicative applications.","['1 Wolfson School of Mechanical, Electrical, and Manufacturing Engineering, Loughborough University, Loughborough LE11 3TU, UK.

The current report illustrates a series of methods using machine learning and receiver operating characteristics (ROCs) to examine whether the language participants use to justify their 'old' and 'new' recognition decisions (viz., memory justifications) predicts accuracy. The findings demonstrate that the natural language of observers conveys the accuracy of 'old' (hits versus false alarms) but not 'new' (misses versus correct rejections) decisions. The classifier trained on this language was considerably more predictive of accuracy than the initial speed of the decisions, generalized to the justification language of two independent experiments using different procedures, and appeared sensitive to the presence versus absence of recollective experiences in the observer's reports. We conclude by considering extensions of the approach to several basic and applied areas, and, more broadly, to identifying the explicit bases (if any) of classification decisions in general.","['1 Washington University in Saint Louis, United States.

1124,The First Vietnamese FOSD-Tacotron-2-based Text-to-Speech Model Dataset,"Recent trends in voicebot application development have enabled utilization of both speech-to-text and text-to-speech (TTS) generation techniques. In order to generate a voice response to a given speech, one needs to use a TTS engine. The recently developed TTS engines are shifting towards end-to-end approaches utilizing models such as Tacotron, Tacotron-2, WaveNet, and WaveGlow. The reason is that it enables a TTS service provider to focus on developing training and validating datasets comprising of labelled texts and recorded speeches instead of designing an entirely new model that outperforms the others which is time-consuming and costly. In this context, this work introduces the first Vietnamese FPT Open Speech Data (FOSD)-Tacotron-2-based TTS model dataset. This dataset comprises of a configuration file in *.json format; training and validating text input files (in *.csv format); a 225,000-step checkpoint of the trained model; and several sample generated audios. The published dataset is extremely worth for serving as a model for benchmarking with other newly developed TTS models / engines. In addition, it opens an entirely new TTS research optimization problem to be addressed: How to effectively generate speech from text given: a black box TTS (trained) model and its training and validation input texts.","['1 Computing Fundamental Department - FPT University, Hoa Lac Hi-Tech Park, Hanoi, Vietnam, 155300.']","Duc Chung Tran, ",Data in brief,2020,Dataset; Natural language generation; Natural language processing; Speech; Tacotron; Text-to-speech; Vietnamese; WaveNet.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32551347
1125,Effect of Speech Recognition on Problem Solving and Recall in Consumer Digital Health Tasks: Controlled Laboratory Experiment,"Background:
      
    

    
      Recent advances in natural language processing and artificial intelligence have led to widespread adoption of speech recognition technologies. In consumer health applications, speech recognition is usually applied to support interactions with conversational agents for data collection, decision support, and patient monitoring. However, little is known about the use of speech recognition in consumer health applications and few studies have evaluated the efficacy of conversational agents in the hands of consumers. In other consumer-facing tools, cognitive load has been observed to be an important factor affecting the use of speech recognition technologies in tasks involving problem solving and recall. Users find it more difficult to think and speak at the same time when compared to typing, pointing, and clicking. However, the effects of speech recognition on cognitive load when performing health tasks has not yet been explored. Objective:
      
    

    
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of speech recognition for documentation in consumer digital health tasks involving problem solving and recall. Methods:
      
    

    
      Fifty university staff and students were recruited to undertake four documentation tasks with a simulated conversational agent in a computer laboratory. The tasks varied in complexity determined by the amount of problem solving and recall required (simple and complex) and the input modality (speech recognition vs keyboard and mouse). Cognitive load, task completion time, error rate, and usability were measured. Results:
      
    

    
      Compared to using a keyboard and mouse, speech recognition significantly increased the cognitive load for complex tasks (Z=-4.08, P<.001) and simple tasks (Z=-2.24, P=.03). Complex tasks took significantly longer to complete (Z=-2.52, P=.01) and speech recognition was found to be overall less usable than a keyboard and mouse (Z=-3.30, P=.001). However, there was no effect on errors. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Use of a keyboard and mouse was preferable to speech recognition for complex tasks involving problem solving and recall. Further studies using a broader variety of consumer digital health tasks of varying complexity are needed to investigate the contexts in which use of speech recognition is most appropriate. The effects of cognitive load on task performance and its significance also need to be investigated.","['1 Centre for Health Informatics, Australian Institute of Health Innovation, Macquarie University, North Ryde, Australia.']","Jessica Chen, David Lyell, Liliana Laranjo, Farah Magrabi, ",Journal of medical Internet research,2020,consumer health informatics; ergonomics; speech recognition software.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32442129
1126,Identifying Acute Low Back Pain Episodes in Primary Care Practice From Clinical Notes: Observational Study,"Background:
      
    

    
      Acute and chronic low back pain (LBP) are different conditions with different treatments. However, they are coded in electronic health records with the same International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) code (M54.5) and can be differentiated only by retrospective chart reviews. This prevents an efficient definition of data-driven guidelines for billing and therapy recommendations, such as return-to-work options. Objective:
      
    

    
      The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of automatically distinguishing acute LBP episodes by analyzing free-text clinical notes. Methods:
      
    

    
      We used a dataset of 17,409 clinical notes from different primary care practices; of these, 891 documents were manually annotated as acute LBP and 2973 were generally associated with LBP via the recorded ICD-10 code. We compared different supervised and unsupervised strategies for automated identification: keyword search, topic modeling, logistic regression with bag of n-grams and manual features, and deep learning (a convolutional neural network-based architecture [ConvNet]). We trained the supervised models using either manual annotations or ICD-10 codes as positive labels. Results:
      
    

    
      ConvNet trained using manual annotations obtained the best results with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.98 and an F score of 0.70. ConvNet's results were also robust to reduction of the number of manually annotated documents. In the absence of manual annotations, topic models performed better than methods trained using ICD-10 codes, which were unsatisfactory for identifying LBP acuity. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      This study uses clinical notes to delineate a potential path toward systematic learning of therapeutic strategies, billing guidelines, and management options for acute LBP at the point of care.","['1 Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, United States.', '2 Institute for Next Generation Healthcare, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, United States.', '3 Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, United States.', '4 Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, United States.', '5 Department of Environmental Medicine and Public Health, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, United States.']","Riccardo Miotto, Bethany L Percha, Benjamin S Glicksberg, Hao-Chih Lee, Lisanne Cruz, Joel T Dudley, Ismail Nabeel, ",JMIR medical informatics,2020,clinical notes; electronic health records; low back pain; machine learning; natural language processing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32130159

1128,"Pregnancy and health in the age of the Internet: A content analysis of online ""birth club"" forums","Background:
      
    

    
      Although studies report that more than 90% of pregnant women utilize digital sources to supplement their maternal healthcare, little is known about the kinds of information that women seek from their peers during pregnancy. To date, most research has used self-report measures to elucidate how and why women to turn to digital sources during pregnancy. However, given that these measures may differ from actual utilization of online health information, it is important to analyze the online content pregnant women generate. Objective:
      
    

    
      To apply machine learning methods to analyze online pregnancy forums, to better understand how women seek information from a community of online peers during pregnancy. Methods:
      
    

    
      Data from seven WhatToExpect.com ""birth club"" forums (September 2018; January-June 2018) were scraped. Forum posts were collected for a one-year period, which included three trimesters and three months postpartum. Only initial posts from each thread were analyzed (n = 262,238). Automatic natural language processing (NLP) methods captured 50 discussed topics, which were annotated by two independent coders and grouped categorically. Results:
      
    

    
      The largest topic categories were maternal health (45%), baby-related topics (29%), and people/relationships (10%). While pain was a popular topic all throughout pregnancy, individual topics that were dominant by trimester included miscarriage (first trimester), labor (third trimester), and baby sleeping routine (postpartum period). Conclusion:
      
    

    
      More than just emotional or peer support, pregnant women turn to online forums to discuss their health. Dominant topics, such as labor and miscarriage, suggest unmet informational needs in these domains. With misinformation becoming a growing public health concern, more attention must be directed toward peer-exchange outlets.","['1 Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States of America.', '2 Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States of America.', '3 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States of America.']","Anna Wexler, Anahita Davoudi, Davy Weissenbacher, Rebekah Choi, Karen O'Connor, Holly Cummings, Graciela Gonzalez-Hernandez, ",PloS one,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32287266
1129,Quasi-compositional mapping from form to meaning: a neural network-based approach to capturing neural responses during human language comprehension,"We argue that natural language can be usefully described as quasi-compositional and we suggest that deep learning-based neural language models bear long-term promise to capture how language conveys meaning. We also note that a successful account of human language processing should explain both the outcome of the comprehension process and the continuous internal processes underlying this performance. These points motivate our discussion of a neural network model of sentence comprehension, the Sentence Gestalt model, which we have used to account for the N400 component of the event-related brain potential (ERP), which tracks meaning processing as it happens in real time. The model, which shares features with recent deep learning-based language models, simulates N400 amplitude as the automatic update of a probabilistic representation of the situation or event described by the sentence, corresponding to a temporal difference learning signal at the level of meaning. We suggest that this process happens relatively automatically, and that sometimes a more-controlled attention-dependent process is necessary for successful comprehension, which may be reflected in the subsequent P600 ERP component. We relate this account to current deep learning models as well as classic linguistic theory, and use it to illustrate a domain general perspective on some specific linguistic operations postulated based on compositional analyses of natural language. This article is part of the theme issue 'Towards mechanistic models of meaning composition'.","['1 Department of Psychology, University of Potsdam, Karl-Liebknecht-Strasse 24-25, 14476 Potsdam, Germany.', '2 Department of Psychology, Stanford University, 450 Jane Stanford Way, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.']","Milena Rabovsky, James L McClelland, ","Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

1130,Tracking the implicit acquisition of nonadjacent transitional probabilities by ERPs,"The implicit acquisition of complex probabilistic regularities has been found to be crucial in numerous automatized cognitive abilities, including language processing and associative learning. However, it has not been completely elucidated how the implicit extraction of second-order nonadjacent transitional probabilities is reflected by neurophysiological processes. Therefore, this study investigated the sensitivity of event-related brain potentials (ERPs) to these probabilistic regularities embedded in a sequence of visual stimuli without providing explicit information on the structure of the stimulus stream. Healthy young adults (N = 32) performed a four-choice RT task that included a sequential regularity between nonadjacent trials yielding a complex transitional probability structure. ERPs were measured relative to both stimulus and response onset. RTs indicated the rapid acquisition of the sequential regularity and the transitional probabilities. The acquisition process was also tracked by the stimulus-locked and response-locked P3 component: The P3 peak was larger for the sequence than for the random stimuli, while the late P3 was larger for less probable than for more probable short-range relations among the random stimuli. According to the RT and P3 effects, sensitivity to the sequential regularity is assumed to be supported by the initial sensitivity to the transitional probabilities. These results suggest that stimulus-response contingencies on the probabilistic regularities of the ongoing stimulus context are implicitly mapped and constantly revised. Overall, this study (1) highlights the role of predictive processes during implicit memory formation, and (2) delineates a potential to gain further insight into the dynamics of implicit acquisition processes.","['1 Brain Imaging Centre, Research Centre for Natural Sciences, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Magyar tudósok körútja 2, Budapest, H-1117, Hungary. kobor.andrea@ttk.mta.hu.', '2 Doctoral School of Psychology, ELTE Eötvös Loránd University, Izabella utca 46, Budapest, H-1064, Hungary.', '3 Institute of Psychology, ELTE Eötvös Loránd University, Izabella utca 46, Budapest, H-1064, Hungary.', '4 Brain, Memory and Language Research Group, Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience and Psychology, Research Centre for Natural Sciences, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Magyar tudósok körútja 2, Budapest, H-1117, Hungary.', '5 Brain Imaging Centre, Research Centre for Natural Sciences, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Magyar tudósok körútja 2, Budapest, H-1117, Hungary.', '6 Department of Cognitive Science, Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Egry József utca 1, Budapest, H-1111, Hungary.', '7 Lyon Neuroscience Research Center (CRNL), INSERM, CNRS, Université de Lyon, Centre Hospitalier Le Vinatier-Bâtiment 462-Neurocampus 95 Boulevard Pinel, 69675, Bron, Lyon, France.']","Andrea Kóbor, Kata Horváth, Zsófia Kardos, Ádám Takács, Karolina Janacsek, Valéria Csépe, Dezso Nemeth, ",Memory & cognition,2019 Nov,Implicit learning; Nonadjacent dependencies; P3; Predictive processes; Stimulus–response mapping.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31236822

In the current study, we combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) methodology to investigate the neural basis of semantic cognition in Mandarin Chinese. In the fMRI experiment, strong activations were observed in left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and left middle temporal gyrus (MTG) for semantic judgment task. Moreover, functional connectivity was found from seed region left IFG to left MTG. Meanwhile, negative correlation between performance and extracted parameter estimates from left IFG to left MTG was detected in semantic task. Subsequent TMS stimulation over left IFG resulted in performance deficits in semantic judgment task, in contrast to other three sites: left MTG, right intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and a control site.

1132,Interhemispheric transfer of semantic information facilitates bilateral word recognition,"Language comprehension is left-lateralized but with variable contributions from the right hemisphere. When both hemispheres are stimulated simultaneously using divided visual field presentation, performance may be enhanced or hindered depending on the complexity of the task, and these effects may relate to independent processing in both hemispheres or to information transfer between hemispheres. Simultaneous stimulation of both hemispheres is thought to suppress interhemispheric interactions, but information transfer may nonetheless occur. Studies with simultaneous bilateral displays have demonstrated that semantic information from the contralateral visual field (and hemisphere) can facilitate relatedness judgments and lexical decisions. The current study extends this line of research by assessing semantic information transfer in a bilateral word identification task. Task manipulations involving directed spatial attention and asymmetric primes (e.g., ATOM → BOMB) were used to isolate automatic priming as opposed to top-down processing. The results revealed 2 main findings: (a) interhemispheric priming in the form of improved word recognition occurred specifically in conditions designed to isolate automatic transfer of semantic information, that is, in the attended visual field for the target word in asymmetric prime pairs, and (b) there is evidence for an asymmetrical transfer of semantic information, in that the subordinate left visual field-right hemisphere benefited more from such transfer. Together, these results demonstrate evidence for automatic interhemispheric transfer of semantic information, even under conditions of simultaneous bilateral display.

      The interactions between non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) and proteins play an essential role in many biological processes. Several high-throughput experimental methods have been applied to detect ncRNA-protein interactions. However, these methods are time-consuming and expensive. Accurate and efficient computational methods can assist and accelerate the study of ncRNA-protein interactions. Results:
      
    

    
      In this work, we develop a stacking ensemble computational framework, RPI-SE, for effectively predicting ncRNA-protein interactions.

Meanwhile, k-mer sparse matrix is employed to extract efficient feature of ncRNA sequences. Finally, an ensemble learning framework integrated different types of base classifier is developed to predict ncRNA-protein interactions using these discriminative features. The accuracy and robustness of RPI-SE was evaluated on three benchmark data sets under five-fold cross-validation and compared with other state-of-the-art methods. Conclusions:

With healthcare robots provoking influential physical composition and sensory expressions, the relations in human-healthcare robot transactive engagements are argued as supportive of the design and development in natural language processing. This implies that maintaining human-healthcare robot interaction and assessing the eeriness situations explained in the Uncanny Valley theory are crucial positions for healthcare robot functioning as a valuable commodity in health care. As such, physical features, language capabilities and mobility of healthcare robots establish the primacy of the AAC with natural language processing as integral to healthcare robot-human healthcare practice.","['1 Graduate School of Health Sciences, Tokushima University Graduate School, Tokushima, Japan.', '2 Kochi University Graduate School of Integrated and Sciences, Kochi, Japan.', '3 Tokushima University Graduate School of Technology, Industrial and Social Sciences, Tokushima, Japan.', '4 Tokushima University Graduate School, Tokushima, Japan.', '5 Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Tokushima University Graduate School Tokushima, Tokushima, Japan.', '6 Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, FL, USA.']","Feni Betriana, Kyoko Osaka, Kazuyuki Matsumoto, Tetsuya Tanioka, Rozzano C Locsin, ",Nursing philosophy : an international journal for healthcare professionals,2020,Masahiro Mori; Uncanny Valley; artificial affective communication; healthcare robots; natural language processing; nursing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32803785
1136,Time event ontology (TEO): to support semantic representation and reasoning of complex temporal relations of clinical events,"Objective:
      
    

    
      The goal of this study is to develop a robust Time Event Ontology (TEO), which can formally represent and reason both structured and unstructured temporal information. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      Using our previous Clinical Narrative Temporal Relation Ontology 1.0 and 2.0 as a starting point, we redesigned concept primitives (clinical events and temporal expressions) and enriched temporal relations. Specifically, 2 sets of temporal relations (Allen's interval algebra and a novel suite of basic time relations) were used to specify qualitative temporal order relations, and a Temporal Relation Statement was designed to formalize quantitative temporal relations. Moreover, a variety of data properties were defined to represent diversified temporal expressions in clinical narratives. Results:
      
    

    
      TEO has a rich set of classes and properties (object, data, and annotation). When evaluated with real electronic health record data from the Mayo Clinic, it could faithfully represent more than 95% of the temporal expressions. Its reasoning ability was further demonstrated on a sample drug adverse event report annotated with respect to TEO. The results showed that our Java-based TEO reasoner could answer a set of frequently asked time-related queries, demonstrating that TEO has a strong capability of reasoning complex temporal relations. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      TEO can support flexible temporal relation representation and reasoning. Our next step will be to apply TEO to the natural language processing field to facilitate automated temporal information annotation, extraction, and timeline reasoning to better support time-based clinical decision-making.","['1 School of Biomedical Informatics, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, Texas, USA.', '2 Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', '3 Advanced Analytics, Cummins Inc, Columbus, Indiana, USA.', '4 College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China.', '5 University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', '6 Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.']","Fang Li, Jingcheng Du, Yongqun He, Hsing-Yi Song, Mohcine Madkour, Guozheng Rao, Yang Xiang, Yi Luo, Henry W Chen, Sijia Liu, Liwei Wang, Hongfang Liu, Hua Xu, Cui Tao, ",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2020,Allen’s interval algebra; basic time relations; clinical decision support; clinical event; temporal relational reasoning; time event ontology.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32626903

1138,Deficits in the Palliative Care Process Measures in Patients with Advanced Pancreatic Cancer Undergoing Operative and Invasive Nonoperative Palliative Procedures,"Background:
      
    

    
      Given survival measured in months, metrics, such as 30-day mortality, are poorly suited to measure the quality of palliative procedures for patients with advanced cancer. Nationally endorsed process measures associated with high-quality PC include code-status clarification, goals-of-care discussions, palliative-care referral, and hospice assessment. The impact of the performance of these process measures on subsequent healthcare utilization is unknown. Methods:
      
    

    
      Administrative data and manual review were used to identify hospital admissions with performance of palliative procedures for advanced pancreatic cancer at two tertiary care hospitals from 2011 to 2016. Natural language processing, a form of computer-assisted abstraction, identified process measures in associated free-text notes. Healthcare utilization was compared using a Cox proportional hazard model. Results:
      
    

    
      We identified 823 hospital admissions with performance of a palliative procedure. PC process measures were identified in 68% of admissions. Patients with documented process measures were older (66 vs. 63; p = 0.04) and had a longer length of stay (9 vs. 6 days; p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, patients treated by surgeons were less likely to have PC process measures performed (odds ratio 0.19; 95% confidence interval 0.10-0.37). Performance of PC process measures was associated with decreased healthcare utilization in a Cox proportional hazard model. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      PC process measures were not performed in almost one-third of hospital admissions for palliative procedures in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Performance of established high-quality process measures for seriously ill patients undergoing palliative procedures may help patients to avoid burdensome, high-intensity care at the end-of-life.","['1 Department of Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA. budelsman@partners.org.', ""2 Center for Surgery and Public Health, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", ""3 Department of Surgery, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", '4 Department of Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.', '5 Department of Psychosocial Oncology and Palliative Care, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', ""6 Division of Palliative Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.""]","Brooks V Udelsman, Elizabeth J Lilley, Motaz Qadan, David C Chang, Keith D Lillemoe, Charlotta Lindvall, Zara Cooper, ",Annals of surgical oncology,2019 Dec,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31463695
1139,Using a Large Margin Context-Aware Convolutional Neural Network to Automatically Extract Disease-Disease Association from Literature: Comparative Analytic Study,"Background:
      
    

    
      Research on disease-disease association (DDA), like comorbidity and complication, provides important insights into disease treatment and drug discovery, and a large body of the literature has been published in the field. However, using current search tools, it is not easy for researchers to retrieve information on the latest DDA findings. First, comorbidity and complication keywords pull up large numbers of PubMed studies. Second, disease is not highlighted in search results. Finally, DDA is not identified, as currently no disease-disease association extraction (DDAE) dataset or tools are available. Objective:
      
    

    
      As there are no available DDAE datasets or tools, this study aimed to develop (1) a DDAE dataset and (2) a neural network model for extracting DDA from the literature. Methods:
      
    

    
      In this study, we formulated DDAE as a supervised machine learning classification problem. To develop the system, we first built a DDAE dataset. We then employed two machine learning models, support vector machine and convolutional neural network, to extract DDA. Furthermore, we evaluated the effect of using the output layer as features of the support vector machine-based model. Finally, we implemented large margin context-aware convolutional neural network architecture to integrate context features and convolutional neural networks through the large margin function. Results:
      
    

    
      Our DDAE dataset consisted of 521 PubMed abstracts. Experiment results showed that the support vector machine-based approach achieved an F1 measure of 80.32%, which is higher than the convolutional neural network-based approach (73.32%). Using the output layer of convolutional neural network as a feature for the support vector machine does not further improve the performance of support vector machine. However, our large margin context-aware-convolutional neural network achieved the highest F1 measure of 84.18% and demonstrated that combining the hinge loss function of support vector machine with a convolutional neural network into a single neural network architecture outperforms other approaches. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      To facilitate the development of text-mining research for DDAE, we developed the first publicly available DDAE dataset consisting of disease mentions, Medical Subject Heading IDs, and relation annotations. We developed different conventional machine learning models and neural network architectures and evaluated their effects on our DDAE dataset. To further improve DDAE performance, we propose an large margin context-aware-convolutional neural network model for DDAE that outperforms other approaches.","['1 Department of Computer Science National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Province of China Taiwan.', '2 Department of Computer Science & Information Engineering, National Central University, Taoyuan, Province of China Taiwan.', '3 Department of Bioinformatics and Medical Engineering, Asia University, Taichung, Province of China Taiwan.']","Po-Ting Lai, Wei-Liang Lu, Ting-Rung Kuo, Chia-Ru Chung, Jen-Chieh Han, Richard Tzong-Han Tsai, Jorng-Tzong Horng, ",JMIR medical informatics,2019,biological relation extraction; biomedical natural language processing; convolutional neural networks; deep learning; disease-disease association.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31769759
1140,Epidemiology of Asthma in Children and Adults,"Asthma is a globally significant non-communicable disease with major public health consequences for both children and adults, including high morbidity, and mortality in severe cases. We have summarized the evidence on asthma trends, environmental determinants, and long-term impacts while comparing these epidemiological features across childhood asthma and adult asthma. While asthma incidence and prevalence are higher in children, morbidity, and mortality are higher in adults. Childhood asthma is more common in boys while adult asthma is more common in women, and the reversal of this sex difference in prevalence occurs around puberty suggesting sex hormones may play a role in the etiology of asthma. The global epidemic of asthma that has been observed in both children and adults is still continuing, especially in low to middle income countries, although it has subsided in some developed countries. As a heterogeneous disease, distinct asthma phenotypes, and endotypes need to be adequately characterized to develop more accurate and meaningful definitions for use in research and clinical settings. This may be facilitated by new clustering techniques such as latent class analysis, and computational phenotyping methods are being developed to retrieve information from electronic health records using natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to assist in the early diagnosis of asthma. While some important environmental determinants that trigger asthma are well-established, more work is needed to define the role of environmental exposures in the development of asthma in both children and adults. There is increasing evidence that investigation into possible gene-by-environment and environment-by-environment interactions may help to better uncover the determinants of asthma. Therefore, there is an urgent need to further investigate the interrelationship between environmental and genetic determinants to identify high risk groups and key modifiable exposures. For children, asthma may impair airway development and reduce maximally attained lung function, and these lung function deficits may persist into adulthood without additional progressive loss. Adult asthma may accelerate lung function decline and increase the risk of fixed airflow obstruction, with the effect of early onset asthma being greater than late onset asthma. Therefore, in managing asthma, our focus going forward should be firmly on improving not only short-term symptoms, but also the long-term respiratory and other health outcomes.","['1 Allergy and Lung Health Unit, School of Population and Global Health, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', '2 Institute for Breathing and Sleep, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', '3 Department of Paediatrics, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.']","Shyamali C Dharmage, Jennifer L Perret, Adnan Custovic, ",Frontiers in pediatrics,2019,asthma epidemiology; incidence; lifecourse; prevalence; risk factors.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31275909
1141,Guessing Meaning From Word Sounds of Unfamiliar Languages: A Cross-Cultural Sound Symbolism Study,"Sound symbolism refers to a non-arbitrary relationship between the sound of a word and its meaning. With the aim to better investigate this relationship by using natural languages, in the present cross-linguistic study 215 Italian and Polish participants were asked to listen to words pronounced in 4 unknown non-indo-European languages (Finnish, Japanese, Swahili, Tamil) and to try to guess the correct meaning of each word, by choosing among 3 alternatives visualized on a computer screen. The alternatives were presented in the mother tongue of participants. Three different word categories were presented: nouns, verbs and adjectives. A first overall analysis confirmed a semantic role of sound symbols, the performance of participants being higher than expected by chance. When analyzed separately for each language and for each word category, the results were significant for Finnish and Japanese, whereas the recognition rate was not significantly better than chance for Swahili and Tamil. Results were significant for nouns and verbs, but not for adjectives. We confirm the existence of sound symbolic processing in natural unknown languages, and we speculate that some possible difference in the iconicity of the languages could be the basis for the difference we found. Importantly, the evidence that there were no differences between Italian and Polish participants allows us to conclude that the sound symbolism is independent of the mother tongue of the listener.","[""1 Department of Psychological, Health and Territorial Sciences, 'G. d'Annunzio' University of Chieti-Pescara, Chieti, Italy."", '2 Institute of Psychology, University of Opole, Opole, Poland.']","Anita D'Anselmo, Giulia Prete, Przemysław Zdybek, Luca Tommasi, Alfredo Brancucci, ",Frontiers in psychology,2019,cross-linguistic; iconicity; natural languages; psycholinguistic; sound symbolism.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30941080
1142,A k-mer grammar analysis to uncover maize regulatory architecture,"Background:
      
    

    
      Only a small percentage of the genome sequence is involved in regulation of gene expression, but to biochemically identify this portion is expensive and laborious. In species like maize, with diverse intergenic regions and lots of repetitive elements, this is an especially challenging problem that limits the use of the data from one line to the other. While regulatory regions are rare, they do have characteristic chromatin contexts and sequence organization (the grammar) with which they can be identified. Results:
      
    

    
      We developed a computational framework to exploit this sequence arrangement. The models learn to classify regulatory regions based on sequence features - k-mers. To do this, we borrowed two approaches from the field of natural language processing: (1) ""bag-of-words"" which is commonly used for differentially weighting key words in tasks like sentiment analyses, and (2) a vector-space model using word2vec (vector-k-mers), that captures semantic and linguistic relationships between words. We built ""bag-of-k-mers"" and ""vector-k-mers"" models that distinguish between regulatory and non-regulatory regions with an average accuracy above 90%. Our ""bag-of-k-mers"" achieved higher overall accuracy, while the ""vector-k-mers"" models were more useful in highlighting key groups of sequences within the regulatory regions. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      These models now provide powerful tools to annotate regulatory regions in other maize lines beyond the reference, at low cost and with high accuracy.","['1 Institute for Genomic Diversity, Cornell University, 175 Biotechnology Building, Ithaca, 14853, NY, USA. mm2842@cornell.edu.', '2 Institute for Genomic Diversity, Cornell University, 175 Biotechnology Building, Ithaca, 14853, NY, USA.', '3 USDA-ARS, Research Geneticist, USDA ARS Robert Holley Center, Ithaca, 14853, NY, USA.', '4 Department of Plant Breeding and Genetics, Cornell University, 159 Biotechnology Building, Ithaca, 14853, NY, USA.']","María Katherine Mejía-Guerra, Edward S Buckler, ",BMC plant biology,2019,Crops genomics; Gene regulatory regions; Machine learning models.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30876396

Initially developed for computer vision and natural language processing, these models have been shown to effectively summarize the complexity that underlies many types of data and enable a range of applications including supervised learning tasks, such as assigning labels to images; unsupervised learning tasks, such as dimensionality reduction; and out-of-sample generation, such as de novo image synthesis. With this early success, the power of generative models is now being increasingly leveraged in molecular biology, with applications ranging from designing new molecules with properties of interest to identifying deleterious mutations in our genomes and to dissecting transcriptional variability between single cells. In this review, we provide a brief overview of the technical notions behind generative models and their implementation with deep learning techniques. We then describe several different ways in which these models can be utilized in practice, using several recent applications in molecular biology as examples.","['1 Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.', '2 Center for Computational Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.', '3 Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.', '4 Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.']","Romain Lopez, Adam Gayoso, Nir Yosef, ",Molecular systems biology,2020 Sep,deep generative models; molecular biology; neural networks.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32975352

It plays an essential role in numerous applications in information retrieval (IR) and natural language processing (NLP). In this paper, we introduce a novel Knowledge-enhanced Hierarchical Attention mechanism for Answer Selection (KHAAS), which fully exploits the common sense knowledge from knowledge bases (KBs) and input textual information. Specifically, we first devise a three-stage knowledge-enhanced hierarchical attention mechanism, including the word-level attention, the phrase-level attention, and the document-level attention to learn the fact-aware intra-document features within questions and answers by fusing the knowledge from both the question/answer and KB. Hence, we can leverage the semantic compositionality of the question/answer and learn more holistic knowledge-enhanced intra-document features of the question/answer at three levels of granularity. Second, after obtaining the knowledge-enhanced question and answer representations, we employ a multi-perspective co-attention network to learn the complex inter-document relationships between the question and answer representations from different representation subspaces, which can capture the interactive semantics of the question and answer representations at three levels. Finally, we propose an adaptive decision fusion method to learn a more effective and robust ensemble answer selection model by adaptively combining multiple classifiers learned with different levels of features. Experimental results on three large-scale answer selection datasets demonstrate that KHAAS consistently outperforms the compared methods.","['1 Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China.

1145,Chemical-protein interaction extraction via contextualized word representations and multihead attention,"A rich source of chemical-protein interactions (CPIs) is locked in the exponentially growing biomedical literature. Automatic extraction of CPIs is a crucial task in biomedical natural language processing (NLP), which has great benefits for pharmacological and clinical research. Deep context representation and multihead attention are recent developments in deep learning and have shown their potential in some NLP tasks. Unlike traditional word embedding, deep context representation has the ability to generate comprehensive sentence representation based on the sentence context. The multihead attention mechanism can effectively learn the important features from different heads and emphasize the relatively important features. Integrating deep context representation and multihead attention with a neural network-based model may improve CPI extraction. We present a deep neural model for CPI extraction based on deep context representation and multihead attention. Our model mainly consists of the following three parts: a deep context representation layer, a bidirectional long short-term memory networks (Bi-LSTMs) layer and a multihead attention layer. The deep context representation is employed to provide more comprehensive feature input for Bi-LSTMs. The multihead attention can effectively emphasize the important part of the Bi-LSTMs output. We evaluated our method on the public ChemProt corpus. These experimental results show that both deep context representation and multihead attention are helpful in CPI extraction. Our method can compete with other state-of-the-art methods on ChemProt corpus.","['1 College of Computer Science and Technology, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China.']","Yijia Zhang, Hongfei Lin, Zhihao Yang, Jian Wang, Yuanyuan Sun, ",Database : the journal of biological databases and curation,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31125403
1146,LSTMVoter: chemical named entity recognition using a conglomerate of sequence labeling tools,"Background:
      
    

    
      Chemical and biomedical named entity recognition (NER) is an essential preprocessing task in natural language processing. The identification and extraction of named entities from scientific articles is also attracting increasing interest in many scientific disciplines. Locating chemical named entities in the literature is an essential step in chemical text mining pipelines for identifying chemical mentions, their properties, and relations as discussed in the literature. In this work, we describe an approach to the BioCreative V.5 challenge regarding the recognition and classification of chemical named entities. For this purpose, we transform the task of NER into a sequence labeling problem. We present a series of sequence labeling systems that we used, adapted and optimized in our experiments for solving this task. To this end, we experiment with hyperparameter optimization. Finally, we present LSTMVoter, a two-stage application of recurrent neural networks that integrates the optimized sequence labelers from our study into a single ensemble classifier.

1148,Using 311 data to develop an algorithm to identify urban blight for public health improvement,"The growth of administrative data made available publicly, often in near-real time, offers new opportunities for monitoring conditions that impact community health. Urban blight-manifestations of adverse social processes in the urban environment, including physical disorder, decay, and loss of anchor institutions-comprises many conditions considered to negatively affect the health of communities. However, measurement strategies for urban blight have been complicated by lack of uniform data, often requiring expensive street audits or the use of proxy measures that cannot represent the multifaceted nature of blight. This paper evaluates how publicly available data from New York City's 311-call system can be used in a natural language processing approach to represent urban blight across the city with greater geographic and temporal precision. We found that our urban blight algorithm, which includes counts of keywords ('tokens'), resulted in sensitivity ~90% and specificity between 55% and 76%, depending on other covariates in the model. The percent of 311 calls that were 'blight related' at the census tract level were correlated with the most common proxy measure for blight: short, medium, and long-term vacancy rates for commercial and residential buildings. We found the strongest association with long-term (>1 year) commercial vacancies (Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.16, p < 0.001). Our findings indicate the need of further validation, as well as testing algorithms that disambiguate the different facets of urban blight. These facets include physical disorder (e.g., litter, overgrown lawns, or graffiti) and decay (e.g., vacant or abandoned lots or sidewalks in disrepair) that are manifestations of social processes such as (loss of) neighborhood cohesion, social control, collective efficacy, and anchor institutions. More refined measures of urban blight would allow for better targeted remediation efforts and improved community health.","['1 New York State Health Foundation, New York, New York, United States of America.', '2 Harvard College, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.']","Jessica Athens, Setu Mehta, Sophie Wheelock, Nupur Chaudhury, Mark Zezza, ",PloS one,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32645013
1149,On the Construction of Multilingual Corpora for Clinical Text Mining,"The amount of digital data derived from healthcare processes have increased tremendously in the last years. This applies especially to unstructured data, which are often hard to analyze due to the lack of available tools to process and extract information. Natural language processing is often used in medicine, but the majority of tools used by researchers are developed primarily for the English language. For developing and testing natural language processing methods, it is important to have a suitable corpus, specific to the medical domain that covers the intended target language. To improve the potential of natural language processing research, we developed tools to derive language specific medical corpora from publicly available text sources. n order to extract medicine-specific unstructured text data, openly available pub-lications from biomedical journals were used in a four-step process: (1) medical journal databases were scraped to download the articles, (2) the articles were parsed and consolidated into a single repository, (3) the content of the repository was de-scribed, and (4) the text data and the codes were released. In total, 93 969 articles were retrieved, with a word count of 83 868 501 in three different languages (German, English, and Spanish) from two medical journal databases Our results show that unstructured text data extraction from openly available medical journal databases for the construction of unified corpora of medical text data can be achieved through web scraping techniques.","['1 Institute of Medical Biometry and Informatics, Heidelberg University, Germany.', '2 Center of Medical Informatics and Telemedicine, University of Chile, Chile.', '3 Center for Mathematical Modeling, University of Chile, Chile.']","Fabián Villena, Urs Eisenmann, Petra Knaup, Jocelyn Dunstan, Matthias Ganzinger, ",Studies in health technology and informatics,2020,Data Mining; Information Storage and Retrieval; Linguistics; Medical Informatics; Natural Language Processing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32570404
1150,Benefits of Beamforming With Local Spatial-Cue Preservation for Speech Localization and Segregation,"A study was conducted to examine the benefits afforded by a signal-processing strategy that imposes the binaural cues present in a natural signal, calculated locally in time and frequency, on the output of a beamforming microphone array. Such a strategy has the potential to combine the signal-to-noise ratio advantage of beamforming with the perceptual benefit of spatialization to enhance performance in multitalker mixtures. Participants with normal hearing and with hearing loss were tested on both speech localization and speech-on-speech masking tasks. Performance for the spatialized beamformer was compared with that for three other conditions: a reference condition with no processing, a beamformer with no spatialization, and a hybrid beamformer that operates only in the high frequencies to preserve natural binaural cues in the low frequencies. Beamforming with full-bandwidth spatialization supported speech localization and produced better speech reception thresholds than the other conditions.","['1 Department of Biomedical Engineering, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA.', '2 Department of Speech, Language and Hearing Sciences, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA.', '3 Neuroscience Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.']","Le Wang, Virginia Best, Barbara G Shinn-Cunningham, ",Trends in hearing,Jan-Dec 2020,binaural hearing; cocktail party; hearing aids; hearing loss.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31931677
1151,Distributed representation and one-hot representation fusion with gated network for clinical semantic textual similarity,"Background:
      
    

    
      Semantic textual similarity (STS) is a fundamental natural language processing (NLP) task which can be widely used in many NLP applications such as Question Answer (QA), Information Retrieval (IR), etc. It is a typical regression problem, and almost all STS systems either use distributed representation or one-hot representation to model sentence pairs. Methods:
      
    

    
      In this paper, we proposed a novel framework based on a gated network to fuse distributed representation and one-hot representation of sentence pairs. Some current state-of-the-art distributed representation methods, including Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Bi-directional Long Short Term Memory networks (Bi-LSTM) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), were used in our framework, and a system based on this framework was developed for a shared task regarding clinical STS organized by BioCreative/OHNLP in 2018. Results:
      
    

    
      Compared with the systems only using distributed representation or one-hot representation, our method achieved much higher Pearson correlation. Among all distributed representations, BERT performed best. The highest Person correlation of our system was 0.8541, higher than the best official one of the BioCreative/OHNLP clinical STS shared task in 2018 (0.8328) by 0.0213. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Distributed representation and one-hot representation are complementary to each other and can be fused by gated network.","['1 Department of Computer Science, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China.', '2 Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China.', '3 Yidu Cloud (Beijing) Technology Co., Ltd, Beijing, China.', '4 Department of Computer Science, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China. tangbuzhou@gmail.com.', '5 Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China. tangbuzhou@gmail.com.']","Ying Xiong, Shuai Chen, Haoming Qin, He Cao, Yedan Shen, Xiaolong Wang, Qingcai Chen, Jun Yan, Buzhou Tang, ",BMC medical informatics and decision making,2020,Clinical semantic textual similarity; Distributed representation; Gated network; One-hot representation.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32349764
1152,An integrated machine learning model for aircraft components rare failure prognostics with log-based dataset,"Predictive maintenance is increasingly advancing into the aerospace industry, and it comes with diverse prognostic health management solutions. This type of maintenance can unlock several benefits for aerospace organizations. Such as preventing unexpected equipment downtime and improving service quality. In developing data-driven predictive modelling, one of the challenges that cause model performance degradation is the data-imbalanced distribution. The extreme data imbalanced problem arises when the distribution of the classes present in the datasets is not uniform. Such that the total number of instances in a class far outnumber those of the other classes. Extremely skew data distribution can lead to irregular patterns and trends, which affects the learning of temporal features. This paper proposes a hybrid machine learning approach that blends natural language processing techniques and ensemble learning for predicting extremely rare aircraft component failure. The proposed approach is tested using a real aircraft central maintenance system log-based dataset. The dataset is characterized by extremely rare occurrences of known unscheduled component replacements. The results suggest that the proposed approach outperformed the existing imbalanced and ensemble learning methods in terms of precision, recall, and f1-score. The proposed approach is approximately 10% better than the synthetic minority oversampling technique. It was also found that by searching for patterns in the minority class exclusively, the class imbalance problem could be overcome. Hence, the model classification performance is improved.","['1 Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) Center, Cranfield University, Bedford, MK430Al, United Kingdom.

1153,Impact of viral symptoms on the performance of the modified centor score to predict pediatric group A streptococcal pharyngitis,"Background:
      
    

    
      Clinicians use the Modified Centor Score (MCS) to estimate the risk of group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis in children with sore throat. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommends neither testing nor treating patients with specific viral symptoms. The goal of this study is to measure the impact of those symptoms on the yield of GAS testing predicted by the MCS. Methods:
      
    

    
      Retrospective cohort study of all patients aged 3-21 years presenting with sore throat and tested for GAS in a pediatric emergency department (ED) in 2016. After identifying all patients tested for GAS, we used natural language processing (NLP) to identify the subgroup complaining of sore throat. We abstracted all MCS variables as well as symptoms suggestive of a viral etiology per the IDSA guideline (conjunctivitis, coryza, cough, diarrhea, hoarseness, ulcerative oral lesions, viral exanthema). We calculated the proportion of patients who tested positive for GAS by MCS with and without viral symptoms. Results:
      
    

    
      Of the 1574 patients included, 372 patients (24%) tested GAS positive. Patients with at least one viral symptom had a reduced GAS risk compared to those without any of the viral symptoms 91/547 (17% GAS positive) vs. 281/1027 (27%), odds ratio 0.53 (95% CI 0.41-0.69). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The presence of viral symptoms specified by the IDSA alters the predicted yield of testing by traditional MCS. Clinicians may consider adjusting interpretation of a patient's MCS based on the presence of viral symptoms, but viral symptoms may not always fully obviate the need for GAS testing.","['1 Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston MA, United States; Departments of Pediatrics and Emergency Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States.

1154,Recovery of offline and online sentence processing in aphasia: Language and domain-general network neuroplasticity,"This paper examined the effects of treatment on both offline and online sentence processing and associated neuroplasticity within sentence processing and dorsal attention networks in chronic stroke-induced agrammatic aphasia. Twenty-three neurotypical adults and 19 individuals with aphasia served as participants. Aphasic individuals were randomly assigned to receive a 12-week course of linguistically-based treatment of passive sentence production and comprehension (N = 14, treatment group) or to serve as control participants (N = 5, natural history group). Both aphasic groups performed two offline tasks at baseline and three months following (at post-testing) to assess production and comprehension of trained passive structures and untrained syntactically related and unrelated structures. The aphasic participants and a healthy age-matched group also performed an online eyetracking comprehension task and a picture-verification fMRI task, which were repeated at post-testing for the aphasic groups. Results showed that individuals in the treatment, but not in the natural history, group improved on production and comprehension of both trained structures and untrained syntactically related structures. Treatment also resulted in a shift toward more normal-like eye movements and a significant increase in neural activation from baseline to post-testing. Upregulation encompassed right hemisphere regions homologs of left hemisphere regions involved in both sentence processing and domain-general functions and was positively correlated with treatment gains, as measured by offline comprehension accuracy, and with changes in processing strategies during sentence comprehension, as measured by eyetracking. These findings provide compelling evidence in favor of the contribution of both networks within the right hemisphere to the restoration of normal-like sentence processing patterns in chronic aphasia.","['1 Center for the Neurobiology of Language Recovery, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA.

1155,Understanding User Experience: Exploring Participants' Messages With a Web-Based Behavioral Health Intervention for Adolescents With Chronic Pain,"Background:
      
    

    
      Delivery of behavioral health interventions on the internet offers many benefits, including accessibility, cost-effectiveness, convenience, and anonymity. In recent years, an increased number of internet interventions have been developed, targeting a range of conditions and behaviors, including depression, pain, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and eating disorders. Human support (coaching) is a common component of internet interventions that is intended to boost engagement; however, little is known about how participants interact with coaches and how this may relate to their experience with the intervention. By examining the data that participants produce during an intervention, we can characterize their interaction patterns and refine treatments to address different needs. Objective:
      
    

    
      In this study, we employed text mining and visual analytics techniques to analyze messages exchanged between coaches and participants in an internet-delivered pain management intervention for adolescents with chronic pain and their parents. Methods:
      
    

    
      We explored the main themes in coaches' and participants' messages using an automated textual analysis method, topic modeling. We then clustered participants' messages to identify subgroups of participants with similar engagement patterns. Results:
      
    

    
      First, we performed topic modeling on coaches' messages. The themes in coaches' messages fell into 3 categories: Treatment Content, Administrative and Technical, and Rapport Building. Next, we employed topic modeling to identify topics from participants' message histories. Similar to the coaches' topics, these were subsumed under 3 high-level categories: Health Management and Treatment Content, Questions and Concerns, and Activities and Interests. Finally, the cluster analysis identified 4 clusters, each with a distinguishing characteristic: Assignment-Focused, Short Message Histories, Pain-Focused, and Activity-Focused. The name of each cluster exemplifies the main engagement patterns of that cluster. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      In this secondary data analysis, we demonstrated how automated text analysis techniques could be used to identify messages of interest, such as questions and concerns from users. In addition, we demonstrated how cluster analysis could be used to identify subgroups of individuals who share communication and engagement patterns, and in turn facilitate personalization of interventions for different subgroups of patients. This work makes 2 key methodological contributions. First, this study is innovative in its use of topic modeling to provide a rich characterization of the textual content produced by coaches and participants in an internet-delivered behavioral health intervention. Second, to our knowledge, this is the first example of the use of a visual analysis method to cluster participants and identify similar patterns of behavior based on intervention message content.","['1 Department of Biomedical Informatics and Medical Education, School of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States.', ""2 Department of Psychology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, United States."", '3 Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States.', ""4 Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development, Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle, WA, United States.""]","Annie T Chen, Aarti Swaminathan, William R Kearns, Nicole M Alberts, Emily F Law, Tonya M Palermo, ",Journal of medical Internet research,2019,chronic pain; cluster analysis; data visualization; natural language processing; technology.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30985288
1156,Evidence-based Clinical Decision Support Systems for the prediction and detection of three disease states in critical care: A systematic literature review,"Background: Clinical decision support (CDS) systems have emerged as tools providing intelligent decision making to address challenges of critical care. CDS systems can be based on existing guidelines or best practices; and can also utilize machine learning to provide a diagnosis, recommendation, or therapy course. Methods: This research aimed to identify evidence-based study designs and outcome measures to determine the clinical effectiveness of clinical decision support systems in the detection and prediction of hemodynamic instability, respiratory distress, and infection within critical care settings. PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were systematically searched to identify primary research published in English between 2013 and 2018. Studies conducted in the USA, Canada, UK, Germany and France with more than 10 participants per arm were included. Results: In studies on hemodynamic instability, the prediction and management of septic shock were the most researched topics followed by the early prediction of heart failure. For respiratory distress, the most popular topics were pneumonia detection and prediction followed by pulmonary embolisms. Given the importance of imaging and clinical notes, this area combined Machine Learning with image analysis and natural language processing. In studies on infection, the most researched areas were the detection, prediction, and management of sepsis, surgical site infections, as well as acute kidney injury. Overall, a variety of Machine Learning algorithms were utilized frequently, particularly support vector machines, boosting techniques, random forest classifiers and neural networks. Sensitivity, specificity, and ROC AUC were the most frequently reported performance measures. Conclusion: This review showed an increasing use of Machine Learning for CDS in all three areas. Large datasets are required for training these algorithms; making it imperative to appropriately address, challenges such as class imbalance, correct labelling of data and missing data. Recommendations are formulated for the development and successful adoption of CDS systems.","['1 Health Economics, Philips, Eindhoven, Noord-Brabant, 5621JG, The Netherlands.', '2 Department of Pharmacy, Unit of PharmacoTherapy, -Epidemiology & -Economics, University of Groningen, Groningen, 9700 AB, The Netherlands.', '3 Global Market Access Solutions Sàrl, St-Prex, 1162, Switzerland.', '4 Philips, Cambridge, MA, 02141, USA.', '5 Department of Health Sciences, University Medical Centre Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, 9700 AB, The Netherlands.', '6 Department of Economics, Econometrics & Finance, University of Groningen, Groningen, 9700 AB, The Netherlands.']","Goran Medic, Melodi Kosaner Kließ, Louis Atallah, Jochen Weichert, Saswat Panda, Maarten Postma, Amer El-Kerdi, ",F1000Research,2019,clinical trials; critical care.; hemodynamic instability; infection; machine learning; respiratory distress; sepsis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31824670
1157,Experience of Ambulatory Cancer Care: Understanding Patients' Perspectives of Quality Using Sentiment Analysis,"Background:
      
    

    
      The move of cancer treatment into the outpatient setting can impact patient experience. Understanding how service delivery change impacts different people requires service feedback to inform future delivery development. The use of patient experience questionnaires often generates large amount of free-text data that are difficult to analyze. Objective:
      
    

    
      The aim of this study was to describe a proof-of-concept study exploring the experiences and perceptions of people undergoing cancer treatment, using novel analysis techniques to provide rapid free-text data analysis. Method:
      
    

    
      This was a mixed-methods qualitative analysis from qualitative questions gathered in Finland using the National Cancer Patient Experience Survey (n = 92 of 208 patients) and supplemented with 7 focus groups (31 people with cancer). Data were analyzed using natural language processing, via an automated sentiment analysis algorithm and supported with focus groups to inform the initial thematic analysis. Results:
      
    

    
      Participants were on average 65 years of age. Of the 196 free-text comments, 121 (73.6%) were positive about patient experiences and 75 (38.5%) negative with suggestions for improvement. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Communication between patients and clinicians was an indicator of quality, and lack of psychological support was a barrier to quality care provision. The methodology of using sentiment analysis for free content to review quality was demonstrated through this study as a novel and feasible method to look at large-scale qualitative data. Implications for practice:
      
    

    
      Using the free content on experience of care questionnaire to review gaps or needs in services is valuable in developing future practice.","['1 Author affiliations: Department of Nursing Science, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Eastern Finland (Drs Vehviläinen-Julkunen and Kvist and Ms Ryden-Kortelainen); and Kuopio University Hospital (Drs Vehviläinen-Julkunen and Turpeinen, Ms Nelimarkka), Finland; and Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences, Centre for Vision, Speech and Language Processing (Dr Enshaeifar), and Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Surrey (Dr Faithfull), Guildford, United Kingdom.

1158,"Detection of acute 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) effects across protocols using automated natural language processing","The detection of changes in mental states such as those caused by psychoactive drugs relies on clinical assessments that are inherently subjective. Automated speech analysis may represent a novel method to detect objective markers, which could help improve the characterization of these mental states. In this study, we employed computer-extracted speech features from multiple domains (acoustic, semantic, and psycholinguistic) to assess mental states after controlled administration of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and intranasal oxytocin. The training/validation set comprised within-participants data from 31 healthy adults who, over four sessions, were administered MDMA (0.75, 1.5 mg/kg), oxytocin (20 IU), and placebo in randomized, double-blind fashion. Participants completed two 5-min speech tasks during peak drug effects. Analyses included group-level comparisons of drug conditions and estimation of classification at the individual level within this dataset and on two independent datasets. Promising classification results were obtained to detect drug conditions, achieving cross-validated accuracies of up to 87% in training/validation and 92% in the independent datasets, suggesting that the detected patterns of speech variability are associated with drug consumption. Specifically, we found that oxytocin seems to be mostly driven by changes in emotion and prosody, which are mainly captured by acoustic features. In contrast, mental states driven by MDMA consumption appear to manifest in multiple domains of speech. Furthermore, we find that the experimental task has an effect on the speech response within these mental states, which can be attributed to presence or absence of an interaction with another individual. These results represent a proof-of-concept application of the potential of speech to provide an objective measurement of mental states elicited during intoxication.","['1 Computational Biology Center - Neuroscience, IBM T.J.

PMI and word2vec reveal semantic relationships between words and can be helpful in a range of applications such as document indexing, topic analysis, or document categorization. We use probability theory to demonstrate the relationship between PMI and word2vec. We use the theoretical results to demonstrate how the PMI can be modeled and estimated in a simple and straight forward manner. We further describe how one can obtain standard error estimates that account for within-patient clustering that arises from patterns of repeated words within a patient's health record due to a unique health history. We then demonstrate the usefulness of PMI on the problem of predictive identification of disease from free text notes of electronic health records. Specifically, we use our methods to distinguish those with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus in electronic health record free text data using over 400 000 clinical notes from an academic medical center.","['1 Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Facility, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Temple University Health System, Philadelphia, PA.', '2 Department of Computer and Information Sciences, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA.', '3 Department of Surgical Oncology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA.', '4 Population Studies Facility, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA.']","Brian L Egleston, Tian Bai, Richard J Bleicher, Stanford J Taylor, Michael H Lutz, Slobodan Vucetic, ",Biometrics,2020,cluster-corrected standard errors; electronic health records; natural language processing; probability models; word2vec.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32700317
1160,Structured report data can be used to develop deep learning algorithms: a proof of concept in ankle radiographs,"Background:
      
    

    
      Data used for training of deep learning networks usually needs large amounts of accurate labels. These labels are usually extracted from reports using natural language processing or by time-consuming manual review. The aim of this study was therefore to develop and evaluate a workflow for using data from structured reports as labels to be used in a deep learning application. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      We included all plain anteriorposterior radiographs of the ankle for which structured reports were available. A workflow was designed and implemented where a script was used to automatically retrieve, convert, and anonymize the respective radiographs of cases where fractures were either present or absent from the institution's picture archiving and communication system (PACS). These images were then used to retrain a pretrained deep convolutional neural network. Finally, performance was evaluated on a set of previously unseen radiographs. Results:
      
    

    
      Once implemented and configured, completion of the whole workflow took under 1 h. A total of 157 structured reports were retrieved from the reporting platform. For all structured reports, corresponding radiographs were successfully retrieved from the PACS and fed into the training process. On an unseen validation subset, the model showed a satisfactory performance with an area under the curve of 0.850 (95% CI 0.634-1.000) for detection of fractures. Conclusion:

Natural language processing (NLP) may provide a useful method to assess cognitive status in this population. We identified 81 liver transplant recipients with ESLD (4/2013-2/2018) who sent at least one patient-to-provider electronic message pre-transplant and post-transplant, and matched them 1:1 to ""healthy"" controls-who had similar disease, but had not been evaluated for liver transplant-by age, gender, race/ethnicity, and liver disease. Messages written by patients pre-transplant and post-transplant and controls was compared across 19 NLP measures using paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. While there was no difference overall in word length, patients with Model for End-Stage Liver Disease Score (MELD) ≥ 30 (n = 31) had decreased word length in pre-transplant messages (3.95 [interquartile range (IQR) 3.79, 4.14]) compared to post-transplant (4.13 [3.96, 4.28], p = 0.01) and controls (4.2 [4.0, 4.4], p = 0.01); there was no difference between post-transplant and controls (p = 0.4). Patients with MELD ≥ 30 had fewer 6+ letter words in pre-transplant messages (19.5% [16.4, 25.9] compared to post-transplant (23.4% [20.0, 26.7] p = 0.02) and controls (25.0% [19.2, 29.4]; p = 0.01). Overall, patients had increased sentence length pre-transplant (12.0 [9.8, 13.7]) compared to post-transplant (11.0 [9.2, 13.3]; p = 0.046); the same was seen for MELD ≥ 30 (12.3 [9.8, 13.7] pre-transplant vs. 10.8 [9.6, 13.0] post-transplant; p = 0.050). Application of NLP to patient-generated messages identified language differences-longer sentences with shorter words-that resolved after transplant.

After training, inference was performed using variable importance and partial dependence plots. Results:
      
    

    
      The RF, DT, and LR algorithms with all features had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.78, 0.77, and 0.75, respectively, and significantly outperformed the LR with only operator features (LROP), with an AUC of 0.61. The most important features were experience, familiarity, total words, and character-based metrics. The partial dependence plots showed that steps with fewer words, abbreviations, and characters were correlated with correct step performance. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Machine learning algorithms are a promising approach for predicting step-level procedure performance, with acknowledged limitations on interpolating to nonobserved data, and may help guide procedure design after validation with additional data on further tasks. Application:

1163,Automatic Semantic Description Extraction from Social Big Data for Emergency Management,"Emergency events are unexpected and dangerous situations which the authorities must manage and respond to as quickly as possible. The main objectives of emergency management are to provide human safety and security, and Social Big Data (SBD) offers an important information source, created directly from eyewitness reports, to assist with these issues. However, the manual extraction of hidden meaning from SBD is both time-consuming and labor-intensive, which are major drawbacks for a process that needs accurate information to be produced in real-time. The solution is an automatic approach to knowledge discovery, and we propose a semantic description technique based on the use of triple store indexing for named entity recognition and relation extraction. Our technique can discover hidden SBD information more effectively than traditional approaches, and can be used for intelligent emergency management.","['1 Department of Computer Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Prince of Songkla University, Songkla, Thailand.']","Bukhoree Sahoh, Anant Choksuriwong, ",Journal of systems science and systems engineering,2020,Ontology; information extraction; named entity recognition; natural language processing; semantic index; triplestore.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32837111
1164,Informational masking of speech by acoustically similar intelligible and unintelligible interferers,"Masking experienced when target speech is accompanied by a single interfering voice is often primarily informational masking (IM). IM is generally greater when the interferer is intelligible than when it is not (e.g., speech from an unfamiliar language), but the relative contributions of acoustic-phonetic and linguistic interference are often difficult to assess owing to acoustic differences between interferers (e.g., different talkers). Three-formant analogues (F1+F2+F3) of natural sentences were used as targets and interferers. Targets were presented monaurally either alone or accompanied contralaterally by interferers from another sentence (F0 = 4 semitones higher); a target-to-masker ratio (TMR) between ears of 0, 6, or 12 dB was used. Interferers were either intelligible or rendered unintelligible by delaying F2 and advancing F3 by 150 ms relative to F1, a manipulation designed to minimize spectro-temporal differences between corresponding interferers. Target-sentence intelligibility (keywords correct) was 67% when presented alone, but fell considerably when an unintelligible interferer was present (49%) and significantly further when the interferer was intelligible (41%). Changes in TMR produced neither a significant main effect nor an interaction with interferer type. Interference with acoustic-phonetic processing of the target can explain much of the impact on intelligibility, but linguistic factors-particularly interferer intrusions-also make an important contribution to IM.","['1 Psychology, School of Life and Health Sciences, Aston University, Birmingham B4 7ET, United Kingdom.']","Robert J Summers, Brian Roberts, ",The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America,2020 Feb,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32113320
1165,Structure in the stream of consciousness: Evidence from a verbalized thought protocol and automated text analytic methods,"A key question about the spontaneous stream of thought (SST), often called the stream of consciousness, concerns its serial structure: How are thoughts in an extended sequence related to each other? In this study, we used a verbalized thought protocol to investigate ""clump-and-jump"" structure in SST-clusters of related thoughts about a topic followed by a jump to a new topic, in a repeating pattern. Several lines of evidence convergently supported the presence of clump-and-jump structure: high interrater agreement in identifying jumps, corroboration of rater-assigned jumps by automated text analytic methods, identification of clumps and jumps by a data-driven algorithm, and the inferred presence of clumps and jumps in unverbalized SST. We also found evidence that jumps involve a discontinuous shift in which a new clump is only modestly related to the previous one. These results illuminate serial structure in SST and invite research into the processes that generate the clump-and-jump pattern.","['1 Department of Philosophy, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States; Department of Psychiatry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States.

1166,Applied Deep Learning in Plastic Surgery: Classifying Rhinoplasty With a Mobile App,"Background:
      
    

    
      Advances in deep learning (DL) have been transformative in computer vision and natural language processing, as well as in healthcare. The authors present a novel application of DL to plastic surgery. Here, the authors describe and demonstrate the mobile deployment of a deep neural network that predicts rhinoplasty status, assess model accuracy compared to surgeons, and describe future directions for such applications in plastic surgery. Methods:
      
    

    
      A deep convolutional neural network (""RhinoNet"") was developed to classify rhinoplasty images using only pixels and rhinoplasty status labels (""before""/""after"") as inputs. RhinoNet was trained using a dataset of 22,686 before and after photos which were collected from publicly available sites. Network classification was compared to that of plastic surgery attendings and residents on 2269 previously-unseen test-set images. Results:
      
    

    
      RhinoNet correctly predicted rhinoplasty status in 85% of the test-set images. Sensitivity and specificity of model predictions were 0.840 (0.79-0.89) and 0.826 (0.77-0.88), respectively; the corresponding values for expert consensus predictions were 0.814 (0.76-0.87) and 0.867 (0.82-0.91). RhinoNet and humans performed with effectively equivalent accuracy in this classification task. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The authors describe the development of DL applications to identify the presence of superficial surgical procedures solely from images and labels. DL is especially well suited for unstructured, high-fidelity visual and auditory data that does not lend itself to classical statistical analysis, and may be deployed as mobile applications for potentially unbridled use, so the authors expect DL to play a key role in many areas of plastic surgery.","['1 Department of Plastic Surgery, University of California, Irvine, CA.', '2 Cleveland Institute for Computational Biology, Department of Population and Quantitative Health Sciences, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine.', '3 Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Department of Surgery, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, OH.']","Emily Borsting, Robert DeSimone, Mustafa Ascha, Mona Ascha, ",The Journal of craniofacial surgery,Jan/Feb 2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31633665
1167,A network model of activities in primary care consultations,"Objective:
      
    

    
      The objective of this study is to characterize the dynamic structure of primary care consultations by identifying typical activities and their inter-relationships to inform the design of automated approaches to clinical documentation using natural language processing and summarization methods. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      This is an observational study in Australian general practice involving 31 consultations with 4 primary care physicians. Consultations were audio-recorded, and computer interactions were recorded using screen capture. Physical interactions in consultation rooms were noted by observers. Brief interviews were conducted after consultations. Conversational transcripts were analyzed to identify different activities and their speech content as well as verbal cues signaling activity transitions. An activity transition analysis was then undertaken to generate a network of activities and transitions. Results:
      
    

    
      Observed activity classes followed those described in well-known primary care consultation models. Activities were often fragmented across consultations, did not flow necessarily in a defined order, and the flow between activities was nonlinear. Modeling activities as a network revealed that discussing a patient's present complaint was the most central activity and was highly connected to medical history taking, physical examination, and assessment, forming a highly interrelated bundle. Family history, allergy, and investigation discussions were less connected suggesting less dependency on other activities. Clear verbal signs were often identifiable at transitions between activities. Discussion:
      
    

    
      Primary care consultations do not appear to follow a classic linear model of defined information seeking activities; rather, they are fragmented, highly interdependent, and can be reactively triggered. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The nonlinearity of activities has significant implications for the design of automated information capture. Whereas dictation systems generate literal translation of speech into text, speech-based clinical summary systems will need to link disparate information fragments, merge their content, and abstract coherent information summaries.","['1 Australian Institute of Health Innovation, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia.', '2 Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia.', '3 Health Sciences Centre, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia.']","Ahmet Baki Kocaballi, Enrico Coiera, Huong Ly Tong, Sarah J White, Juan C Quiroz, Fahimeh Rezazadegan, Simon Willcock, Liliana Laranjo, ",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2019,digital scribe; electronic health record; general practitioners; medical informatics; primary health care; speech-based summarization.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31329875
1168,Bi-Directional Evidence Linking Sentence Production and Comprehension: A Cross-Modality Structural Priming Study,"Natural language involves both speaking and listening. Recent models claim that production and comprehension share aspects of processing and are linked within individuals (Pickering and Garrod, 2004, 2013; MacDonald, 2013; Dell and Chang, 2014). Evidence for this claim has come from studies of cross-modality structural priming, mainly examining processing in the direction of comprehension to production. The current study replicated these comprehension to production findings and developed a novel cross-modal structural priming paradigm from production to comprehension using a temporally sensitive online measure of comprehension, Event-Related Potentials. For Comprehension-to-Production priming, participants first listened to active or passive sentences and then described target pictures using either structure. In Production-to-Comprehension priming, participants first described a picture using either structure and then listened to target passive sentences while EEG was recorded. Comprehension-to-Production priming showed the expected passive sentence priming for syntactic choice, but not response time (RT) or average syllable duration. In Production-to-Comprehension priming, primed, versus unprimed, passive sentences elicited a reduced N400. These effects support the notion that production and comprehension share aspects of processing and are linked within the individual. Moreover, this paradigm can be used for the exploration priming at different linguistic levels as well as the influence of extra-linguistic factors on natural language use.","['1 Aphasia and Neurolinguistics Research Laboratory, Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, United States.', '2 Bilingualism and Language Development Lab, Department of Psychology, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, United States.']","Kaitlyn A Litcofsky, Janet G van Hell, ",Frontiers in psychology,2019,comprehension; cross-modality structural priming; event-related potentials; production; sentence processing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31191379
1169,Phenotypic clustering of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction reveals different rates of hospitalization,"Aims:
      
    

    
      Approximately 50% of patients with heart failure have preserved (≥50%) ejection fraction (HFpEF). Improved understanding of the phenotypic heterogeneity of HFpEF might facilitate development of targeted therapies and interventions. Methods:
      
    

    
      This retrospective study characterized a cohort of patients with HFpEF based on similar clinical profiles and evaluated 1-year heart failure related hospitalization. Enrolment, medical and pharmacy data were used to identify patients newly diagnosed with heart failure enrolled in a Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug or commercial healthcare plan. To identify only those patients with HFpEF, we used natural language processing techniques of ejection fraction values abstracted from a linked free-text clinical notes data source. The study population comprised 1515 patients newly identified with HFpEF between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2015. Results:
      
    

    
      Using unsupervised machine learning, we identified three distinguishable patient clusters representing different phenotypes: cluster-1 patients had the lowest prevalence of heart failure comorbidities and highest mean age; cluster-2 patients had higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome and pulmonary disease, despite younger mean age; and cluster-3 patients had higher prevalence of cardiac arrhythmia and renal disease. Cluster-3 had the highest 1-year heart failure related hospitalization rates. Within-cluster analysis, prior use of diuretics (cluster-1 and cluster-2) and age (cluster-2 and cluster-3) was associated with 1-year heart failure related hospitalization. Combination therapy was associated with decreased 1-year heart failure related hospitalization in cluster-1. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      This study demonstrated that clustering can be used to characterize subgroups of patients with newly identified HFpEF, assess differences in heart failure related hospitalization rates at 1 year and suggest patient subtypes may respond differently to treatments or interventions.","['1 Humana Healthcare Research, Inc.', '2 Healthcare Services, Humana Inc, Louisville, Kentucky, USA.', '3 Digital & Commercial Innovation, Bayer AG, Wuppertal, Germany.']","Adrianne Casebeer, Libby Horter, Jennifer Hayden, Jeff Simmons, Thomas Evers, ","Journal of cardiovascular medicine (Hagerstown, Md.)",2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32941326
1170,Machine learning applications to clinical decision support in neurosurgery: an artificial intelligence augmented systematic review,"Machine learning (ML) involves algorithms learning patterns in large, complex datasets to predict and classify. Algorithms include neural networks (NN), logistic regression (LR), and support vector machines (SVM). ML may generate substantial improvements in neurosurgery. This systematic review assessed the current state of neurosurgical ML applications and the performance of algorithms applied. Our systematic search strategy yielded 6866 results, 70 of which met inclusion criteria. Performance statistics analyzed included area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Natural language processing (NLP) was used to model topics across the corpus and to identify keywords within surgical subspecialties. ML applications were heterogeneous. The densest cluster of studies focused on preoperative evaluation, planning, and outcome prediction in spine surgery. The main algorithms applied were NN, LR, and SVM. Input and output features varied widely and were listed to facilitate future research. The accuracy (F(2,19) = 6.56, p < 0.01) and specificity (F(2,16) = 5.57, p < 0.01) of NN, LR, and SVM differed significantly. NN algorithms demonstrated significantly higher accuracy than LR. SVM demonstrated significantly higher specificity than LR. We found no significant difference between NN, LR, and SVM AUC and sensitivity. NLP topic modeling reached maximum coherence at seven topics, which were defined by modeling approach, surgery type, and pathology themes. Keywords captured research foci within surgical domains. ML technology accurately predicts outcomes and facilitates clinical decision-making in neurosurgery. NNs frequently outperformed other algorithms on supervised learning tasks.

      The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), broke out in December 2019, is a global pandemic. Rapidly in the past few months, a large number of clinical studies have been initiated worldwide to find effective therapeutics, vaccines, and preventive strategies. In this study, we aim to understand the landscape of COVID-19 clinical research and identify the gaps and issues that may cause difficulty in recruitment and the lack of population representativeness. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      We analyzed 2,034 COVID-19 studies registered in the largest public registry - ClinicalTrials.gov. Leveraging natural language processing, descriptive analysis, association analysis, and clustering analysis, we characterized COVID-19 clinical studies by phase and design features. Particularly, we analyzed their eligibility criteria to understand: (1) whether they considered the reported underlying health conditions that may lead to severe illnesses, and (2) if these studies excluded older adults, either explicitly or implicitly, which may reduce the generalizability of these studies in older adults. Results:

      Existing methods for measuring adverse events in hospitals intercept a restricted number of events. Text mining refers to a range of techniques to extract data from narrative sources. The goal of this study was to evaluate the performance of an automated approach for extracting adverse event keywords from within electronic health records. Methods:
      
    

    
      The study involved 4 medical centers in the Region of Lombardy. A starting set of keywords was trained in an iterative process to develop queries for 7 adverse events, including those used by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality as patient safety indicators. We calculated positive predictive values of the 7 queries and performed an error analysis to detect reasons for false-positive cases of pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, and urinary tract infection. Results:
      
    

    
      Overall, 397,233 records were collected (34,805 discharge summaries, 292,593 emergency department notes, and 69,835 operation reports). Positive predictive values were higher for postoperative wound dehiscence (83.83%) and urinary tract infection (73.07%), whereas they were lower for deep vein thrombosis (5.37%), pulmonary embolism (13.63%), and postoperative sepsis (12.28%). The most common reasons for false positives were reporting of past events (42.25%), negations (22.80%), and conditions suspected by physicians but not confirmed by a diagnostic test (11.25%). Conclusions:

Identifying at-risk patients can facilitate interventions to lower risk. We sought to develop a hypoglycemia prediction model. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, urban adults prescribed a diabetes drug between 2004 and 2013 were identified. Demographic and clinical data were extracted from an electronic medical record (EMR). Laboratory tests, diagnostic codes and natural language processing (NLP) identified hypoglycemia. We compared multiple logistic regression, classification and regression trees (CART), and random forest. Models were evaluated on an independent test set or through cross-validation. Results: The 38,780 patients had mean age 57 years; 56% were female, 40% African-American and 39% uninsured. Hypoglycemia occurred in 8128 (539 identified only by NLP). In logistic regression, factors positively associated with hypoglycemia included infection, non-long-acting insulin, dementia and recent hypoglycemia. Negatively associated factors included long-acting insulin plus sulfonylurea, and age 75 or older. The models' area under curve was similar (logistic regression, 89%; CART, 88%; random forest, 90%, with ten-fold cross-validation). Conclusions: NLP improved identification of hypoglycemia. Non-long-acting insulin was an important risk factor. Decreased risk with age may reflect treatment or diminished awareness of hypoglycemia. More complex models did not improve prediction.","['1 Indiana University , Indianapolis , IN , USA.', '2 Merck & Co.

      This work deals with clinical text mining, a field of Natural Language Processing applied to biomedical informatics. The aim is to classify Electronic Health Records with respect to the International Classification of Diseases, which is the foundation for the identification of international health statistics, and the standard for reporting diseases and health conditions. Within the framework of data mining, the goal is the multi-label classification, as each health record has assigned multiple International Classification of Diseases codes. We investigate five Deep Learning architectures with a dataset obtained from the Basque Country Health System, and six different perspectives derived from shifts in the input and the output. Methods:
      
    

    
      We evaluate a Feed Forward Neural Network as the baseline and several Recurrent models based on the Bidirectional GRU architecture, putting our research focus on the text representation layer and testing three variants, from standard word embeddings to meta word embeddings techniques and contextual embeddings. Results:
      
    

    
      The results showed that the recurrent models overcome the non-recurrent model. The meta word embeddings techniques are capable of beating the standard word embeddings, but the contextual embeddings exhibit as the most robust for the downstream task overall. Additionally, the label-granularity alone has an impact on the classification performance. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The contributions of this work are a) a comparison among five classification approaches based on Deep Learning on a Spanish dataset to cope with the multi-label health text classification problem; b) the study of the impact of document length and label-set size and granularity in the multi-label context; and c) the study of measures to mitigate multi-label text classification problems related to label-set size and sparseness.","['1 IXA Taldea.

1175,Incorporating Demographic Embeddings Into Language Understanding,"Meaning depends on context. This applies in obvious cases like deictics or sarcasm as well as more subtle situations like framing or persuasion. One key aspect of this is the identity of the participants in an interaction. Our interpretation of an utterance shifts based on a variety of factors, including personal history, background knowledge, and our relationship to the source. While obviously an incomplete model of individual differences, demographic factors provide a useful starting point and allow us to capture some of this variance. However, the relevance of specific demographic factors varies between situations-where age might be the key factor in one context, ideology might dominate in another. To address this challenge, we introduce a method for combining demographics and context into situated demographic embeddings-mapping representations into a continuous geometric space appropriate for the given domain, showing the resulting representations to be functional and interpretable. We further demonstrate how to make use of related external data so as to apply this approach in low-resource situations. Finally, we show how these representations can be incorporated into improve modeling of real-world natural language understanding tasks, improving model performance and helping with issues of data sparsity.","['1 Department of Computer Science, University of Southern California.', '2 Brain and Creativity Institute, University of Southern California.', '3 Department of Psychology, University of Southern California.', '4 Department of Linguistics, University of California, Davis.']","Justin Garten, Brendan Kennedy, Joe Hoover, Kenji Sagae, Morteza Dehghani, ",Cognitive science,2019 Jan,Continuous representations; Demographic representation; Moral reasoning; Natural language processing; Neural networks.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30648795

      Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are linked to negative health outcomes in adulthood. Poor engagement with services may, in part, mediate the association between adverse outcomes and ACEs. While appointment recording is comprehensive, it is not yet known if or how ACEs are recorded in the GP clinical record (GPR). Aim:
      
    

    
      To investigate recording of ACEs in the GPR and assess associations between available ACE-related Read codes and missed appointments. Design & setting:
      
    

    
      Retrospective cohort study of 824 374 anonymised GPRs. Nationally representative sample of 136 Scottish general practices; data collected 2013-2016. Method:
      
    

    
      Read codes were mapped onto ACE questionnaire and wider ACE-related domains. Natural language processing (NLP) was used to augment capture of non-Read-coded ACEs. Frequency counts and proportions of mapped codes, and associations of these with defined levels of missing GP appointments, are reported. Results:
      
    

    
      In total, 0.4% of patients had a record of any code that mapped onto the ACE questionnaire, contrasting with survey-reported rates of 47% in population samples. This increased only modestly by including inferred ACEs that related to safeguarding children concerns, wider aspects of ACEs, and adult consequences of ACEs. Augmentation via NLP did not substantially increase capture. Despite poor recording, there was an association between ever having an ACE code recorded and higher rates of missing GP appointments.

1178,"Contact Lens Wear, Corneal Complications, and U.S. Service Member Readiness","Introduction:
      
    

    
      Ulcerative keratitis (UK), or corneal ulcer, is a sight-threatening and readiness-lowering medical condition that begins with a corneal infiltrative event (CIE). Contact lens (CL) wear poses a particular risk for a CIE and therefore is restricted for most active duty service members (SMs). In this study, we explored a large Department of Defense/Veterans Affairs (DoD/VA) database to estimate the prevalence of UK and CIE and their association with CL wear. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      The DoD/VA Defense and Veterans Eye Injury Vision Registry, an initiative of the DoD/VA Vision Center of Excellence, was explored using natural language processing software to search for words and diagnostic codes that might identify cornea injuries and CL wear. The effect of UK and CIE on readiness was explored by evaluating the duration between the first and final visits noted in the database. Results:
      
    

    
      A total of 213 UK cases were identified among the 27,402 SMs for whom data were recorded in Defense and Veterans Eye Injury Vision Registry. The odds ratios of UK and CIE being associated with CL wear were 13.34 and 2.20, respectively. A less specific code (superficial corneal injury) was found to be the most commonly used diagnosis in the database, and the odds ratio of CL wearers having that diagnosis was 2.25. CL-wearing patients with corneal disease also required more clinic encounters than those who did not wear CLs. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      This study supports the current restriction on CL wear among nonpilot active duty SMs and quantifies the significantly enhanced risk of developing corneal ulcers posed by that habit.","['1 Computer Technology Associates, Inc., 543 W.

1179,Balancing Prediction and Sensory Input in Speech Comprehension: The Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Word Recognition in Context,"Spoken word recognition in context is remarkably fast and accurate, with recognition times of ∼200 ms, typically well before the end of the word. The neurocomputational mechanisms underlying these contextual effects are still poorly understood. This study combines source-localized electroencephalographic and magnetoencephalographic (EMEG) measures of real-time brain activity with multivariate representational similarity analysis to determine directly the timing and computational content of the processes evoked as spoken words are heard in context, and to evaluate the respective roles of bottom-up and predictive processing mechanisms in the integration of sensory and contextual constraints. Male and female human participants heard simple (modifier-noun) English phrases that varied in the degree of semantic constraint that the modifier (W1) exerted on the noun (W2), as in pairs, such as ""yellow banana."" We used gating tasks to generate estimates of the probabilistic predictions generated by these constraints as well as measures of their interaction with the bottom-up perceptual input for W2. Representation similarity analysis models of these measures were tested against electroencephalographic and magnetoencephalographic brain data across a bilateral fronto-temporo-parietal language network. Consistent with probabilistic predictive processing accounts, we found early activation of semantic constraints in frontal cortex (LBA45) as W1 was heard. The effects of these constraints (at 100 ms after W2 onset in left middle temporal gyrus and at 140 ms in left Heschl's gyrus) were only detectable, however, after the initial phonemes of W2 had been heard. Within an overall predictive processing framework, bottom-up sensory inputs are still required to achieve early and robust spoken word recognition in context.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Human listeners recognize spoken words in natural speech contexts with remarkable speed and accuracy, often identifying a word well before all of it has been heard. In this study, we investigate the brain systems that support this important capacity, using neuroimaging techniques that can track real-time brain activity during speech comprehension. This makes it possible to locate the brain areas that generate predictions about upcoming words and to show how these expectations are integrated with the evidence provided by the speech being heard. We use the timing and localization of these effects to provide the most specific account to date of how the brain achieves an optimal balance between prediction and sensory input in the interpretation of spoken language.","['1 Centre for Speech, Language and the Brain, Department of Psychology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 3EB, United Kingdom.', '2 Centre for Speech, Language and the Brain, Department of Psychology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 3EB, United Kingdom lktyler@csl.psychol.cam.ac.uk.']","Anastasia Klimovich-Gray, Lorraine K Tyler, Billi Randall, Ece Kocagoncu, Barry Devereux, William D Marslen-Wilson, ",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2019,RSA; language; prediction; speech; time-course; word recognition.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30459221
1180,Rich Text Formatted EHR Narratives: A Hidden and Ignored Trove,"This study presents an approach for mining structured information from clinical narratives in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) by using Rich Text Formatted (RTF) records. RTF is adopted by many medical information management systems. There is rich structural information in these files which can be extracted and interpreted, yet such information is largely ignored. We investigate multiple types of EHR narratives in the Enterprise Data Warehouse from a multisite large healthcare chain consisting of both, an academic medical center and community hospitals. We focus on the RTF constructs related to tables and sections that are not available in plain text EHR narratives. We show how to parse these RTF constructs, analyze their prevalence and characteristics in the context of multiple types of EHR narratives. Our case study demonstrates the additional utility of the features derived from RTF constructs over plain text oriented NLP.","['1 Department of Preventive Medicine, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', '2 Hospital Medicine, Northwestern Memorial Hospital, Chicago, IL, USA.', '3 Committee on Developmental Biology and Regenerative Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.']","Zexian Zeng, Yuan Zhao, Mengxin Sun, Andy H Vo, Justin Starren, Yuan Luo, ",Studies in health technology and informatics,2019,Electronic Health Records; Information Management; Natural Language Processing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31437968
1181,A common variant in PNPLA3 is associated with age at diagnosis of NAFLD in patients from a multi-ethnic biobank,"Background & aims:
      
    

    
      The Ile138Met variant (rs738409) in the PNPLA3 gene has the largest effect on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), increasing the risk of progression to severe forms of liver disease. It remains unknown if the variant plays a role in age of NAFLD onset. We aimed to determine if rs738409 impacts on the age of NAFLD diagnosis. Methods:
      
    

    
      We applied a novel natural language processing (NLP) algorithm to a longitudinal electronic health records (EHR) dataset of >27,000 individuals with genetic data from a multi-ethnic biobank, defining NAFLD cases (n = 1,703) and confirming controls (n = 8,119). We conducted i) a survival analysis to determine if age at diagnosis differed by rs738409 genotype, ii) a receiver operating characteristics analysis to assess the utility of the rs738409 genotype in discriminating NAFLD cases from controls, and iii) a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) between rs738409 and 10,095 EHR-derived disease diagnoses. Results:
      
    

    
      The PNPLA3 G risk allele was associated with: i) earlier age of NAFLD diagnosis, with the strongest effect in Hispanics (hazard ratio 1.33; 95% CI 1.15-1.53; p <0.0001) among whom a NAFLD diagnosis was 15% more likely in risk allele carriers vs. non-carriers; ii) increased NAFLD risk (odds ratio 1.61; 95% CI 1.349-1.73; p <0.0001), with the strongest effect among Hispanics (odds ratio 1.43; 95% CI 1.28-1.59; p <0.0001); iii) additional liver diseases in a PheWAS (p <4.95 × 10-6) where the risk variant also associated with earlier age of diagnosis. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Given the role of the rs738409 in NAFLD diagnosis age, our results suggest that stratifying risk within populations known to have an enhanced risk of liver disease, such as Hispanic carriers of the rs738409 variant, would be effective in earlier identification of those who would benefit most from early NAFLD prevention and treatment strategies. Lay summary:
      
    

    
      Despite clear associations between the PNPLA3 rs738409 variant and elevated risk of progression from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to more severe forms of liver disease, it remains unknown if PNPLA3 rs738409 plays a role in the age of NAFLD onset. Herein, we found that this risk variant is associated with an earlier age of NAFLD and other liver disease diagnoses; an observation most pronounced in Hispanic Americans. We conclude that PNPLA3 rs738409 could be used to better understand liver disease risk within vulnerable populations and identify patients that may benefit from early prevention strategies.","['1 The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, USA; Department of Environmental Medicine and Public Health, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, USA.

1182,Representing Multiword Chemical Terms through Phrase-Level Preprocessing and Word Embedding,"In recent years, data-driven methods and artificial intelligence have been widely used in chemoinformatic and material informatics domains, for which the success is critically determined by the availability of training data with good quality and large quantity. A potential approach to break this bottleneck is by leveraging the chemical literature such as papers and patents as alternative data resources to high throughput experiments and simulation. Compared to other domains where natural language processing techniques have established successes, the chemical literature contains a large portion of phrases of multiple words that create additional challenges for accurate identification and representation. Here, we introduce a chemistry domain suitable approach to identify multiword chemical terms and train word representations at the phrase level. Through a series of special-designed experiments, we demonstrate that our multiword identifying and representing method effectively and accurately identifies multiword chemical terms from 119, 166 chemical patents and is more robust and precise to preserve the semantic meaning of chemical phrases compared to the conventional approach, which represents constituent single words first and combine them afterward. Because the accurate representation of chemical terms is the first and essential step to provide learning features for downstream natural language processing tasks, our results pave the road to utilize the large volume of chemical literature in future data-driven studies.","['1 Toyota Research Institute of North America, 1555 Woodridge Avenue, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48105, United States.']","Liyuan Huang, Chen Ling, ",ACS omega,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31737809
1183,Identifying and Predicting Intentional Self-Harm in Electronic Health Record Clinical Notes: Deep Learning Approach,"Background:
      
    

    
      Suicide is an important public health concern in the United States and around the world. There has been significant work examining machine learning approaches to identify and predict intentional self-harm and suicide using existing data sets. With recent advances in computing, deep learning applications in health care are gaining momentum. Objective:
      
    

    
      This study aimed to leverage the information in clinical notes using deep neural networks (DNNs) to (1) improve the identification of patients treated for intentional self-harm and (2) predict future self-harm events. Methods:
      
    

    
      We extracted clinical text notes from electronic health records (EHRs) of 835 patients with International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for intentional self-harm and 1670 matched controls who never had any intentional self-harm ICD codes. The data were divided into training and holdout test sets. We tested a number of algorithms on clinical notes associated with the intentional self-harm codes using the training set, including several traditional bag-of-words-based models and 2 DNN models: a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a long short-term memory model. We also evaluated the predictive performance of the DNNs on a subset of patients who had clinical notes 1 to 6 months before the first intentional self-harm event. Finally, we evaluated the impact of a pretrained model using Word2vec (W2V) on performance. Results:
      
    

    
      The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the CNN on the phenotyping task, that is, the detection of intentional self-harm in clinical notes concurrent with the events was 0.999, with an F1 score of 0.985. In the predictive task, the CNN achieved the highest performance with an AUC of 0.882 and an F1 score of 0.769. Although pretraining with W2V shortened the DNN training time, it did not improve performance. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The strong performance on the first task, namely, phenotyping based on clinical notes, suggests that such models could be used effectively for surveillance of intentional self-harm in clinical text in an EHR. The modest performance on the predictive task notwithstanding, the results using DNN models on clinical text alone are competitive with other reports in the literature using risk factors from structured EHR data.","['1 Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, United States.', '2 University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, United States.']","Jihad S Obeid, Jennifer Dahne, Sean Christensen, Samuel Howard, Tami Crawford, Lewis J Frey, Tracy Stecker, Brian E Bunnell, ",JMIR medical informatics,2020,"deep learning; electronic health records; machine learning; natural language processing; suicide; suicide, attempted.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32729840

      Less than 5% of patients with cancer enroll in clinical trials, and 1 in 5 trials are stopped for poor accrual. We evaluated an automated clinical trial matching system that uses natural language processing to extract patient and trial characteristics from unstructured sources and machine learning to match patients to clinical trials. Patients and methods:
      
    

    
      Medical records from 997 patients with breast cancer were assessed for trial eligibility at Highlands Oncology Group between May and August 2016. System and manual attribute extraction and eligibility determinations were compared using the percentage of agreement for 239 patients and 4 trials. Sensitivity and specificity of system-generated eligibility determinations were measured, and the time required for manual review and system-assisted eligibility determinations were compared. Results:
      
    

    
      Agreement between system and manual attribute extraction ranged from 64.3% to 94.0%. Agreement between system and manual eligibility determinations was 81%-96%. System eligibility determinations demonstrated specificities between 76% and 99%, with sensitivities between 91% and 95% for 3 trials and 46.7% for the 4th. Manual eligibility screening of 90 patients for 3 trials took 110 minutes; system-assisted eligibility determinations of the same patients for the same trials required 24 minutes. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      In this study, the clinical trial matching system displayed a promising performance in screening patients with breast cancer for trial eligibility. System-assisted trial eligibility determinations were substantially faster than manual review, and the system reliably excluded ineligible patients for all trials and identified eligible patients for most trials.","['1 Research Department, Highlands Oncology Group, Fayetteville, AR.', '2 IBM Watson Health, IBM Corporation, Cambridge, MA.', '3 RxEconomics, Hunt Valley, MD.', '4 Highlands Oncology Group, Rogers, AR.', '5 US Oncology Medical, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, NJ.']","J Thaddeus Beck, Melissa Rammage, Gretchen P Jackson, Anita M Preininger, Irene Dankwa-Mullan, M Christopher Roebuck, Adam Torres, Helen Holtzen, Sadie E Coverdill, M Paul Williamson, Quincy Chau, Kyu Rhee, Michael Vinegra, ",JCO clinical cancer informatics,2020 Jan,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31977254
1185,The Role of Eye Gaze During Natural Social Interactions in Typical and Autistic People,"Social interactions involve complex exchanges of a variety of social signals, such as gaze, facial expressions, speech and gestures. Focusing on the dual function of eye gaze, this review explores how the presence of an audience, communicative purpose and temporal dynamics of gaze allow interacting partners to achieve successful communication. First, we focus on how being watched modulates social cognition and behavior. We then show that the study of interpersonal gaze processing, particularly gaze temporal dynamics, can provide valuable understanding of social behavior in real interactions. We propose that the Interpersonal Gaze Processing model, which combines both sensing and signaling functions of eye gaze, provides a framework to make sense of gaze patterns in live interactions. Finally, we discuss how autistic individuals process the belief in being watched and interpersonal dynamics of gaze, and suggest that systematic manipulation of factors modulating gaze signaling can reveal which aspects of social eye gaze are challenging in autism.","['1 Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London, London, United Kingdom.']","Roser Cañigueral, Antonia F de C Hamilton, ",Frontiers in psychology,2019,audience effect; autism; eye gaze; interpersonal dynamics; social interaction.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30930822
1186,Modeling of Brain-Like Concept Coding with Adulthood Neurogenesis in the Dentate Gyrus,"Mammalian brains respond to new concepts via a type of neural coding termed ""concept coding."" During concept coding, the dentate gyrus (DG) plays a vital role in pattern separation and pattern integration of concepts because it is a brain region with substantial neurogenesis in adult mammals. Although concept coding properties of the brain have been extensively studied by experimental work, modeling of the process to guide both further experimental studies and applications such as natural language processing is scarce. To model brain-like concept coding, we built a spiking neural network inspired by adulthood neurogenesis in the DG. Our model suggests that neurogenesis may facilitate integration of closely related concepts and separation of less relevant concepts. Such pattern agrees with the previous experimental observations in classification tasks and place cells in the hippocampus. Therefore, our simulation provides insight for future experimental studies on the neural coding difference between perception and cognition. By presenting 14 contexts each containing 4 concepts to the network, we found that neural responses of the DG changed dynamically as the context repetition time increased and were eventually consistent with the category organization of humans. Thus, our work provides a new framework of word representation for the construction of brain-like knowledge map.","['1 Neuroscience and Intelligent Media Institute, Communication University of China, Beijing 100024, China.', '2 State Key Laboratory of Mathematical Engineering and Advanced Computing, Wuxi 214125, China.', '3 Pacific Northwest Research Institute, Seattle, WA 98122, USA.']","Ye Wang, Yan Gao, Yaling Deng, Lei Yang, ",Computational intelligence and neuroscience,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31814816

The enriched Gene Ontology terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways were obtained using DAVID (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/). A protein-protein interaction network was constructed using the STRING database. Hub genes were identified as genes that interact with at least 10 other genes within the BAH-related gene network. In total, 138 BAH-associated genes were identified as significant (P < 0.05), and 133 pathways were identified as significant (P < 0.05, false discovery rate < 0.05). A BAH-related protein network that included 81 interactions was constructed. Twenty genes were determined to interact with at least 10 others (P < 0.05, false discovery rate < 0.05) and were identified as the BAH-related hub genes of this protein-protein interaction network.

      The aim of this study was to compare breast imaging subspecialists' follow-up recommendations for incidental liver lesions (ILLs) on breast MRI with abdominal subspecialty radiologists' opinions informed by best-practice recommendations. Methods:
      
    

    
      In this retrospective study at an academic medical center, natural language processing identified reports with ILLs among 2,181 breast MRI studies completed in 2015. Electronic health record and radiology report reviews abstracted malignancy presence or absence, prior imaging, and breast subspecialists' recommendations regarding ILLs for random sets of 30 patients: ILLs with follow-up recommendations, ILLs without recommendations, and without ILLs. Two abdominal radiologists evaluated MRI liver findings and offered follow-up recommendations in consensus. The primary outcome was agreement between breast and abdominal subspecialists in patients with ILL follow-up recommendations compared with those without (χ2 analysis). Secondary outcomes were agreement between subspecialists when ILLs were reported and referring clinicians' adherence to follow-up recommendations. Results:
      
    

    
      ILLs were identified in 11.3% of breast MRI reports (247 of 2,181); breast subspecialists made follow-up recommendations in 12% of them (30 of 247). Abdominal subspecialists agreed with breast subspecialists when ILLs required no follow-up (29 of 30 cases) but disagreed with 28 of 30 breast subspecialists' follow-up recommendations (agreement proportion 29 of 30 versus 2 of 30, P < .0001). Subspecialists agreed in 93% of cases (28 of 30) when breast imagers reported no ILLs. Overall, 16 of 30 breast subspecialists' follow-up recommendations were performed; ILLs were benign in 15. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Abdominal subspecialists disagreed frequently with breast subspecialists regarding follow-up recommendations for ILLs on breast MRI.

1192,FP2VEC: a new molecular featurizer for learning molecular properties,"Motivation:
      
    

    
      One of the most successful methods for predicting the properties of chemical compounds is the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) methods. The prediction accuracy of QSAR models has recently been greatly improved by employing deep learning technology. Especially, newly developed molecular featurizers based on graph convolution operations on molecular graphs significantly outperform the conventional extended connectivity fingerprints (ECFP) feature in both classification and regression tasks, indicating that it is critical to develop more effective new featurizers to fully realize the power of deep learning techniques. Motivated by the fact that there is a clear analogy between chemical compounds and natural languages, this work develops a new molecular featurizer, FP2VEC, which represents a chemical compound as a set of trainable embedding vectors. Results:
      
    

    
      To implement and test our new featurizer, we build a QSAR model using a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that has been successfully used for natural language processing tasks such as sentence classification task. By testing our new method on several benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the combination of FP2VEC and CNN model can achieve competitive results in many QSAR tasks, especially in classification tasks. We also demonstrate that the FP2VEC model is especially effective for multitask learning. Availability and implementation:

1193,Artificial intelligence-enabled healthcare delivery,"In recent years, there has been massive progress in artificial intelligence (AI) with the development of deep neural networks, natural language processing, computer vision and robotics. These techniques are now actively being applied in healthcare with many of the health service activities currently being delivered by clinicians and administrators predicted to be taken over by AI in the coming years. However, there has also been exceptional hype about the abilities of AI with a mistaken notion that AI will replace human clinicians altogether. These perspectives are inaccurate, and if a balanced perspective of the limitations and promise of AI is taken, one can gauge which parts of the health system AI can be integrated to make a meaningful impact. The four main areas where AI would have the most influence would be: patient administration, clinical decision support, patient monitoring and healthcare interventions. This health system where AI plays a central role could be termed an AI-enabled or AI-augmented health system. In this article, we discuss how this system can be developed based on a realistic assessment of current AI technologies and predicted developments.","['1 1 School of Medicine, Deakin University, Victoria 3220, Australia.', '2 2 Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 3PJ, UK.', '3 3 Long School of Medicine, UT Health San Antonio, TX 78229, USA.']","Sandeep Reddy, John Fox, Maulik P Purohit, ",Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine,2019 Jan,Health service research; health policy; other public health.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30507284
1194,Bridging worldviews: Toward a common model of leadership across the health professions,"Background:
      
    

    
      As the pace of health sector transformation accelerates, the importance of leadership continues to grow across all health professions. Advances in a variety of disciplines can inform effective leadership development. However, at present, most health sector leadership competency models do not incorporate these advances and are instead developed using consensus-based methods within specific professions. An interprofessional approach to leadership competencies could help incorporate these advances and support better interdisciplinary leadership development. Purpose:
      
    

    
      This study was pursued to revise and revalidate a widely used health sector leadership competency model and assess its potential for providing greater interoperability across the professions. Methodology/approach:
      
    

    
      Using the National Center for Healthcare Leadership's interprofessional competency model Version 2.1 as the starting point, we developed a revised and revalidated model in four phases: (a) we completed a future scan using methods described in Garman et al. [Garman, A. N., Johnson, T. J., & Royer, T. (2011). The future of healthcare: Global trends worth watching. Chicago, IL: Health Administration Press.]; (b) we collected behavioral event interview data from pairs of leaders representing different organizational and performance levels, using methods developed by Boyatzis [Boyatzis, R. E. (1982). The competent manager: A model for effective performance. New York, NY: John Wiley & Sons.]; (c) we conducted a validity study via electronic survey of 145 working managers and calculated content validity ratios using methods described by Lawshe [Lawshe, C. H. (1975). A quantitative approach to content validity. Personnel Psychology, 38(4), 563-575.]; and (d) we used natural language processing to assess the extent to which existing leadership models in the health professions will crosswalk to the new model. Findings:
      
    

    
      All competencies in the revised model successfully met criteria for validity. The revised model also successfully crosswalked against, on average, 85% of the competencies in the other five health professions leadership models. Practice implications:
      
    

    
      Based on the results of this research, we conclude the revised model can provide a ""common language"" framework in support of interdisciplinary leadership development. The availability of such a model may also assist human resource and development executives in better aligning learning resources with organizational goals.","['1 Andrew N.

1195,Negative Patient-Experience Comments After Total Shoulder Arthroplasty,"Background:
      
    

    
      There is growing interest in enhancing the patient experience after discretionary orthopaedic surgery. Patient narratives are a potentially valuable but largely unscrutinized source of information. Using machine learning to understand sentiment within patient-experience comments, we explored the content of negative comments after total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA), their associated factors, and their relationship with traditional measures of patient satisfaction and with perioperative outcomes. Methods:
      
    

    
      An institutional registry was used to link the records of 186 patients who had undergone elective primary TSA between 2016 and 2017 with vendor-supplied patient satisfaction data, which included patient comments and the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey. Using a machine-learning-based natural language processing approach, all patient comments were mined for sentiment and classified as positive, negative, mixed, or neutral. Negative comments were further classified into themes. Multivariable logistic regression was employed to determine characteristics associated with providing a negative comment. Results:
      
    

    
      Most patients (71%) provided at least 1 comment; 32% of the comments were negative, 62% were positive, 5% were mixed, and 1% were neutral. The themes of the negative comments were room condition (27%), time management (17%), inefficient communication (13%), lack of compassion (12%), difficult intravenous (IV) insertion (10%), food (10%), medication side effects (6%), discharge instructions (4%), and pain management (2%). Women and sicker patients were more likely to provide negative comments. Patients who made negative comments were more likely to be dissatisfied with overall hospital care and with pain management (2 HCAHPS core items), but there were no differences in any of the studied outcomes (peak pain intensity, opioid intake, operative time, hospital length of stay, discharge disposition, or 1-year American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons [ASES] score) between those who provided negative comments and those who did not. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Patient-narrative analysis can shed light on the aspects of the process of care that are most critiqued by patients. While patient satisfaction may not be a surrogate for effectiveness of care or functional outcomes, efforts to improve the hospital environment, enhance nontechnical skills, and reduce unnecessary delays are important in providing high-quality, patient-centered care after TSA.","['1 Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, New England Baptist Hospital, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.', '2 Boston Sports and Shoulder Center, Waltham, Massachusetts.', '3 Department of Surgery and Perioperative Care, Dell Medical School at the University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas.']","Mariano E Menendez, Jonathan Shaker, Sarah M Lawler, David Ring, Andrew Jawa, ",The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

1196,"Digital conversations about suicide among teenagers and adults with epilepsy: A big-data, machine learning analysis","Objective:
      
    

    
      Digital media conversations can provide important insight into the concerns and struggles of people with epilepsy (PWE) outside of formal clinical settings and help generate useful information for treatment planning. Our study aimed to explore the big data from open-source digital conversations among PWE with regard to suicidality, specifically comparing teenagers and adults, using machine learning technology. Methods:
      
    

    
      Advanced machine-learning empowered methodology was used to mine and structure open-source digital conversations of self-identifying teenagers and adults who endorsed suffering from epilepsy and engaged in conversation about suicide. The search was limited to 12 months and included only conversations originating from US internet protocol (IP) addresses. Natural language processing and text analytics were employed to develop a thematic analysis. Results:
      
    

    
      A total of 222 000 unique conversations about epilepsy, including 9000 (4%) related to suicide, were posted during the study period. The suicide-related conversations were posted by 7.8% of teenagers and 3.2% of adults in the study. Several critical differences were noted between teenagers and adults. A higher percentage of teenagers are: fearful of ""the unknown"" due to seizures (63% vs 12% adults), concerned about social consequences of seizures (30% vs 21%), and seek emotional support (29% vs 19%). In contrast, a significantly higher percentage of adults show a defeatist (""given up"") attitude compared to teenagers (42% vs 4%). There were important differences in the author's determined sentiments behind the conversations among teenagers and adults. Significance:
      
    

    
      In this first of its kind big data analysis of nearly a quarter-million digital conversations about epilepsy using machine learning, we found that teenagers engage in an online conversation about suicide more often than adults. There are some key differences in the attitudes and concerns, which may have implications for the treatment of younger patients with epilepsy.","['1 Department of Psychiatry/Epilepsy, Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine, Cleveland, OH, USA.', '2 Department of Neuroscience, Johnson and Johnson, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', '3 Cultureintel™ Inc., New York City, NY, USA.', '4 Begun Center for Violence Prevention Research and Education, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.']","Tatiana Falcone, Anjali Dagar, Ruby C Castilla-Puentes, Amit Anand, Caroline Brethenoux, Liliana G Valleta, Patrick Furey, Jane Timmons-Mitchell, Elia Pestana-Knight, ",Epilepsia,2020 May,big data; epilepsy; machine learning; social media; suicide; teenagers.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32383797
1197,Developing and Testing Automatic Models of Patient Communicative Health Literacy Using Linguistic Features: Findings from the ECLIPPSE study,"Patients with diabetes and limited health literacy (HL) may have suboptimal communication exchange with their health care providers and be at elevated risk of adverse health outcomes. These difficulties are generally attributed to patients' reduced ability to both communicate and understand health-related ideas as well as physicians' lack of skill in identifying those with limited HL. Understanding and identifying patients with barriers posed by lower HL to improve healthcare delivery and outcomes is an important research avenue. However, doing so using traditional methods has proven difficult and infeasible to scale. This study using corpus analyses, expert human ratings of HL, and natural language processing (NLP) approaches to estimate HL at the individual patient level. The goal of the study is to better understand HL from a linguistic perspective and to open new research areas to enhance population management and individualized care. Specifically, this study examines HL as a function of patients' demonstrated ability to communicate health-related information to their providers via secure messages. The study develops an NLP-based HL model and validates the model by predicting patient-related events such as medical outcomes and hospitalizations. Results indicate that the developed model predicts human ratings of HL with ~80% accuracy. Validation indicates that lower HL patients are more likely to be nonwhite and have lower educational attainment. In addition, patients with lower HL suffered more negative health outcomes and had higher healthcare service utilization.","['1 Department of Applied Linguistics, Georgia State University.', '2 Department of Psychology, Arizona State University.', '3 Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California.', '4 School of Medicine, University of California.']","Scott A Crossley, Renu Balyan, Jennifer Liu, Andrew J Karter, Danielle McNamara, Dean Schillinger, ",Health communication,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32114833

LSTM neural networks have recently achieved remarkable recent in the field of natural language processing (NLP) because they are well suited for learning from experience to predict time series. For this purpose, we propose an empirical mode decomposition (EMD)-based long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network model for predicting short-term metro inbound passenger flow. The EMD algorithm decomposes the original sequential passenger flow into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and a residual. Selected IMFs that are strongly correlated with the original data can be obtained via feature selection. The selected IMFs and the original data are integrated into inputs for LSTM neural networks, and a single LSTM prediction model and an EMD-LSTM hybrid forecasting model are developed. Finally, historical real automatic fare collection (AFC) data from metro passengers are collected from Chengdu Metro to verify the validity of the proposed EMD-LSTM prediction model. The results indicate that the proposed EMD-LSTM hybrid forecasting model outperforms the LSTM, ARIMA and BPN models.","['1 School of Transportation and Logistics, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China.', '2 National Railway Train Diagram Research and Training Center, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China.', '3 National and Local Joint Engineering Laboratory of Comprehensive Intelligent Transportation, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China.']","Quanchao Chen, Di Wen, Xuqiang Li, Dingjun Chen, Hongxia Lv, Jie Zhang, Peng Gao, ",PloS one,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31509599

      Mammoplasty removes random samples of breast tissue from asymptomatic women providing a unique method for evaluating background prevalence of breast pathology in normal population. Our goal was to identify the rate of atypical breast lesions and cancers in women of various ages in the largest mammoplasty cohort reported to date. Methods:
      
    

    
      We analyzed pathologic reports from patients undergoing bilateral mammoplasty, using natural language processing algorithm, verified by human review. Patients with a prior history of breast cancer or atypia were excluded. Results:
      
    

    
      A total of 4775 patients were deemed eligible. Median age was 40 (range 13-86) and was higher in patients with any incidental finding compared to patients with normal reports (52 vs. 39 years, p = 0.0001). Pathological findings were detected in 7.06% (337) of procedures. Benign high-risk lesions were found in 299 patients (6.26%). Invasive carcinoma and ductal carcinoma in situ were detected in 15 (0.31%) and 23 (0.48%) patients, respectively. The rate of atypias and cancers increased with age. Conclusion:

However, online users post thousands of movie reviews on daily basis and it is hard for them to manually summarize the reviews. Movie review mining and summarization is one of the challenging tasks in natural language processing. Therefore, an automatic approach is desirable to summarize the lengthy movie reviews, and it will allow users to quickly recognize the positive and negative aspects of a movie. This study employs a feature extraction technique called bag of words (BoW) to extract features from movie reviews and represent the reviews as a vector space model or feature vector. The next phase uses Naïve Bayes machine learning algorithm to classify the movie reviews (represented as feature vector) into positive and negative. Next, an undirected weighted graph is constructed from the pairwise semantic similarities between classified review sentences in such a way that the graph nodes represent review sentences, while the edges of graph indicate semantic similarity weight. The weighted graph-based ranking algorithm (WGRA) is applied to compute the rank score for each review sentence in the graph. Finally, the top ranked sentences (graph nodes) are chosen based on highest rank scores to produce the extractive summary. Experimental results reveal that the proposed approach is superior to other state-of-the-art approaches.","['1 Department of Computer Science, Islamia College University Peshawar, Peshawar 25000, KP, Pakistan.', '2 Tecnologico de Monterrey, Escuela de Ingenieria y Ciencias, Zapopan, Jalisco 45138, Mexico.', '3 Department of Computer Science, Abbottabad University of Science and Technology, Abbottabad 25000, Pakistan.', '4 Department of Information Technology, University of Haripur, Haripur, KP, Pakistan.', '5 School of Computing, Faculty of Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Johor Bahru, Malaysia.']","Atif Khan, Muhammad Adnan Gul, Mahdi Zareei, R R Biswal, Asim Zeb, Muhammad Naeem, Yousaf Saeed, Naomie Salim, ",Computational intelligence and neuroscience,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32565772

In this paper, we explore the correlations in the weight matrices, and approximate the weight matrices with the low-rank block-term tensors. We name the new corresponding structure as block-term tensor layers (BT-layers), which can be easily adapted to neural network models, such as CNNs and RNNs. In particular, the inputs and the outputs in BT-layers are reshaped into low-dimensional high-order tensors with a similar or improved representation power. Sufficient experiments have demonstrated that BT-layers in CNNs and RNNs can achieve a very large compression ratio on the number of parameters while preserving or improving the representation power of the original DNNs.","['1 SMILE Lab, School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu 610031, China.', '2 Center for Quantum Software and Information, University of Technology Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.', '3 Ping An Life Insurance Company of China, Ltd., China.', '4 Department of Computer Science, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, 84112 Utah, USA.', '5 School of Computer Science and Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 510085 Guangdong, China; Center for Artificial Intelligence, Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, 510085 Guangdong, China; SMILE Lab, School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu 610031, China.

With a renewed interest in quantifying creative processes facilitated by recent advances in neuroimaging technology, musical improvisation has emerged as an ideal paradigm to study creativity. However, many studies isolate the top-down processes related to creativity from those related to production and auditory perception, leaving the question of how creative behaviours integrate sensory information with higher cognitive processes unanswered. The bottom-up neural correlates of music perception have been extensively quantified, comprising networks for auditory processing and parsing semantic and syntactic content. In studies of spontaneously generated music and domain-general creativity, executive control and goal-directed movement networks are added to the perceptual foundation. This review summarises previous work on music perception and improvisation and presents a conceptual model of musical improvisation with known neural correlates. We make recommendations on future directions for the study of improvisation and discuss the challenges posed by this endeavour.","['1 Baycrest Centre, Rotman Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']","Sarah E M Faber, Anthony R McIntosh, ",The European journal of neuroscience,2020 Feb,creativity; language; music; neuroimaging; social interaction.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31482586
1205,"Are figurative interpretations of idioms directly retrieved, compositionally built, or both? Evidence from eye movement measures of reading","Idioms are part of a general class of multiword expressions where the overall interpretation cannot be fully determined through a simple syntactic and semantic (i.e., compositional) analysis of their component words (e.g., kick the bucket, save your skin). Idioms are thus simultaneously amenable to direct retrieval from memory, and to an on-demand compositional analysis, yet it is unclear which processes lead to figurative interpretations of idioms during comprehension. In this eye-tracking study, healthy adults read sentences in their native language that contained idioms, which were followed by figurative- or literal-biased disambiguating sentential information. The results showed that the earliest stages of comprehension are driven by direct retrieval of idiomatic forms; however, later stages of comprehension, after which point the intended meaning of an idiom is known, are driven by both direct retrieval and compositional processing. Of note, at later stages, increased idiom decomposability slowed reading time, suggesting more effortful figurative comprehension. Together, these results are most consistent with multidetermined or hybrid models of idiom processing.

1207,Predicting Inpatient Falls Using Natural Language Processing of Nursing Records Obtained From Japanese Electronic Medical Records: Case-Control Study,"Background:
      
    

    
      Falls in hospitals are the most common risk factor that affects the safety of inpatients and can result in severe harm. Therefore, preventing falls is one of the most important areas of risk management for health care organizations. However, existing methods for predicting falls are laborious and costly. Objective:
      
    

    
      The objective of this study is to verify whether hospital inpatient falls can be predicted through the analysis of a single input-unstructured nursing records obtained from Japanese electronic medical records (EMRs)-using a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm and machine learning. Methods:
      
    

    
      The nursing records of 335 fallers and 408 nonfallers for a 12-month period were extracted from the EMRs of an acute care hospital and randomly divided into a learning data set and test data set. The former data set was subjected to NLP and machine learning to extract morphemes that contributed to separating fallers from nonfallers to construct a model for predicting falls. Then, the latter data set was used to determine the predictive value of the model using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results:
      
    

    
      The prediction of falls using the test data set showed high accuracy, with an area under the ROC curve, sensitivity, specificity, and odds ratio of mean 0.834 (SD 0.005), mean 0.769 (SD 0.013), mean 0.785 (SD 0.020), and mean 12.27 (SD 1.11) for five independent experiments, respectively. The morphemes incorporated into the final model included many words closely related to known risk factors for falls, such as the use of psychotropic drugs, state of consciousness, and mobility, thereby demonstrating that an NLP algorithm combined with machine learning can effectively extract risk factors for falls from nursing records. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We successfully established that falls among hospital inpatients can be predicted by analyzing nursing records using an NLP algorithm and machine learning. Therefore, it may be possible to develop a fall risk monitoring system that analyzes nursing records daily and alerts health care professionals when the fall risk of an inpatient is increased.","['1 NTT Medical Center Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', '2 Pharmaceutical Research Department, Global Pharmaceutical R&D Division, Neopharma Japan Co Ltd, Tokyo, Japan.', '3 Research Development Department, Lifescience AI Business Division, FRONTEO Inc, Tokyo, Japan.', '4 Tokyo Healthcare University, Tokyo, Japan.']","Hayao Nakatani, Masatoshi Nakao, Hidefumi Uchiyama, Hiroyoshi Toyoshiba, Chikayuki Ochiai, ",JMIR medical informatics,2020,fall; machine learning; natural language processing; nursing record; prediction; risk factor.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32319959
1208,The relationships between oral language and reading instruction: Evidence from a computational model of reading,"Reading acquisition involves learning to associate visual symbols with spoken language. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that instruction on the relationship between spellings and sounds may be particularly important.However, it is unclear whether the effectiveness of this form of instruction depends on pre-existing oral language knowledge.To investigate this issue, we developed a series of computational models of reading incorporating orthographic, phonological and semantic processing to simulate bothartificialand natural orthographic learning conditions in adults and children. We exposed the models to instruction focused on spelling-sound or spelling-meaning relationships, and tested the influence of the models' oral language proficiency on the effectiveness of these training regimes. Overall, the simulations indicated thatoral language proficiency is a vital foundation for reading acquisition, and may modulate the effectiveness of reading instruction. These results provide a computational basis for the Simple View of Reading,and emphasise the importance of both oral language knowledge and spelling-sound instructionin the initial stages of learning to read.","['1 Department of Psychology, Lancaster University, UK; MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, University of Cambridge, UK.

1209,Natural Language Processing Combined with ICD-9-CM Codes as a Novel Method to Study the Epidemiology of Allergic Drug Reactions,"Background:
      
    

    
      Allergic drug reaction epidemiologic data are sparse because it remains difficult to identify true cases in large data sets using manual chart review. Objective:
      
    

    
      To develop and validate a novel informatics method based on natural language processing (NLP) in combination with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes that identifies allergic drug reactions in the electronic health record. Methods:
      
    

    
      Previously studied and high-yield ICD-9-CM codes were used to screen for possible allergic drug reactions among all inpatients admitted in 2007 and 2008. A random sample was selected for manual chart review to identify true cases of allergic drug reactions. A rule-based NLP algorithm was then developed to identify allergic drug reactions using free-text clinical notes and discharge summaries from the filtered cases. The performance of using manual chart review of ICD-9-CM codes alone was compared with ICD-9-CM codes in combination with NLP. Results:
      
    

    
      Of 3907 cases identified by ICD-9-CM codes, 725 (19%) were randomly selected for manual chart review; 335 were confirmed as allergic drug reactions, resulting in a positive predictive value (PPV) of 46% (range: 18%-79%) when using ICD-9-CM codes alone. Our NLP algorithm in combination with ICD-9-CM codes achieved a PPV of 86% (range: 69%-100%). Among the 335 confirmed positive cases, NLP identified 259 true cases, resulting in a recall/sensitivity of 77% (range: 26%-100%). Among the 390 negative cases, NLP achieved a specificity of 89% (range: 69%-100%). Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Using NLP with ICD-9-CM codes improved identification of allergic drug reactions. The resulting decrease in manual chart review effort will facilitate large epidemiology studies of this understudied area.","['1 Division of Rheumatology, Allergy, and Immunology, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Mass; Harvard Medical School, Boston, Mass.

1210,Constructing knowledge graphs and their biomedical applications,"Knowledge graphs can support many biomedical applications. These graphs represent biomedical concepts and relationships in the form of nodes and edges. In this review, we discuss how these graphs are constructed and applied with a particular focus on how machine learning approaches are changing these processes. Biomedical knowledge graphs have often been constructed by integrating databases that were populated by experts via manual curation, but we are now seeing a more robust use of automated systems. A number of techniques are used to represent knowledge graphs, but often machine learning methods are used to construct a low-dimensional representation that can support many different applications. This representation is designed to preserve a knowledge graph's local and/or global structure. Additional machine learning methods can be applied to this representation to make predictions within genomic, pharmaceutical, and clinical domains. We frame our discussion first around knowledge graph construction and then around unifying representational learning techniques and unifying applications. Advances in machine learning for biomedicine are creating new opportunities across many domains, and we note potential avenues for future work with knowledge graphs that appear particularly promising.","['1 Department of Systems Pharmacology and Translational Therapeutics, University of Pennsylvania, United States.', ""2 Department of Systems Pharmacology and Translational Therapeutics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Childhood Cancer Data Lab, Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation, United States.""]","David N Nicholson, Casey S Greene, ",Computational and structural biotechnology journal,2020,Lterature review; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Network embeddings; Text mining; knowledge graphs.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32637040
1211,"""A patient like me"" - An algorithm-based program to inform patients on the likely conditions people with symptoms like theirs have","To date, consumer health tools available over the web suffer from serious limitations that lead to low quality health- related information. While health data in our world are abundant, access to it is limited because of liability and privacy constraints.The objective of the present study was to develop and evaluate an algorithm-based tool which aims at providing the public with reliable, data-driven information based and personalized information regarding their symptoms, to help them and their physicians to make better informed decisions, based on statistics describing ""people like you"", who have experienced similar symptoms.We studied anonymized medical records of Maccabi Health Care. The data were analyzed by employing machine learning methodology and Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools. The NLP tools were developed to extract information from unstructured free-text written by Maccabi's physicians.Using machine learning and NLP on over 670 million notes of patients' visits with Maccabi physicians accrued since 1993, we developed predictors for medical conditions based on patterns of symptoms and personal characteristics.The algorithm was launched for Maccabi insured members on January 7, 2018 and for members of Integrity Family Care program in Alabama on May 1, 2018.The App. invites the user to describe her/ his main symptom or several symptoms, and this prompts a series of questions along the path developed by the algorithm, based on the analysis of 70 million patients' visits to their physicians.Users started dialogues with 225 different types of symptoms, answering on average 22 questions before seeing how people similar to them were diagnosed. Users usually described between 3 and 4 symptoms (mean 3.2) in the health dialogue.In response to the question ""conditions verified by your doctor"", 82.4% of responders (895/1085) in Maccabi reported that the diagnoses suggested by K's health dialogues were in agreement with their doctor's final diagnosis. In Integrity Health Services, 85.4% of responders (111/130) were in agreement with the physicians' diagnosis.While the program achieves very high approval rates by its users, its primary achievement is the 85% accuracy in identifying the most likely diagnosis, with the gold standard being the final diagnosis made by the personal physician in each individual case. Moreover, the machine learning algorithm continues to update itself with the feedback given by users.","['1 Maccabi-Kahn Institute of Research and Innovation.', '2 Sackler School of Medicine Tel Aviv University.', '3 Ariel University, Israel.', '4 K Health, New York, NY.', '5 Integrity Family Care, Huntsville Alabama.']","Gideon Koren, Daniel Souroujon, Ran Shaul, Allon Bloch, Ariel Leventhal, Jason Lockett, Varda Shalev, ",Medicine,2019 Oct,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31626135
1212,≥3 Nonadvanced Adenomas are More Common in the Era of Contemporary Colonoscopy and Not Associated With Metachronous Advanced Neoplasia,"Introduction:
      
    

    
      Data from standard definition colonoscopy era demonstrate patients with an advanced adenoma (≥10 mm, villous features or high-grade dysplasia) or ≥3 nonadvanced adenomas are considered high-risk for metachronous advanced neoplasia (MAN). Low-risk adenoma (LRA) patients are those with 1 to 2, <10 mm tubular adenomas. High definition colonoscopy, split-dose bowel preparation, and attention to adenoma detection enhance diminutive adenoma detection. We compared baseline adenoma characteristics between patients undergoing colonoscopy in a historic cohort (HC) and contemporary cohort (CC) to determine if number of patients with ≥3 nonadvanced adenomas are increased in CC, and if those features are associated with MAN in CC. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      Patients undergoing their first colonoscopy in HC (<2006) and CC (≥2006) at age 50 and above were identified through natural language processing. Multivariable regression analysis compared baseline adenoma characteristics between HC and CC, and determined the association between baseline characteristics and MAN in CC patients. Results:
      
    

    
      In total, 255,074 colonoscopies were performed between 1990 and 2015. A total of 9773 colonoscopies performed in the HC and 59,531 in the CC were included. At baseline, CC patients were more likely to have ≥3 nonadvanced adenomas [odds ratio (OR): 2.1, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.7-2.6]. In 3,377 CC patients undergoing follow-up colonoscopy, the risk of MAN did not differ between patients with LRA versus those with ≥3 nonadvanced adenomas (6.3% vs. 4.6%, OR: 1.4, CI: 0.58-3.5) including 3-4 (6.1%, OR: 1.4, CI: 0.52-3.6) and ≥5 (7.7%, OR: 1.8, CI: 0.23-14.6), although few patients had ≥5 nonadvanced adenomas. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Colonoscopy in the contemporary era increases detection of patients with ≥3 nonadvanced adenomas, which do not increase the risk of MAN compared with LRA patients. A similar surveillance to LRA patients should be considered for those patients.","['1 Departments of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition.', '2 Center for Population Health Research and Quantitative Health Sciences.', '3 General Surgery, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.']","Carol Rouphael, Rocio Lopez, John McMichael, Carol A Burke, ",Journal of clinical gastroenterology,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32427796
1213,Factors Associated With Optimal Follow-up in Women With BI-RADS 3 Breast Findings,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Assess rate of and factors associated with optimal follow-up in patients with BI-RADS 3 breast findings. Methods:
      
    

    
      This Institutional Review Board-approved, retrospective cohort study, performed at an academic medical center, included all women undergoing breast imaging (ultrasound and mammography) in 2016. Index reports for unique patients with an assessment of BI-RADS 3 (retrieved via natural language processing) comprised the study population. Patient-specific and provider-related features were extracted from the Research Data Warehouse. The Institutional Cancer Registry identified patients diagnosed with breast cancer. Optimal follow-up rate was calculated as patients with follow-up imaging on the same breast 3 to 9 months from the index examination among patients with BI-RADS 3 assessments. Univariate analysis and multivariable logistic regression determined features associated with optimal follow-up. Malignancy rate and time to malignancy detection were recorded. Results:
      
    

    
      Among 93,685 breast imaging examinations, 64,771 were from unique patients of which 2,967 had BI-RADS 3 findings (4.6%). Excluding patients with off-site index examinations and those with another breast examination <3 months from the index, 1,125 of 1,511 patients (74%) had optimal follow-up. In univariate and multivariable analysis, prior breast cancer was associated with optimal follow-up; younger age, Hispanic ethnicity, divorced status, and lack of insurance were associated with not having optimal follow-up. Malignancy rate was 0.86%, and mean time to detection was 330 days. Discussion:
      
    

    
      Follow-up of BI-RADS 3 breast imaging findings is optimal in only 74% of women. Further interventions to promote follow-up should target younger, unmarried women, those with Hispanic ethnicity, and women without history of breast cancer and without insurance coverage.","[""1 Center for Evidence-Based Imaging, Department of Radiology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts; Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.

1214,Drug vector representation: a tool for drug similarity analysis,"DrugMatrix is a valuable toxicogenomic dataset, which provides in vivo transcriptome data corresponding to hundreds of chemical drugs. However, the relationships between drugs and how those drugs affect the biological process are still unknown. The high dimensionality of the microarray data hinders its application. The aims of this study are to (1) represent the transcriptome data by lower-dimensional vectors, (2) compare drug similarity, (3) represent drug combinations by adding vectors and (4) infer drug mechanism of action (MoA) and genotoxicity features. We borrowed the latent semantic analysis (LSA) technique from natural language processing to represent treatments (drugs with multiple concentrations and time points) by dense vectors, each dimension of which is an orthogonal biological feature. The gProfiler enrichment tool was used for the 100-dimensional vector feature annotation. The similarity between treatments vectors was calculated by the cosine function. Adding vectors may represent drug combinations, treatment times or treatment doses that are not presented in the original data. Drug-drug interaction pairs had a higher similarity than random drug pairs in the hepatocyte data. The vector features helped to reveal the MoA. Differential feature expression was also implicated for genotoxic and non-genotoxic carcinogens. An easy-to-use Web tool was developed by Shiny Web application framework for the exploration of treatment similarities and drug combinations (https://bioinformatics.fafu.edu.cn/drugmatrix/). We represented treatments by vectors and provided a tool that is useful for hypothesis generation in toxicogenomic, such as drug similarity, drug repurposing, combination therapy and MoA.","[""1 School of Life Sciences, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, 350002, People's Republic of China."", ""2 School of Life Sciences, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, 350002, People's Republic of China. weilau@fafu.edu.cn.""]","Liping Lin, Luoyao Wan, Huaqin He, Wei Liu, ",Molecular genetics and genomics : MGG,2020 Jul,Carcinogen; Drug combinations; Drug cosine similarity; DrugMatrix; Genotoxic; Mechanism of action (MoA).,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32222838
1215,FasTag: Automatic text classification of unstructured medical narratives,"Unstructured clinical narratives are continuously being recorded as part of delivery of care in electronic health records, and dedicated tagging staff spend considerable effort manually assigning clinical codes for billing purposes. Despite these efforts, however, label availability and accuracy are both suboptimal. In this retrospective study, we aimed to automate the assignment of top-level International Classification of Diseases version 9 (ICD-9) codes to clinical records from human and veterinary data stores using minimal manual labor and feature curation. Automating top-level annotations could in turn enable rapid cohort identification, especially in a veterinary setting. To this end, we trained long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on 52,722 human and 89,591 veterinary records. We investigated the accuracy of both separate-domain and combined-domain models and probed model portability. We established relevant baseline classification performances by training Decision Trees (DT) and Random Forests (RF). We also investigated whether transforming the data using MetaMap Lite, a clinical natural language processing tool, affected classification performance. We showed that the LSTM-RNNs accurately classify veterinary and human text narratives into top-level categories with an average weighted macro F1 score of 0.74 and 0.68 respectively. In the ""neoplasia"" category, the model trained on veterinary data had a high validation accuracy in veterinary data and moderate accuracy in human data, with F1 scores of 0.91 and 0.70 respectively. Our LSTM method scored slightly higher than that of the DT and RF models. The use of LSTM-RNN models represents a scalable structure that could prove useful in cohort identification for comparative oncology studies. Digitization of human and veterinary health information will continue to be a reality, particularly in the form of unstructured narratives. Our approach is a step forward for these two domains to learn from and inform one another.","['1 Department of Biomedical Data Science, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America.', '2 Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America.', '3 Fauna Bio, San Francisco, CA, United States of America.', '4 Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, United States of America.', '5 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, United States of America.']","Guhan Ram Venkataraman, Arturo Lopez Pineda, Oliver J Bear Don't Walk Iv, Ashley M Zehnder, Sandeep Ayyar, Rodney L Page, Carlos D Bustamante, Manuel A Rivas, ",PloS one,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32569327

      Incomplete and static reaction picklists in the allergy module led to free-text and missing entries that inhibit the clinical decision support intended to prevent adverse drug reactions. We developed a novel, data-driven, ""dynamic"" reaction picklist to improve allergy documentation in the electronic health record (EHR). Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      We split 3 decades of allergy entries in the EHR of a large Massachusetts healthcare system into development and validation datasets. We consolidated duplicate allergens and those with the same ingredients or allergen groups. We created a reaction value set via expert review of a previously developed value set and then applied natural language processing to reconcile reactions from structured and free-text entries. Three association rule-mining measures were used to develop a comprehensive reaction picklist dynamically ranked by allergen. The dynamic picklist was assessed using recall at top k suggested reactions, comparing performance to the static picklist. Results:
      
    

    
      The modified reaction value set contained 490 reaction concepts. Among 4 234 327 allergy entries collected, 7463 unique consolidated allergens and 469 unique reactions were identified. Of the 3 dynamic reaction picklists developed, the 1 with the optimal ranking achieved recalls of 0.632, 0.763, and 0.822 at the top 5, 10, and 15, respectively, significantly outperforming the static reaction picklist ranked by reaction frequency. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The dynamic reaction picklist developed using EHR data and a statistical measure was superior to the static picklist and suggested proper reactions for allergy documentation.

1218,Combining Contextualized Embeddings and Prior Knowledge for Clinical Named Entity Recognition: Evaluation Study,"Background:
      
    

    
      Named entity recognition (NER) is a key step in clinical natural language processing (NLP). Traditionally, rule-based systems leverage prior knowledge to define rules to identify named entities. Recently, deep learning-based NER systems have become more and more popular. Contextualized word embedding, as a new type of representation of the word, has been proposed to dynamically capture word sense using context information and has proven successful in many deep learning-based systems in either general domain or medical domain. However, there are very few studies that investigate the effects of combining multiple contextualized embeddings and prior knowledge on the clinical NER task. Objective:
      
    

    
      This study aims to improve the performance of NER in clinical text by combining multiple contextual embeddings and prior knowledge. Methods:
      
    

    
      In this study, we investigate the effects of combining multiple contextualized word embeddings with classic word embedding in deep neural networks to predict named entities in clinical text. We also investigate whether using a semantic lexicon could further improve the performance of the clinical NER system. Results:
      
    

    
      By combining contextualized embeddings such as ELMo and Flair, our system achieves the F-1 score of 87.30% when only training based on a portion of the 2010 Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside NER task dataset. After incorporating the medical lexicon into the word embedding, the F-1 score was further increased to 87.44%. Another finding was that our system still could achieve an F-1 score of 85.36% when the size of the training data was reduced to 40%. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Combined contextualized embedding could be beneficial for the clinical NER task.

1219,PharmacoNER Tagger: a deep learning-based tool for automatically finding chemicals and drugs in Spanish medical texts,"Automatically detecting mentions of pharmaceutical drugs and chemical substances is key for the subsequent extraction of relations of chemicals with other biomedical entities such as genes, proteins, diseases, adverse reactions or symptoms. The identification of drug mentions is also a prior step for complex event types such as drug dosage recognition, duration of medical treatments or drug repurposing. Formally, this task is known as named entity recognition (NER), meaning automatically identifying mentions of predefined entities of interest in running text. In the domain of medical texts, for chemical entity recognition (CER), techniques based on hand-crafted rules and graph-based models can provide adequate performance. In the recent years, the field of natural language processing has mainly pivoted to deep learning and state-of-the-art results for most tasks involving natural language are usually obtained with artificial neural networks. Competitive resources for drug name recognition in English medical texts are already available and heavily used, while for other languages such as Spanish these tools, although clearly needed were missing. In this work, we adapt an existing neural NER system, NeuroNER, to the particular domain of Spanish clinical case texts, and extend the neural network to be able to take into account additional features apart from the plain text.

      A case-crossover study was conducted in a large mental health records database. A natural language processing tool was developed using regular expression matching to identify text occurring within quotation marks in the EHR. Setting:
      
    

    
      Electronic records from a large mental healthcare provider serving a geographic catchment of 1.3 million residents in South London were linked with hospitalisation data. Participants:
      
    

    
      1503 individuals were identified as having a hospitalised suicide attempt from 1 April 2006 to 31 March 2017 with at least one document in both the case period (1-30 days prior to admission) and the control period (61-90 days prior to admission). Outcome measures:
      
    

    
      The number of quoted phrases in the control as compared with the case period. Results:
      
    

    
      Both attended (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.08) and non-attended (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.26) clinical appointments were independently higher in the case compared with control period, while there was no difference in mental healthcare hospitalisation (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.01). In addition, there was no difference in the levels of quoted text between the comparison time periods (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.30). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      This study successfully developed an algorithm to identify quoted speech in text fields from routine mental healthcare records. Contrary to the hypothesis, no association between this exposure and proximity to a suicide attempt was found; however, further evaluation is warranted on the way in which clinician-perceived risk might be feasibly characterised from clinical text.","[""1 Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK lasantha.jayasinghe@kcl.ac.uk."", ""2 Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK."", '3 South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.']","Lasantha Jayasinghe, André Bittar, Rina Dutta, Robert Stewart, ",BMJ open,2020,health informatics; psychiatry; suicide & self-harm.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32327481
1222,Integrating questionnaire measures for transdiagnostic psychiatric phenotyping using word2vec,"Background:
      
    

    
      Recent initiatives in psychiatry emphasize the utility of characterizing psychiatric symptoms in a multidimensional manner. However, strategies for applying standard self-report scales for multiaxial assessment have not been well-studied, particularly where the aim is to support both categorical and dimensional phenotypes. Methods:
      
    

    
      We propose a method for applying natural language processing to derive dimensional measures of psychiatric symptoms from questionnaire data. We utilized nine self-report symptom measures drawn from a large cellular biobanking study that enrolled individuals with mood and psychotic disorders, as well as healthy controls. To summarize questionnaire results we used word embeddings, a technique to represent words as numeric vectors preserving semantic and syntactic meaning. A low-dimensional approximation to the embedding space was used to derive the proposed succinct summary of symptom profiles. To validate our embedding-based disease profiles, these were compared to presence or absence of axis I diagnoses derived from structured clinical interview, and to objective neurocognitive testing. Results:
      
    

    
      Unsupervised and supervised classification to distinguish presence/absence of axis I disorders using survey-level embeddings remained discriminative, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve up to 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.74,0.91) using Gaussian mixture modeling, and cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.91, 95% CI (0.88,0.94) using logistic regression. Derived symptom measures and estimated Research Domain Criteria scores also associated significantly with performance on neurocognitive tests. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our results support the potential utility of deriving dimensional phenotypic measures in psychiatric illness through the use of word embeddings, while illustrating the challenges in identifying truly orthogonal dimensions.","['1 Department of Biostatistics, Harvard T.H.

1223,iEnhancer-5Step: Identifying enhancers using hidden information of DNA sequences via Chou's 5-step rule and word embedding,"An enhancer is a short (50-1500bp) region of DNA that plays an important role in gene expression and the production of RNA and proteins. Genetic variation in enhancers has been linked to many human diseases, such as cancer, disorder or inflammatory bowel disease. Due to the importance of enhancers in genomics, the classification of enhancers has become a popular area of research in computational biology. Despite the few computational tools employed to address this problem, their resulting performance still requires improvements. In this study, we treat enhancers by the word embeddings, including sub-word information of its biological words, which then serve as features to be fed into a support vector machine algorithm to classify them. We present iEnhancer-5Step, a web server containing two-layer classifiers to identify enhancers and their strength. We are able to attain an independent test accuracy of 79% and 63.5% in the two layers, respectively. Compared to current predictors on the same dataset, our proposed method is able to yield superior performance as compared to the other methods. Moreover, this study provides a basis for further research that can enrich the field of applying natural language processing techniques in biological sequences. iEnhancer-5Step is freely accessible via http://biologydeep.com/fastenc/.","['1 Medical Humanities Research Cluster, School of Humanities, Nanyang Technological University, 48 Nanyang Ave, 639798, Singapore.

1224,Differences among Research Domain Criteria score trajectories by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual categorical diagnosis during inpatient hospitalization,"With brief psychiatric hospitalizations, the extent to which symptoms change is rarely characterized. We sought to understand symptomatic changes across Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) dimensions, and the extent to which such improvement might be associated with risk for readmission. We identified 3,634 individuals with 4,713 hospital admissions to the psychiatric inpatient unit of a large academic medical center between 2010 and 2015. We applied a natural language processing tool to extract estimates of the five RDoC domains to the admission note and discharge summary and calculated the change in each domain. We examined the extent to which symptom domains changed during admission, and their relationship to baseline clinical and sociodemographic features, using linear regression. Symptomatic worsening was rare in the negative valence (0.4%) and positive valence (5.1%) domains, but more common in cognition (25.8%). Most diagnoses exhibited improvement in negative valence, which was associated with significant reduction in readmission risk. Despite generally brief hospital stays, we detected reduction across multiple symptom domains, with greatest improvement in negative symptoms, and greatest probability of worsening in cognitive symptoms. This approach should facilitate investigations of other features or interventions which may influence pace of clinical improvement.","['1 Center for Quantitative Health, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, United States of America.', '2 Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States of America.', '3 Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States of America.']","Thomas H McCoy Jr, Amelia M Pellegrini, Roy H Perlis, ",PloS one,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32842139

      Compare diagnostic performance of screening full-field digital mammography (FFDM), a hybrid FFDM and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) environment, and DBT only. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      This institutional review board-approved, retrospective study consisted of all patients undergoing screening mammography at an urban academic medical center and outpatient imaging facility between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2017. We used the electronic health record data warehouse to extract report data and patient demographics. A validated natural language processing algorithm extracted BI-RADS score from each report. An institutional cancer registry identified cancer diagnoses. Primary outcomes of recall rate, cancer detection rate (CDR), and positive predictive value 1 (PPV1) were calculated for three periods: FFDM-only environment, hybrid environment, and DBT-only environment. A χ2 test was used to compare recall rate, CDR, and PPV1. Results:
      
    

    
      A total of 179,028 screening mammograms comprised the study cohort: 41,818 (23.3%) during the FFDM-only period, 83,125 (46.4%) during the hybrid period, and 54,084 (30.2%) during the DBT-only period. Recall rates were 10.4% (4,279 of 41,280) for the FFDM-only period, 10.6% (8,761 of 82,917) for the hybrid period, and 10.8% (5,850 of 54,020) for the DBT-only period (P = .96). CDR (cancers per 1,000 examinations) was 2.6 per 1,000, 4.9 per 1,000, and 6.0 per 1,000 for FFDM only, hybrid, and DBT only, respectively (P < .01). PPV1s (number of cancers per number of recalls) were 2.5% for the FFDM-only period, 4.6% for the hybrid period, and 5.6% for the DBT-only period (P < .01). Conclusion:

1226,An Empirical Test of GRUs and Deep Contextualized Word Representations on De-Identification,"De-identification aims to remove 18 categories of protected health information from electronic health records. Ideally, de-identification systems should be reliable and generalizable. Previous research has focused on improving performance but has not examined generalizability. This paper investigates both performance and generalizability. To improve current state-of-the-art performance based on long short-term memory (LSTM) units, we introduce a system that uses gated recurrent units (GRUs) and deep contextualized word representations, both of which have never been applied to de-identification. We measure performance and generalizability of each system using the 2014 i2b2/UTHealth and 2016 CEGS N-GRID de-identification datasets. We show that deep contextualized word representations improve state-of-the-art performance, while the benefit of switching LSTM units with GRUs is not significant. The generalizability of de-identification system significantly improved with deep contextualized word representations; in addition, LSTM units-based system is more generalizable than the GRUs-based system.","['1 Department of Information Science and Technology, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, United States.']","Kahyun Lee, Michele Filannino, Özlem Uzuner, ",Studies in health technology and informatics,2019,Data Anonymization; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31437917

      Indication-specific medication dosing support is needed to improve pediatric dosing support. Objective:
      
    

    
      To compare the sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) of different meningitis dosing alert triggers and dosing error rates between antimicrobials with and without meningitis order sentences. Methods:
      
    

    
      We retrospectively analyzed 4-months of pediatric orders for antimicrobials with meningitis-specific dosing. At the time of the order, it was determined if the antimicrobial was for meningitis management, if a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture was ordered, and if a natural language processing (NLP) system could detect ""meningitis"" in clinical notes. Results:
      
    

    
      Of 1383 orders, 243 were for the management of meningitis. A CSF culture or NLP combination trigger searching the electronic health record since admission yielded the greatest sensitivity for detecting meningitis management (67.5%, P < 0.01 vs others), but dosing error detection was similar if the trigger only searched 48 hours preceding the order (68.8% vs 62.5%, P = 0.125). Using a CSF culture alone and a 48-hour time frame had a higher PPV versus a combination with a 48-hour time frame (97.1% vs 80.9%, P < 0.001), and both triggers had a higher PPV than others ( P < 0.001). Antimicrobials with meningitis order sentences had fewer dosing errors (19.8% vs 43.2%, P < 0.01). Conclusion and Relevance: A meningitis dosing alert triggered by a combination of a CSF culture or NLP system and a 48-hour triggering time frame could provide reasonable sensitivity and PPV for meningitis dosing errors. Order sentences with indication-specific recommendations may provide additional dosing support, but additional studies are needed.","['1 1 College of Pharmacy, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN, USA.', '2 2 Virginia Commonwealth University Health System, Richmond, VA, USA.', ""3 3 Children's Hospital of Richmond at Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA.""]","Jeremy S Stultz, Perry Taylor, Sean McKenna, ",The Annals of pharmacotherapy,2019 Jan,clinical decision support; dosing alerts; information technology; medical informatics; natural language processing; pediatric.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30015498
1228,Determining post-test risk in a national sample of stress nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging reports: Implications for natural language processing tools,"Background:
      
    

    
      Reporting standards promote clarity and consistency of stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) reports, but do not require an assessment of post-test risk. Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools could potentially help estimate this risk, yet it is unknown whether reports contain adequate descriptive data to use NLP. Methods:
      
    

    
      Among VA patients who underwent stress MPI and coronary angiography between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2011, 99 stress test reports were randomly selected for analysis. Two reviewers independently categorized each report for the presence of critical data elements essential to describing post-test ischemic risk. Results:
      
    

    
      Few stress MPI reports provided a formal assessment of post-test risk within the impression section (3%) or the entire document (4%). In most cases, risk was determinable by combining critical data elements (74% impression, 98% whole). If ischemic risk was not determinable (25% impression, 2% whole), inadequate description of systolic function (9% impression, 1% whole) and inadequate description of ischemia (5% impression, 1% whole) were most commonly implicated. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Post-test ischemic risk was determinable but rarely reported in this sample of stress MPI reports. This supports the potential use of NLP to help clarify risk. Further study of NLP in this context is needed.","['1 Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA.

1229,Building an Experimental German User Interface Terminology Linked to SNOMED CT,"We describe the process of creating a User Interface Terminology (UIT) with the goal to generate a maximum of German language interface terms that are mapped to the reference terminology SNOMED CT. The purpose is to offer a high coverage of medical jargon in order to optimise semantic annotations of clinical documents by text mining systems. The first step consisted in the creation of an n-gram table to which words and short phrases from the English SNOMED CT description table were automatically extracted and entered. The second step was to fill up the n-gram table with human and machine translations, manually enriched by POS tags. Top-down and bottom-up methods for manual terminology population were used. Grammar rules were formulated and embedded into a term generator, which then created one-to-many German variants per SNOMED CT description. Currently, the German user interface terminology contains 4,425,948 entries, created out of 111,605 German n-grams, assigned to 95,298 English n-grams. With 341,105 active concepts and 542,462 (non FSN) descriptions, it corresponds to an average of 13 interface terms per concept and 8.2 per description. An analysis of the current quality of this resource by blinded human assessment terminology states equivalence regarding term understandability compared to a fully automated Web-based translator, which, however does not yield any synonyms, so that there are good reasons to further develop this semi-automated terminology engineering method and recommend it for other language pairs.","['1 Institute for Medical Informatics, Statistics and Documentation, Medical University of Graz, Austria.', '2 Averbis GmbH, Freiburg, Germany.']","David Hashemian Nik, Zdenko Kasáč, Zsófia Goda, Anita Semlitsch, Stefan Schulz, ",Studies in health technology and informatics,2019,Natural Language Processing; Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine; Translations.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31437904
1230,Introducing Information Extraction to Radiology Information Systems to Improve the Efficiency on Reading Reports,"Background:
      
    

    
      Radiology reports are a permanent record of patient's health information often used in clinical practice and research. Reading radiology reports is common for clinicians and radiologists. However, it is laborious and time-consuming when the amount of reports to be read is large. Assisting clinicians to locate and assimilate the key information of reports is of great significance for improving the efficiency of reading reports. There are few studies on information extraction from Chinese medical texts and its application in radiology information systems (RIS) for efficiency improvement. Objectives:
      
    

    
      The purpose of this study was to explore methods for extracting, grouping, ranking, delivering, and displaying medical-named entities in radiology reports which can yield efficiency improvement in RISs. Methods:
      
    

    
      A total of 5,000 reports were obtained from two medical institutions for this study. We proposed a neural network model called Multi-Embedding-BGRU-CRF (bidirectional gated recurrent unit-conditional random field) for medical-named entity recognition and rule-based methods for entity grouping and ranking. Furthermore, a methodology for delivering and displaying entities in RISs was presented. Results:
      
    

    
      The proposed neural named entity recognition model has achieved a good F1 score of 95.88%. Entity ranking achieved a very high accuracy of 99.23%. The weakness of the system is the entity grouping approach which yield accuracy of 91.03%. The effectiveness of the overall solution was proved by an evaluation task performed by two clinicians based on the setup of actual clinical practice. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The neural model shows great potential in extracting medical-named entities from radiology reports, especially for languages, that lack lexicons and natural language processing tools. The pipeline of extracting, grouping, ranking, delivering, and displaying medical-named entities could be a feasible solution to enhance RIS functionality by information extraction. The integration of information extraction and RIS has been demonstrated to be effective in improving the efficiency of reading radiology reports.","[""1 Laboratory for Medical Imaging Informatics, Shanghai Institute of Technical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""2 Shanghai Institute of Technical Physics, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""3 Department of Radiology, Fudan University Huadong Hospital, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""4 Department of Interventional Radiology, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.""]","Zhe Xie, Yuanyuan Yang, Mingqing Wang, Ming Li, Haozhe Huang, Dezhong Zheng, Rong Shu, Tonghui Ling, ",Methods of information in medicine,2019 Sep,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31514210

The data in these tasks are typically represented in the Euclidean space. However, there is an increasing number of applications, where data are generated from non-Euclidean domains and are represented as graphs with complex relationships and interdependency between objects. The complexity of graph data has imposed significant challenges on the existing machine learning algorithms. Recently, many studies on extending deep learning approaches for graph data have emerged. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of graph neural networks (GNNs) in data mining and machine learning fields. We propose a new taxonomy to divide the state-of-the-art GNNs into four categories, namely, recurrent GNNs, convolutional GNNs, graph autoencoders, and spatial-temporal GNNs.

We collected tweets from 878 Twitter users recruited through online solicitation and in-person contact with patients. All participants completed the four-item Centers for Disease Control Healthy Days Questionnaire at the time of enrollment and 30 days later to measure ""ground truth"" HRQOL. We used a combination of document frequency analysis, sentiment analysis, topic analysis, and concept mapping to extract features from tweets, which we then used to estimate dichotomized HRQOL (""high"" vs. ""low"") using logistic regression. Binary HRQOL status was estimated with moderate performance (AUC = 0.64). This result indicates that free-range social media data only offers a window into HRQOL, but does not afford direct access to current health status.","['1 Department of Radiological Sciences, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', '2 Center for Outcomes Research and Education, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', '3 Penn Medicine Center for Digital Health, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']","Karthik V Sarma, Brennan M R Spiegel, Mark W Reid, Shawn Chen, Raina M Merchant, Emily Seltzer, Corey W Arnold, ",Studies in health technology and informatics,2019,Natural Language Processing; Quality of Life; Social Media.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31438088

      To characterize themes of discussion and specific concerns expressed by users of an internet erectile dysfunction (ED) community using a mixed-methodology approach involving quantitative natural language processing (NLP) and qualitative annotation of content. Methods:
      
    

    
      We extracted posts and responses from the Reddit community r/ErectileDysfunction (3100 members) during June 2018 to May 2019. We applied an NLP technique called the meaning extraction method with principal component analysis to computationally identify themes of discussion. We manually annotated a subset (30%) of posts based on NLP-derived themes to evaluate specific content. Results:
      
    

    
      We analyzed 329 posts and 1702 responses. Meaning extraction method with principal component analysis identified key themes: hypogonadism symptoms, masturbation/sex, evaluation/treatment, alternative therapies, and partner factors (posts); and performance anxiety, hypogonadism evaluation, pornography, and pharmacotherapy (responses). Subset annotation of 100 posts revealed a median author age of 24 years (Interquartile Range (IQR): 20-31). 48% of discussants believed their ED was psychogenic, 38% reported depressive symptoms, and 2% mentioned self-harm/suicidality either attributed to or associated with their ED. 28% of discussants reported seeing a health care professional for ED, and 20% attempted abstinence from pornography/masturbation as a self-prescribed intervention. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Social media platforms like Reddit empower young men to discuss ED concerns. Fewer than one-third reported seeing a doctor for ED, suggesting that men turn to peers on the internet first, despite risk of misinformation. A majority attributed symptoms to psychological etiologies and excess pornography/masturbation. Depression, self-harm, and suicide emerged as potent concerns.

Three primary feature sets were constructed from disparate data sources surrounding each event and used to train machine learning models for phenotyping. Results:
      
    

    
      Random forest and penalized logistic regression models gave the best performance with cross-validated mean areas under the ROC curves (AUCs) for all severity classes of 0.893 and 0.882 respectively. Features derived from a common data model outperformed features collected from disparate data sources for the same cohort of patients (AUCs 0.893 versus 0.837, p value = 0.002). The addition of features extracted from free text to machine learning models also increased AUCs from 0.827 to 0.893 (p value < 0.0001).

Because these scores are often recorded as free text in physician reports, structured real-world evidence databases seldom include the severity. The aim of this study was to use machine learning models to impute NIHSS scores for all patients with newly diagnosed stroke from multi-institution electronic health record (EHR) data. Methods:
      
    

    
      NIHSS scores available in the Optum© de-identified Integrated Claims-Clinical dataset were extracted from physician notes by applying natural language processing (NLP) methods. The cohort analyzed in the study consists of the 7149 patients with an inpatient or emergency room diagnosis of ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, or transient ischemic attack and a corresponding NLP-extracted NIHSS score. A subset of these patients (n = 1033, 14%) were held out for independent validation of model performance and the remaining patients (n = 6116, 86%) were used for training the model. Several machine learning models were evaluated, and parameters optimized using cross-validation on the training set. The model with optimal performance, a random forest model, was ultimately evaluated on the holdout set. Results:
      
    

    
      Leveraging machine learning we identified the main factors in electronic health record data for assessing stroke severity, including death within the same month as stroke occurrence, length of hospital stay following stroke occurrence, aphagia/dysphagia diagnosis, hemiplegia diagnosis, and whether a patient was discharged to home or self-care. Comparing the imputed NIHSS scores to the NLP-extracted NIHSS scores on the holdout data set yielded an R2 (coefficient of determination) of 0.57, an R (Pearson correlation coefficient) of 0.76, and a root-mean-squared error of 4.5. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Machine learning models built on EHR data can be used to determine proxies for stroke severity. This enables severity to be incorporated in studies of stroke patient outcomes using administrative and EHR databases.","['1 Janssen Research & Development, LLC, Raritan, NJ, USA. ekogan@its.jnj.com.', '2 Janssen Research & Development, LLC, Raritan, NJ, USA.', '3 Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC, Titusville, NJ, USA.', '4 Hartford HealthCare, Hartford, CT, USA.']","Emily Kogan, Kathryn Twyman, Jesse Heap, Dejan Milentijevic, Jennifer H Lin, Mark Alberts, ",BMC medical informatics and decision making,2020,Database; Outcomes research; Real-world evidence.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31914991
1236,Can AI outperform a junior resident? Comparison of deep neural network to first-year radiology residents for identification of pneumothorax,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      To (1) develop a deep learning system (DLS) using a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) for identification of pneumothorax, (2) compare its performance to first-year radiology residents, and (3) evaluate the ability of a DLS to augment radiology residents by detecting missed pneumothoraces. Methods:
      
    

    
      This was a retrospective study performed in September 2018. We obtained 112,120 chest radiographs (CXRs) from the NIH ChestXray14 database, of which 4360 cases (4%) were labeled as pneumothorax by natural language processing. We utilized 111,518 CXRs to train and validate the ResNet-152 DCNN pretrained on ImageNet to identify pneumothorax. DCNN testing was performed on a hold-out set of 602 CXRs, whose groundtruth was determined by a cardiothoracic radiologist. Two first-year radiology residents evaluated the test CXRs for presence of pneumothorax. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated for each evaluator with area under the curve (AUC) compared using the DeLong parametric method. Results:
      
    

    
      The DCNN achieved AUC of 0.841 for identification of pneumothorax at a rate of 1980 images/min. In contrast, both first-year residents achieved significantly higher AUCs of 0.942 and 0.905 (p < 0.01 for both compared to DCNN), but at a slower rate of two images/min. The DCNN identified 3 of 31 (9.7%) additional pneumothoraces missed by at least one of the residents. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      A DLS for pneumothorax identification had lower AUC than 1st-year radiology residents, but interpreted images > 1000× as fast and identified 3 additional pneumothoraces missed by the residents. Our findings suggest that DLS could augment radiologists-in-training to identify potential urgent findings.","['1 Radiology Artificial Intelligence Lab (RAIL), Malone Center for Engineering in Healthcare, Johns Hopkins University Whiting School of Engineering, Baltimore, MD, USA. pyi10@jhmi.edu.', '2 The Russell H.

1237,Assessing the Accuracy of Machine-Assisted Abstract Screening With DistillerAI: A User Study [Internet,"Background:
      
    

    
      Web applications that employ natural language processing technologies such as text mining and text classification to support systematic reviewers during abstract screening have become more user friendly and more common. Such semi-automated screening tools can increase efficiency by reducing the number of abstracts needed to screen or by replacing one screener after adequately training the algorithm of the machine. Savings in workload between 30 percent and 70 percent might be possible with the use of such tools. The goal of our project was to conduct a case study to explore a screening approach that temporarily replaces a human screener with a semi-automated screening tool. Methods:
      
    

    
      To address our objective, we evaluated the accuracy of a machine-assisted screening approach using an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality comparative effectiveness review as the reference standard. We chose DistillerAI as a semi-automated screening tool for our project, applying its naïve Bayesian machine-learning option. Five teams screened the same 2,472 abstracts in parallel, using the machine-assisted approach. Each team trained DistillerAI with 300 randomly selected abstracts that the team screened dually. For the remaining 2,172 abstracts, DistillerAI replaced one human screener in each team and provided predictions about the relevance of records. We used a prediction score of 0.5 (i.e., inconclusive) or greater to classify a record as an inclusion. A single reviewer also screened all remaining abstracts. A second human screener resolved conflicts between the single reviewer and DistillerAI. We compared the decisions of the machine-assisted approach, single-reviewer screening (i.e., no machine assistance), and screening with DistillerAI alone (i.e., no human involvement after training) against the reference standard and calculated sensitivities, specificities, and the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve. In addition, we determined the interrater agreement, the proportion of included abstracts, and the number of conflicts between human screeners and DistillerAI. Results:
      
    

    
      The mean sensitivity of the machine-assisted screening approach across the five screening teams was 78 percent (95% confidence interval [CI], 66% to 90%), and the mean specificity was 95 percent (95% CI, 92% to 97%). By comparison, the sensitivity of single-reviewer screening was also 78 percent (95% CI, 66% to 89%); the sensitivity of DistillerAI alone was 14 percent (95% CI, 0% to 31%). Specificities for single-reviewer screening and DistillerAI alone were 94 percent (95% CI, 91% to 97%) and 98 percent (95% CI, 97% to 100%), respectively. Machine-assisted screening and single-reviewer screening had similar areas under the curve (0.87 and 0.86, respectively); by contrast, the area under the curve for DistillerAI alone was just slightly better than chance (0.56). The interrater agreement between human screeners and DistillerAI with a prevalence-adjusted kappa was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.84 to 0.86). Discussion:
      
    

    
      Findings of our study indicate that the accuracy of DistillerAI is not yet adequate to replace a human screener temporarily during abstract screening. The approach that we tested missed too many relevant studies and created too many conflicts between human screeners and DistillerAI. Rapid reviews, which do not require detecting the totality of the relevant evidence, may find semi-automation tools to have greater utility than traditional systematic reviews.","['1 RTI International–University of North Carolina Evidence-based Practice Center, Research Triangle Park, NC', '2 Danube University Krems, Department for Evidence-based Medicine and Clinical Epidemiology, Krems, Austria', '3 Department of Family Medicine, Care and Public Health Research Institute, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands']","Gerald Gartlehner, Gernot Wagner, Linda Lux, Lisa Affengruber, Andreea Dobrescu, Angela Kaminski-Hartenthaler, Meera Viswanathan, ",,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31804782
1238,Predictors and consequences of declining insulin therapy by individuals with type 2 diabetes,"Aim:
      
    

    
      To determine the relationship between decline of insulin therapy by individuals with type 2 diabetes and subsequent blood glucose control. Methods:
      
    

    
      We retrospectively studied adults with type 2 diabetes and suboptimal (HbA1c ≥ 53 mmol/mol [7.0%]) glycaemic control followed at two academic hospitals between 2000 and 2014 who were recommended insulin therapy. Decline of insulin therapy recommendations was identified using natural language processing of provider notes. Time to HbA1c < 53 mmol/mol (7.0%) served as the primary outcome. Results:
      
    

    
      Of 5307 study participants, 2267 (42.7%) declined insulin therapy. Median time to HbA1c control in individuals who declined vs. started insulin therapy was 50 vs. 38 months, respectively (P < 0.001). In multivariable analysis, decline of insulin therapy was associated with hazard ratio for HbA1c control of 0.89 (95% CI 0.82 to 0.97; P = 0.008). Participants were more likely to accept insulin therapy recommendations if they had diabetes complications (OR 1.32; 95% CI 1.13 to 1.53; P < 0.001) or a higher HbA1c (OR 1.10; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.13; P < 0.001), and less likely if they were older (OR 0.81; 95% CI 0.76 to 0.86; P < 0.001) or were taking more non-insulin diabetes medications (OR 0.78; 95% CI 0.74 to 0.83; P < 0.001). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Individuals with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes who declined insulin therapy subsequently had worse glycaemic control. These findings highlight the need to improve our understanding of the relationship of this common but poorly explored clinical phenomenon to blood glucose control and ultimately diabetes complications.","[""1 Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts."", '2 Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', '3 Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Beijing, China.']","A Turchin, N Hosomura, H Zhang, S Malmasi, M Shubina, ",Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,2020 May,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32077139
1239,Global Vectors Representation of Protein Sequences and Its Application for Predicting Self-Interacting Proteins with Multi-Grained Cascade Forest Model,"Self-interacting proteins (SIPs) is of paramount importance in current molecular biology. There have been developed a number of traditional biological experiment methods for predicting SIPs in the past few years. However, these methods are costly, time-consuming and inefficient, and often limit their usage for predicting SIPs. Therefore, the development of computational method emerges at the times require. In this paper, we for the first time proposed a novel deep learning model which combined natural language processing (NLP) method for potential SIPs prediction from the protein sequence information. More specifically, the protein sequence is de novo assembled by k-mers. Then, we obtained the global vectors representation for each protein sequences by using natural language processing (NLP) technique. Finally, based on the knowledge of known self-interacting and non-interacting proteins, a multi-grained cascade forest model is trained to predict SIPs. Comprehensive experiments were performed on yeast and human datasets, which obtained an accuracy rate of 91.45% and 93.12%, respectively. From our evaluations, the experimental results show that the use of amino acid semantics information is very helpful for addressing the problem of sequences containing both self-interacting and non-interacting pairs of proteins. This work would have potential applications for various biological classification problems.","['1 The Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi 830011, China.', '2 University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.', '3 Department of Information Systems, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.']","Zhan-Heng Chen, Zhu-Hong You, Wen-Bo Zhang, Yan-Bin Wang, Li Cheng, Daniyal Alghazzawi, ",Genes,2019,de novo protein sequence; global vector representation; multi-grained cascade forest; self-interacting proteins.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31726752
1240,Visual Exploration of Neural Document Embedding in Information Retrieval: Semantics and Feature Selection,"Neural embeddings are widely used in language modeling and feature generation with superior computational power. Particularly, neural document embedding - converting texts of variable-length to semantic vector representations - has shown to benefit widespread downstream applications, e.g., information retrieval (IR). However, the black-box nature makes it difficult to understand how the semantics are encoded and employed. We propose visual exploration of neural document embedding to gain insights into the underlying embedding space, and promote the utilization in prevalent IR applications. In this study, we take an IR application-driven view, which is further motivated by biomedical IR in healthcare decision-making, and collaborate with domain experts to design and develop a visual analytics system. This system visualizes neural document embeddings as a configurable document map and enables guidance and reasoning; facilitates to explore the neural embedding space and identify salient neural dimensions (semantic features) per task and domain interest; and supports advisable feature selection (semantic analysis) along with instant visual feedback to promote IR performance. We demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of this system and present inspiring findings in use cases.

1241,Semi-Automated evidence synthesis in health psychology: current methods and future prospects,"The evidence base in health psychology is vast and growing rapidly. These factors make it difficult (and sometimes practically impossible) to consider all available evidence when making decisions about the state of knowledge on a given phenomenon (e.g., associations of variables, effects of interventions on particular outcomes). Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and other rigorous syntheses of the research mitigate this problem by providing concise, actionable summaries of knowledge in a given area of study. Yet, conducting these syntheses has grown increasingly laborious owing to the fast accumulation of new evidence; existing, manual methods for synthesis do not scale well. In this article, we discuss how semi-automation via machine learning and natural language processing methods may help researchers and practitioners to review evidence more efficiently. We outline concrete examples in health psychology, highlighting practical, open-source technologies available now.

1242,Word stress representations are language-specific: Evidence from event-related brain potentials,"Understanding speech at the basic levels entails the simultaneous and independent processing of phonemic and prosodic features. While it is well-established that phoneme perception relies on language-specific long-term traces, it is unclear if the processing of prosodic features similarly involves language-specific representations. In the present study, we investigated the processing of a specific prosodic feature, word stress, using the method of event-related brain potentials (ERPs) employing a cross-linguistic approach. Hungarian participants heard disyllabic pseudowords stressed either on the first (legal stress) or on the second (illegal stress) syllable, pronounced either by a Hungarian or a German speaker. Results obtained using a data-driven ERP analysis methodology showed that all pseudowords in the deviant position elicited an Early Differentiating Negativity and a Mismatch Negativity component, except for the Hungarian pseudowords stressed on the first syllable. This suggests that Hungarian listeners did not process the native legal stress pattern as deviant, but the same stress pattern with a nonnative accent was processed as deviant. This implies that the processing of word stress was based on language-specific long-term memory traces.","['1 Brain Imaging Centre, Research Centre for Natural Sciences, Budapest, Hungary.', '2 Institute of Psychology, ELTE Eötvös Loránd University, Budapest, Hungary.', '3 Department of Cognitive Science, Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Budapest, Hungary.', '4 Faculty of Modern Philology and Social Sciences, University of Pannonia, Budapest, Hungary.']","Ferenc Honbolygó, Andrea Kóbor, Borbála German, Valéria Csépe, ",Psychophysiology,2020 May,ERP; MMN; prosody; speech; word stress.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32022278
1243,Reconstructing the patient's natural history from electronic health records,"The automatic extraction of a patient's natural history from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is a critical step towards building intelligent systems that can reason about clinical variables and support decision making. Although EHRs contain a large amount of valuable information about the patient's medical care, this information can only be fully understood when analyzed in a temporal context. Any intelligent system should then be able to extract medical concepts, date expressions, temporal relations and the temporal ordering of medical events from the free texts of EHRs; yet, this task is hard to tackle, due to the domain specific nature of EHRs, writing quality and lack of structure of these texts, and more generally the presence of redundant information. In this paper, we introduce a new Natural Language Processing (NLP) framework, capable of extracting the aforementioned elements from EHRs written in Spanish using rule-based methods. We focus on building medical timelines, which include disease diagnosis and its progression over time. By using a large dataset of EHRs comprising information about patients suffering from lung cancer, we show that our framework has an adequate level of performance by correctly building the timeline for 843 patients from a pool of 989 patients, achieving a precision of 0.852.","['1 Centro de Tecnología Biomédica, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain; Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro Majadahonda, Madrid, Spain.

1244,iN6-methylat (5-step): identifying DNA N 6-methyladenine sites in rice genome using continuous bag of nucleobases via Chou's 5-step rule,"DNA N6-methyladenine is a non-canonical DNA modification that occurs in different eukaryotes at low levels and it has been identified as an extremely important function of life. Moreover, about 0.2% of adenines are marked by DNA N6-methyladenine in the rice genome, higher than in most of the other species. Therefore, the identification of them has become a very important area of study, especially in biological research. Despite the few computational tools employed to address this problem, there still requires a lot of efforts to improve their performance results. In this study, we treat DNA sequences by the continuous bags of nucleobases, including sub-word information of its biological words, which then serve as features to be fed into a support vector machine algorithm to identify them. Our model which uses this hybrid approach could identify DNA N6-methyladenine sites with achieved a jackknife test sensitivity of 86.48%, specificity of 89.09%, accuracy of 87.78%, and MCC of 0.756. Compared to the state-of-the-art predictor as well as the other methods, our proposed model is able to yield superior performance in all the metrics.

      To investigate associations between central anticholinergic burden (determined through the anticholinergic effect on cognition [AEC] scale) and mortality, hospitalisation and cognitive decline in patients with dementia. Methods:
      
    

    
      The South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (SLaM) Clinical Records Interactive Search (CRIS) application was used to identify patients with a first diagnosis of dementia. Medication exposure was extracted through a natural language processing algorithm, allowing for calculations and comparisons of AEC scores. Data were linked to national mortality and hospitalisation data sources, and serially recorded Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores were used to investigate cognitive decline. Results:
      
    

    
      We identified 14 093 patients with dementia, 60.7% were female and the mean age at diagnosis was 79.8 years. Patients for whom a review of their medication was indicated (AEC score ≥ 2 for any individual drug or total AEC score ≥ 3) had an increased risk of mortality (hazard ratio 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-1.15) and emergency hospitalisation (1.10; 95% CI: 1.04-1.17), but there were no associations with duration of hospitalisation.

Current state-of-the-art approaches for DDI extraction task are based on artificial intelligence and natural language processing. While such existing DDI extraction methods can provide more knowledge and enhance the performance through external resources such as biomedical databases or ontologies, due to the difficulty of updating, these external resources are delayed. In fact, user generated content (UGC) is another kind of external medical resources that can be quickly updated. We are trying to use UGC resources to provide more available information for our deep learning DDI extraction method. In this paper, we present a DDI extraction approach through a new attention mechanism called full-attention which can combine the UGC information with contextual information.

1247,An automated data verification approach for improving data quality in a clinical registry,"Background and objective:
      
    

    
      The quality of data is crucial for clinical registry studies as it impacts credibility. In the regular practice of most such studies, a vulnerability arises from researchers recording data on paper-based case report forms (CRFs) and further transcribing them onto registry databases. To ensure the quality of data, verifying data in the registry is necessary. However, traditional manual data verification methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive and of limited-effect. As paper-based CRFs and electronic medical records (EMRs) are two sources for verification, we propose an automated data verification approach based on the techniques of optical character recognition (OCR) and information retrieval to identify data errors in a registry more efficiently. Methods:
      
    

    
      Three steps are involved to develop the automated verification approach. First, we analyze the scanned images of paper-based CRFs with machine learning enhanced OCR to recognize the checkbox marks and hand-writing. Then, we retrieve the related patient information from the EMRs using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Finally, we compare the retrieved information in the previous two steps with the data in the registry, and synthesize the results accordingly. The proposed automated method has been applied in a Chinese registry study and the difference between automated and manual approach has been evaluated. Results:
      
    

    
      The automated approach has been implemented in The Chinese Coronary Artery Disease Registry. For CRF data recognition, the accuracy of recognition for checkboxes marks and hand-writing are 0.93 and 0.74, respectively. For EMR data extraction, the accuracy of information retrieval from textual electronic medical records is 0.97. The accuracy, recall and time consumption of the automated approach are 0.93, 0.96 and 0.5 h, better than the corresponding values of the manual approach, which are 0.92, 0.71 and 7.5 h. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Compared to the manual data verification approach, the automated approach enhances the recall of identify data errors and has a higher accuracy. The time consumed is far less. The results show that the automated approach is more effective and efficient for identifying incomplete data and incorrect data in a registry. The proposed approach has potential to improve the quality of registry data.","['1 College of Biomedical Engineering and Instrument Science, Zhejiang University, Zheda Road, 310027 Hanghzou, China; Key Laboratory for Biomedical Engineering, Ministry of Education, China.

A general search for online media referencing agricultural fair keywords was designed; social and online media mentions of agricultural fairs (n = 2,091,350 mentions) were further queried according to their reference to livestock, fair food, or the major agricultural product producing species of dairy and beef cattle (n = 68,900), poultry (n = 39,600), and swine (n = 31,250). Numbers of search results were found to be seasonal and Twitter was the single largest domain for all fair-related results; in contrast, the majority of livestock-related media was generated by news sources rather than from Twitter. On a weekly basis, the percentage of fair livestock mentions with species-specific reference was highly variable ranging from 0% to 86.8% for cattle, 0% to 85.7% for poultry, and 0% to 76.9% for swine. In addition to quantifying total search hits or mentions, the positivity/negativity of the search results was analyzed using natural language processing capabilities. The net sentiment quantified is the total percentage of positive posts minus the percentage of negative posts, which results in a necessarily bounded net sentiment between -100% and +100%. Overall net sentiment associated with mentions of agricultural fairs was positive; the topics garnering the highest positive sentiments were fair food and cattle (both 98% positive). Online discussion pertaining to agricultural fairs and swine was overall positive despite references to swine flu outbreaks. In conclusion, livestock and animal products had positive net sentiment over the time period studied, but there are multiple aspects of agricultural fairs worthy of further investigation and continued vigilance, including zoonotic disease risk and public perceptions of livestock industries.","['1 United Animal Health, Sheridan, IN.', '2 Department of Agricultural Economics, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN.', '3 Department of Agricultural Economics, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK.']","Julie A Mahoney, Nicole J O Widmar, Courtney L Bir, ",Translational animal science,2020,agricultural fair; fairs; livestock; online media sentiment; zoonotic disease.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32832858
1249,Understanding Patient Attitudes Toward Multifocal Intraocular Lenses in Online Medical Forums Through Sentiment Analysis,"Multifocal intraocular lens implants (IOLs) are a premium option for cataract surgery which patients may purchase to achieve improved spectacle-independence for near vision but may have trade-offs with visual quality. We demonstrate the use of sentiment analysis to evaluate multifocal lenses discussed on MedHelp, a leading online health forum. A search for ""multifocal IOL"" was performed on MedHelp.org on November 1, 2016, yielding relevant patient posts. Sentiment analysis was performed using IBM's Watson, which extracted 30,066 unique keywords and their associated sentiment scores from 7495 posts written by 1474 unique patient users. Keywords associated with monovision, monofocal, and toric lenses had positive mean sentiment, significantly higher than for keywords associated with multifocals, which had negative mean sentiment (p < 0.001, ANOVA). Many keywords represented complaints and were associated with negative sentiment, including glare, halo, and ghosting. Sentiment analysis can provide insights into patient perspectives towards multifocal lenses by interpreting online patient posts.","['1 Byers Eye Institute, Stanford University, Palo Alto CA, USA.', '2 Biomedical Informatics Research Center, Stanford University, Palo Alto CA, USA.', '3 Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System, Palo Alto CA, USA.']","Sophia Y Wang, Tina Hernandez-Boussard, Robert T Chang, Suzann Pershing, ",Studies in health technology and informatics,2019,Multifocal Intraocular Lenses; Natural Language Processing; Social Networking.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31438152

1251,Concordance Study Between IBM Watson for Oncology and Clinical Practice for Patients with Cancer in China,"Background:
      
    

    
      IBM Watson for Oncology (WFO), which can use natural language processing to evaluate data in structured and unstructured formats, has begun to be used in China. It provides physicians with evidence-based treatment options and ranks them in three categories for treatment decision support. This study was designed to examine the concordance between the treatment recommendation proposed by WFO and actual clinical decisions by oncologists in our cancer center, which would reflect the differences of cancer treatment between China and the U.S. Patients and methods:
      
    

    
      Retrospective data from 362 patients with cancer were ingested into WFO from April 2017 to October 2017. WFO recommendations were provided in three categories: recommended, for consideration, and not recommended. Concordance was analyzed by comparing the treatment decisions proposed by WFO with those of the multidisciplinary tumor board. Concordance was achieved when the oncologists' treatment decisions were in the recommended or for consideration categories in WFO. Results:
      
    

    
      Ovarian cancer showed the highest concordance, which was 96%. Lung cancer and breast cancer obtained a concordance of slightly above 80%. The concordance of rectal cancer was 74%, whereas colon cancer and cervical cancer showed the same concordance of 64%. In particular, the concordance of gastric cancer was very low, only 12%, and 88% of cases were under physicians choice. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Different cancer types showed different concordances, and only gastric cancers were significantly less likely to be concordant. Incidence and pharmaceuticals may be the major cause of discordance. To be comprehensively and rapidly applied in China, WFO needs to accelerate localization.

1252,Understanding public perception of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) social distancing on Twitter,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Social distancing policies are key in curtailing severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread, but their effectiveness is heavily contingent on public understanding and collective adherence. We studied public perception of social distancing through organic, large-scale discussion on Twitter. Design:
      
    

    
      Retrospective cross-sectional study. Methods:
      
    

    
      Between March 27 and April 10, 2020, we retrieved English-only tweets matching two trending social distancing hashtags, #socialdistancing and #stayathome. We analyzed the tweets using natural language processing and machine-learning models, and we conducted a sentiment analysis to identify emotions and polarity. We evaluated the subjectivity of tweets and estimated the frequency of discussion of social distancing rules. We then identified clusters of discussion using topic modeling and associated sentiments. Results:
      
    

    
      We studied a sample of 574,903 tweets. For both hashtags, polarity was positive (mean, 0.148; SD, 0.290); only 15% of tweets had negative polarity. Tweets were more likely to be objective (median, 0.40; IQR, 0-0.6) with ~30% of tweets labeled as completely objective (labeled as 0 in range from 0 to 1). Approximately half of tweets (50.4%) primarily expressed joy and one-fifth expressed fear and surprise. Each correlated well with topic clusters identified by frequency including leisure and community support (ie, joy), concerns about food insecurity and quarantine effects (ie, fear), and unpredictability of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its implications (ie, surprise). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Considering the positive sentiment, preponderance of objective tweets, and topics supporting coping mechanisms, we concluded that Twitter users generally supported social distancing in the early stages of their implementation.","['1 Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas.', '2 Clinical Informatics Center, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas.', '3 Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas.', '4 Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas.']","Sameh N Saleh, Christoph U Lehmann, Samuel A McDonald, Mujeeb A Basit, Richard J Medford, ",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32758315
1253,Investigation of the clinical significance and molecular mechanism of miR-21-5p in hepatocellular carcinoma: A systematic review based on 24 studies and bioinformatics investigation,"To investigate the prospective roles and the clinicopathological application of microRNA-21-5p (miR-21-5p) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the present review is based on 24 studies and bioinformatics investigation. Firstly, HCC-associated miR-21-5p data were aggregated from literature databases and two public genomic data repositories, including the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Potential target genes of miR-21-5p in HCC were identified using TCGA and GEO, Natural Language Processing and 14 online software packages. The oncogenic roles of these target genes was probed for understanding using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. Hub genes were further investigated by protein-protein interaction network (PPI) analysis. Comprehensive meta-analysis, including 10 microarrays from GEO datasets, 13 literature studies and TCGA-based RNA sequencing data, indicated a reliable diagnostic capacity of miR-21-5p [area under the curve (AUC), 0.887; sensitivity, 0.78% and specificity, 0.79%]. The healthy control group (AUC, 0.926; sensitivity, 0.87% and specificity, 0.82%) demonstrated high diagnostic capacity of miR-21-5p compared with the chronic hepatitis B infection group (AUC, 0.904; sensitivity, 0.75% and specificity, 0.84%). A total of 10 significant enrichment pathways were indicated by KEGG analysis, with cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction exhibiting the highest score. A total of 5 genes, hepatocyte growth factor, forkhead box O1 (FOXO1), thrombospondin 1, estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 were selected from 39 overlapping genes, according to the PPI network. Target genes were assembled in GO terms associated with 'response to chemical stimulus', 'cell surface' and 'growth factor binding'. In particular, low expression of FOXO1 and ESR1 was associated with miR-21-5p expression. In conclusion, upregulated expression of miR-21-5p may be a functional regulator of the metabolism or apoptosis in HCC and a novel tumor marker for the early diagnosis of HCC.","['1 Department of Medical Ultrasonics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region 530021, P.R.

1254,Experience with Social Distancing Early in the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States: Implications for Public Health Messaging,"Our goal is to inform ongoing public health policy on the design and communication of COVID-19 social distancing measures to maximize compliance. We assessed the US publics early experience with the COVID-19 crisis during the period when shelter-in-place orders were widely implemented to understand non-compliance with those orders, sentiment about the crisis, and to compare across age categories associated with different levels of risk. We posted our survey on Twitter, Facebook, and NextDoor on March 14th to March 23rd that included 21 questions including demographics, impact on daily life, actions taken, and difficulties faced. We analyzed the free-text responses to the impact question using LIWC, a computational natural language processing tool, and performed a thematic content analysis of the reasons people gave for non-compliance with social distancing orders. Stanford Universitys IRB approved the study. In 9 days, we collected a total of 20,734 responses. 6,573 individuals provided a response (≥30 words) to the question, Tell us how the coronavirus crisis is impacting your life. Our data (Figure 1) show that younger people (18-31) are more emotionally negative, self-centered, and less concerned with family, while middle-aged people are group-oriented (32-44) and focused on family (32-64) (all p values < .05 corrected for multiple comparisons). Unsurprisingly, the oldest and most at-risk group (65+) are more focused on biological terms (e.g., health-related topics), but were surprisingly low in anxiety and high in emotionally positive terms relative to those at lower risk. We also content-analyzed 7,355 responses (kappas > .75) to the question, What are the reasons you are not self-isolating more? Of these participants, 39.8% reported not being compliant, with the youngest group (18-31) having the lowest compliance rate (52.4%) compared to the other age groups (all > 60%; all p values < .01). Table 1 describes the seven primary themes for non-compliance. Non-essential work requirements, concerns about mental and physical health, and the belief that other precautions were sufficient were the most common reasons, although other rationales included wanting to continue everyday activities and beliefs that society is over-reacting. Childcare was an important concern for a subset of respondents. Overall, our findings suggest that public health messages should focus on young people and 1) address their negative affect, 2) refocus their self-orientation by emphasizing the importance of individual behavior to group-level health outcomes, and 3) target the specific rationales that different people have regarding the pandemic to maximize compliance with social distancing.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Ryan C Moore, Angela Lee, Jeffrey T Hancock, Meghan Halley, Eleni Linos, ",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32511643
1255,Palliative Care Skills and New Resources for Oncology Practices: Meeting the Palliative Care Needs of Patients With Cancer and Their Families,"In its 2017 guideline, ASCO challenged members to integrate palliative care into their standard oncology practices for all patients, throughout their cancer trajectory. However, partnering with palliative care experts alone will not be enough to achieve that goal; there are too few experts now, and there will not be enough in the future to meet the needs of patients with cancer and their families. Other strategies are required. Oncologists can develop new communication skills that were not included in their fellowship curricula, skills that integrate into their visits the subjects that palliative care clinicians discuss routinely with patients referred to them. In this review, Dr. Back offers three questions matched to communication skills that can help oncologists explore key areas: (1) What is happening? (2) How do you (and I) feel? and (3) What is important? and discusses the ""REMAP"" strategy for making urgent medical decisions. Dr. Friedman reviews the impact of community-based palliative care resources and telehealth on care quality, patient centeredness, and reducing costs. Community-based palliative care services and telehealth are available to patients and families at home, during active treatment. Dr. Abrahm reviews how patient-reported outcomes (PROs) completed at home can enhance patients' symptom control, quality of life, and toleration of treatment and decrease unplanned emergency visits by alerting clinicians to patients' severe symptoms, making appropriate referrals, or suggesting patients contact their oncology team. She also provides an update on using PROs and natural language processing with clinical decision support to create sophisticated palliative care assessments and treatment options in the electronic health record during patients' office visits.","['1 University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA.', '2 Aspire Health, Newtown, PA.', '3 Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.']","Anthony Back, Tara Friedman, Janet Abrahm, ",American Society of Clinical Oncology educational book.

1256,Improving clinical named entity recognition in Chinese using the graphical and phonetic feature,"Background:
      
    

    
      Clinical Named Entity Recognition is to find the name of diseases, body parts and other related terms from the given text. Because Chinese language is quite different with English language, the machine cannot simply get the graphical and phonetic information form Chinese characters. The method for Chinese should be different from that for English. Chinese characters present abundant information with the graphical features, recent research on Chinese word embedding tries to use graphical information as subword. This paper uses both graphical and phonetic features to improve Chinese Clinical Named Entity Recognition based on the presence of phono-semantic characters. Methods:
      
    

    
      This paper proposed three different embedding models and tested them on the annotated data. The data have been divided into two sections for exploring the effect of the proportion of phono-semantic characters. Results:
      
    

    
      The model using primary radical and pinyin can improve Clinical Named Entity Recognition in Chinese and get the F-measure of 0.712. More phono-semantic characters does not give a better result. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The paper proves that the use of the combination of graphical and phonetic features can improve the Clinical Named Entity Recognition in Chinese.","['1 National Centre of Text Mining, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK. yifei.wang@manchester.ac.uk.', '2 National Centre of Text Mining, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', '3 Artificial Intelligence Research Center, National Research and Development Agency (AIST), Tokyo, Japan.']","Yifei Wang, Sophia Ananiadou, Jun'ichi Tsujii, ",BMC medical informatics and decision making,2019,Named entity recognition; Neural networks; Text mining.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31865903

Despite their industrial relevance, many aspects of zeolite synthesis remain poorly understood requiring costly trial and error synthesis. In this paper, we create natural language processing techniques and text markup parsing tools to automatically extract synthesis information and trends from zeolite journal articles. We further engineer a data set of germanium-containing zeolites to test the accuracy of the extracted data and to discover potential opportunities for zeolites containing germanium. We also create a regression model for a zeolite's framework density from the synthesis conditions. This model has a cross-validated root mean squared error of 0.98 T/1000 Å3, and many of the model decision boundaries correspond to known synthesis heuristics in germanium-containing zeolites. We propose that this automatic data extraction can be applied to many different problems in zeolite synthesis and enable novel zeolite morphologies.","['1 Department of Materials Science and Engineering and Department of Chemical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, United States.', '2 Instituto de Tecnología Química, Universitat Politècnica de València-Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas, Avenida de los Naranjos s/n, 46022 Valencia, Spain.']","Zach Jensen, Edward Kim, Soonhyoung Kwon, Terry Z H Gani, Yuriy Román-Leshkov, Manuel Moliner, Avelino Corma, Elsa Olivetti, ",ACS central science,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31139725

Here, we present an online resource, based on small-molecule bioactivity signatures and natural language processing, to expand the portfolio of compounds with potential to treat COVID-19. By comparing the set of drugs reported to be potentially active against SARS-CoV-2 to a universe of 1 million bioactive molecules, we identify compounds that display analogous chemical and functional features to the current COVID-19 candidates. Searches can be filtered by level of evidence and mechanism of action, and results can be restricted to drug molecules or include the much broader space of bioactive compounds.

1259,Automatically determining cause of death from verbal autopsy narratives,"Background:
      
    

    
      A verbal autopsy (VA) is a post-hoc written interview report of the symptoms preceding a person's death in cases where no official cause of death (CoD) was determined by a physician. Current leading automated VA coding methods primarily use structured data from VAs to assign a CoD category. We present a method to automatically determine CoD categories from VA free-text narratives alone. Methods:
      
    

    
      After preprocessing and spelling correction, our method extracts word frequency counts from the narratives and uses them as input to four different machine learning classifiers: naïve Bayes, random forest, support vector machines, and a neural network. Results:
      
    

    
      For individual CoD classification, our best classifier achieves a sensitivity of.770 for adult deaths for 15 CoD categories (as compared to the current best reported sensitivity of.57), and.662 with 48 WHO categories. When predicting the CoD distribution at the population level, our best classifier achieves.962 cause-specific mortality fraction accuracy for 15 categories and.908 for 48 categories, which is on par with leading CoD distribution estimation methods. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our narrative-based machine learning classifier performs as well as classifiers based on structured data at the individual level. Moreover, our method demonstrates that VA narratives provide important information that can be used by a machine learning system for automated CoD classification. Unlike the structured questionnaire-based methods, this method can be applied to any verbal autopsy dataset, regardless of the collection process or country of origin.","['1 Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada. sjeblee@cs.toronto.edu.', '2 Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Toronto, Canada. sjeblee@cs.toronto.edu.', ""3 Centre for Global Health Research, St.Michael's Hospital, Toronto, Canada."", '4 Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', '5 Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', '6 Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Toronto, Canada.', ""7 Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute, St Michael's Hospital, Toronto, Canada."", '8 Surgical Safety Technologies Inc, Toronto, Canada.']","Serena Jeblee, Mireille Gomes, Prabhat Jha, Frank Rudzicz, Graeme Hirst, ",BMC medical informatics and decision making,2019,Cause of death; Computer-coded verbal autopsy (CCVA); Machine learning; Natural language processing; Physician-certified verbal autopsy (PCVA); Tariff method; Verbal autopsy.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31288814
1260,A Virtual Counseling Application Using Artificial Intelligence for Communication Skills Training in Nursing Education: Development Study,"Background:
      
    

    
      The ability of nursing undergraduates to communicate effectively with health care providers, patients, and their family members is crucial to their nursing professions as these can affect patient outcomes. However, the traditional use of didactic lectures for communication skills training is ineffective, and the use of standardized patients is not time- or cost-effective. Given the abilities of virtual patients (VPs) to simulate interactive and authentic clinical scenarios in secured environments with unlimited training attempts, a virtual counseling application is an ideal platform for nursing students to hone their communication skills before their clinical postings. Objective:
      
    

    
      The aim of this study was to develop and test the use of VPs to better prepare nursing undergraduates for communicating with real-life patients, their family members, and other health care professionals during their clinical postings. Methods:
      
    

    
      The stages of the creation of VPs included preparation, design, and development, followed by a testing phase before the official implementation. An initial voice chatbot was trained using a natural language processing engine, Google Cloud's Dialogflow, and was later visualized into a three-dimensional (3D) avatar form using Unity 3D. Results:
      
    

    
      The VPs included four case scenarios that were congruent with the nursing undergraduates' semesters' learning objectives: (1) assessing the pain experienced by a pregnant woman, (2) taking the history of a depressed patient, (3) escalating a bleeding episode of a postoperative patient to a physician, and (4) showing empathy to a stressed-out fellow final-year nursing student. Challenges arose in terms of content development, technological limitations, and expectations management, which can be resolved by contingency planning, open communication, constant program updates, refinement, and training. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The creation of VPs to assist in nursing students' communication skills training may provide authentic learning environments that enhance students' perceived self-efficacy and confidence in effective communication skills. However, given the infancy stage of this project, further refinement and constant enhancements are needed to train the VPs to simulate real-life conversations before the official implementation.","['1 Alice Lee Centre for Nursing Studies, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', '2 Information Techonology, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore', '3 Department of Mechanical Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.']","Shefaly Shorey, Emily Ang, John Yap, Esperanza Debby Ng, Siew Tiang Lau, Chee Kong Chui, ",Journal of medical Internet research,2019,artificial intelligence; communication; learning; nursing education; patients; technology; virtual reality.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31663857

This study uses functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the relationship between auditory perception abilities and second language (L2) vocabulary learning in an effort to explore behavior-brain correlations. Twenty-one English monolinguals learned 48 auditory Chinese pseudowords over six weeks. Their pre-training abilities in non-linguistic pitch and linguistic tone perception significantly and positively predicted their novel word-learning performance, which correlated with their brain response patterns in the left Heschl's gyrus. Analyses of regions of interest (ROIs) showed coactivation of the frontal and temporal regions during novel lexical retrieval, and the non-linguistic pitch perception ability modulated brain activations in these regions. Effective connectivity analyses further indicated a collaboration of a ventral stream for speech perception and a dorsal stream for sensory-motor mapping in the L2 network. The ventral stream, compared with the dorsal stream, played a more dominant role in auditory word learning as the L2 proficiency increased. Better pitch and tone perception abilities strengthened the ventral pathways and decreased the reliance on frontal regions. These findings are discussed in light of current models of speech processing and L2 learning.","['1 Center for Linguistics and Applied Linguistics, Guangdong University of Foreign Studies, Guangzhou 510420, China. yangjing@gdufs.edu.cn.', '2 Bilingual Cognition and Development Lab, Guangdong University of Foreign Studies, Guangzhou 510420, China. yangjing@gdufs.edu.cn.', '3 Department of Psychology and Center for Brain, Behavior, and Cognition, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802, USA. yangjing@gdufs.edu.cn.', '4 Department of Psychology and Center for Brain, Behavior, and Cognition, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802, USA. pingpsu@gmail.com.']","Jing Yang, Ping Li, ",Brain sciences,2019,auditory perception; effective connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; individual differences; second language word learning.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31212921

      The positivity scores for keywords ""plastic,"" ""cosmetic,"" ""aesthetic,"" and ""reconstruction"" surgery were 5.72, 6.00, 6.16, and 6.09, respectively. In relation to ""plastic,"" keywords ""cosmetic"" and ""aesthetic"" were more positive because they lacked antagonistic words, such as ""fake,"" ""ugly,"" ""bad,"" ""fails,"" or ""wrong."" The keyword ""reconstruction,"" however, was more positively associated than the term ""plastic"" because of an increase in positive words, such as ""honor,"" ""amazing,"" ""successful,"" and ""respect."" Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Tweets containing the term ""plastic"" surgery trended toward negativity, and may be explained by the increase in unfavorable, associative words. Conversely, related terms such as ""aesthetic,"" ""cosmetic,"" and ""reconstruction"" were more favorably regarded because of the lack of antagonistic words and the presence of supportive words. The authors' results are informative and may serve to guide plastic surgeons' social media practices.","['1 Gainesville, Fla.; Irvine, Calif.; and Burlington, Vt.

1263,Learning Contextual Hierarchical Structure of Medical Concepts with Poincairé Embeddings to Clarify Phenotypes,"Biomedical association studies are increasingly done using clinical concepts, and in particular diagnostic codes from clinical data repositories as phenotypes. Clinical concepts can be represented in a meaningful, vector space using word embedding models. These embeddings allow for comparison between clinical concepts or for straightforward input to machine learning models. Using traditional approaches, good representations require high dimensionality, making downstream tasks such as visualization more difficult. We applied Poincaré embeddings in a 2-dimensional hyperbolic space to a large-scale administrative claims database and show performance comparable to 100-dimensional embeddings in a euclidean space. We then examine disease relationships under different disease contexts to better understand potential phenotypes.","['1 Department of Biomedical Informatics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA dbmi.hms.harvard.edu.']","Brett K Beaulieu-Jones, Isaac S Kohane, Andrew L Beam, ",Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing.

1264,Assessing the Availability of Data on Social and Behavioral Determinants in Structured and Unstructured Electronic Health Records: A Retrospective Analysis of a Multilevel Health Care System,"Background:
      
    

    
      Most US health care providers have adopted electronic health records (EHRs) that facilitate the uniform collection of clinical information. However, standardized data formats to capture social and behavioral determinants of health (SBDH) in structured EHR fields are still evolving and not adopted widely. Consequently, at the point of care, SBDH data are often documented within unstructured EHR fields that require time-consuming and subjective methods to retrieve. Meanwhile, collecting SBDH data using traditional surveys on a large sample of patients is infeasible for health care providers attempting to rapidly incorporate SBDH data in their population health management efforts. A potential approach to facilitate targeted SBDH data collection is applying information extraction methods to EHR data to prescreen the population for identification of immediate social needs. Objective:
      
    

    
      Our aim was to examine the availability and characteristics of SBDH data captured in the EHR of a multilevel academic health care system that provides both inpatient and outpatient care to patients with varying SBDH across Maryland. Methods:
      
    

    
      We measured the availability of selected patient-level SBDH in both structured and unstructured EHR data. We assessed various SBDH including demographics, preferred language, alcohol use, smoking status, social connection and/or isolation, housing issues, financial resource strains, and availability of a home address. EHR's structured data were represented by information collected between January 2003 and June 2018 from 5,401,324 patients. EHR's unstructured data represented information captured for 1,188,202 patients between July 2016 and May 2018 (a shorter time frame because of limited availability of consistent unstructured data). We used text-mining techniques to extract a subset of SBDH factors from EHR's unstructured data. Results:
      
    

    
      We identified a valid address or zip code for 5.2 million (95.00%) of approximately 5.4 million patients. Ethnicity was captured for 2.7 million (50.00%), whereas race was documented for 4.9 million (90.00%) and a preferred language for 2.7 million (49.00%) patients. Information regarding alcohol use and smoking status was coded for 490,348 (9.08%) and 1,728,749 (32.01%) patients, respectively. Using the International Classification of Diseases-10th Revision diagnoses codes, we identified 35,171 (0.65%) patients with information related to social connection/isolation, 10,433 (0.19%) patients with housing issues, and 3543 (0.07%) patients with income/financial resource strain. Of approximately 1.2 million unique patients with unstructured data, 30,893 (2.60%) had at least one clinical note containing phrases referring to social connection/isolation, 35,646 (3.00%) included housing issues, and 11,882 (1.00%) had mentions of financial resource strain. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Apart from demographics, SBDH data are not regularly collected for patients. Health care providers should assess the availability and characteristics of SBDH data in EHRs. Evaluating the quality of SBDH data can potentially enable health care providers to modify underlying workflows to improve the documentation, collection, and extraction of SBDH data from EHRs.","['1 Center for Population Health IT, Department of Health Policy and Management, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, United States.', '2 Johns Hopkins Center for Health Disparities Solutions, Baltimore, MD, United States.', '3 Center for Clinical Data Analysis, Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States.', '4 Division of Health Sciences Informatics, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States.', '5 Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States.', '6 Department of Health, Behavior, and Society, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, United States.', '7 Department of Acute and Chronic Care, Johns Hopkins School of Nursing, Baltimore, MD, United States.', '8 Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology & Clinical Research, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, United States.', '9 Behavioral, Social and Systems Sciences Translational Research Community, Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States.', '10 Center for Health Services and Outcomes Research, Department of Health Policy and Management, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, United States.', '11 Armstrong Institute for Patient Safety and Quality, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States.']","Elham Hatef, Masoud Rouhizadeh, Iddrisu Tia, Elyse Lasser, Felicia Hill-Briggs, Jill Marsteller, Hadi Kharrazi, ",JMIR medical informatics,2019,electronic health record; multi-level health care system; natural language processing; social and behavioral determinants of health; structured data; unstructured data.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31376277
1265,The Anatomy of the SARS-CoV-2 Biomedical Literature: Introducing the CovidX Network Algorithm for Drug Repurposing Recommendation,"Background:
      
    

    
      Driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and the dire need to discover an antiviral drug, we explored the landscape of the SARS-CoV-2 biomedical publications to identify potential treatments. Objective:
      
    

    
      The aims of this study are to identify off-label drugs that may have benefits for the coronavirus disease pandemic, present a novel ranking algorithm called CovidX to recommend existing drugs for potential repurposing, and validate the literature-based outcome with drug knowledge available in clinical trials. Methods:
      
    

    
      To achieve such objectives, we applied natural language processing techniques to identify drugs and linked entities (eg, disease, gene, protein, chemical compounds). When such entities are linked, they form a map that can be further explored using network science tools. The CovidX algorithm was based upon a notion that we called ""diversity."" A diversity score for a given drug was calculated by measuring how ""diverse"" a drug is calculated using various biological entities (regardless of the cardinality of actual instances in each category). The algorithm validates the ranking and awards those drugs that are currently being investigated in open clinical trials. The rationale behind the open clinical trial is to provide a validating mechanism of the PubMed results. This ensures providing up to date evidence of the fast development of this disease. Results:
      
    

    
      From the analyzed biomedical literature, the algorithm identified 30 possible drug candidates for repurposing, ranked them accordingly, and validated the ranking outcomes against evidence from clinical trials. The top 10 candidates according to our algorithm are hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, chloroquine, ritonavir, losartan, remdesivir, favipiravir, methylprednisolone, rapamycin, and tilorone dihydrochloride. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The ranking shows both consistency and promise in identifying drugs that can be repurposed. We believe, however, the full treatment to be a multifaceted, adjuvant approach where multiple drugs may need to be taken at the same time.","['1 School of Nursing, Norwich University, Northfield, VT, United States.', '2 School of Cybersecurity, Data Science, and Computing, Norwich University, Northfield, VT, United States.']","Lyndsey Elaine Gates, Ahmed Abdeen Hamed, ",Journal of medical Internet research,2020,COVID-19; COVID-19 treatment; antiviral; biomedical; drug; drug repurposing; health; informatics; network algorithm; ranking.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32735546
1266,Impact of ICD10 and secular changes on electronic medical record rheumatoid arthritis algorithms,"Objective:
      
    

    
      The objective of this study was to compare the performance of an RA algorithm developed and trained in 2010 utilizing natural language processing and machine learning, using updated data containing ICD10, new RA treatments, and a new electronic medical records (EMR) system. Methods:
      
    

    
      We extracted data from subjects with ≥1 RA International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes from the EMR of two large academic centres to create a data mart. Gold standard RA cases were identified from reviewing a random 200 subjects from the data mart, and a random 100 subjects who only have RA ICD10 codes. We compared the performance of the following algorithms using the original 2010 data with updated data: (i) a published 2010 RA algorithm; (ii) updated algorithm, incorporating ICD10 RA codes and new DMARDs; and (iii) published algorithm using ICD codes only, ICD RA code ≥3. Results:
      
    

    
      The gold standard RA cases had mean age 65.5 years, 78.7% female, 74.1% RF or antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) positive. The positive predictive value (PPV) for ≥3 RA ICD was 54%, compared with 56% in 2010. At a specificity of 95%, the PPV of the 2010 algorithm and the updated version were both 91%, compared with 94% (95% CI: 91, 96%) in 2010. In subjects with ICD10 data only, the PPV for the updated 2010 RA algorithm was 93%. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The 2010 RA algorithm validated with the updated data with similar performance characteristics as the 2010 data. While the 2010 algorithm continued to perform better than the rule-based approach, the PPV of the latter also remained stable over time.","[""1 Division of Rheumatology, Inflammation, and Immunity, Brigham and Women's Hospital."", '2 Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School.', '3 Research Information Science and Computing, Partners Healthcare.', '4 Department of Biomedical Informatics, Harvard Medical School.', '5 Department of Biostatistics, Harvard T.H.

1267,An Electronic Health Record Text Mining Tool to Collect Real-World Drug Treatment Outcomes: A Validation Study in Patients With Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma,"Real-world evidence can close the inferential gap between marketing authorization studies and clinical practice. However, the current standard for real-world data extraction from electronic health records (EHRs) for treatment evaluation is manual review (MR), which is time-consuming and laborious. Clinical Data Collector (CDC) is a novel natural language processing and text mining software tool for both structured and unstructured EHR data and only shows relevant EHR sections improving efficiency. We investigated CDC as a real-world data (RWD) collection method, through application of CDC queries for patient inclusion and information extraction on a cohort of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) receiving systemic drug treatment. Baseline patient characteristics, disease characteristics, and treatment outcomes were extracted and these were compared with MR for validation. One hundred patients receiving 175 treatments were included using CDC, which corresponded to 99% with MR. Calculated median overall survival was 21.7 months (95% confidence interval (CI) 18.7-24.8) vs. 21.7 months (95% CI 18.6-24.8) and progression-free survival 8.9 months (95% CI 5.4-12.4) vs. 7.6 months (95% CI 5.7-9.4) for CDC vs. MR, respectively. Highest F1-score was found for cancer-related variables (88.1-100), followed by comorbidities (71.5-90.4) and adverse drug events (53.3-74.5), with most diverse scores on international metastatic RCC database criteria (51.4-100). Mean data collection time was 12 minutes (CDC) vs. 86 minutes (MR). In conclusion, CDC is a promising tool for retrieving RWD from EHRs because the correct patient population can be identified as well as relevant outcome data, such as overall survival and progression-free survival.","['1 Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Toxicology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.']","Sylvia A van Laar, Kim B Gombert-Handoko, Henk-Jan Guchelaar, Juliëtte Zwaveling, ",Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32575147

1269,Hybrid phenotype mining method for investigating off-target protein and underlying side effects of anti-tumor immunotherapy,"Background:
      
    

    
      It is of utmost importance to investigate novel therapies for cancer, as it is a major cause of death. In recent years, immunotherapies, especially those against immune checkpoints, have been developed and brought significant improvement in cancer management. However, on the other hand, immune checkpoints blockade (ICB) by monoclonal antiboties may cause common and severe adverse reactions (ADRs), the cause of which remains largely undetermined. We hypothesize that ICB-agents may induce adverse reactions through off-target protein interactions, similar to the ADR-causing off-target effects of small molecules. In this study, we propose a hybrid phenotype mining approach which integrates molecular level information and provides new mechanistic insights for ICB-associated ADRs. Methods:
      
    

    
      We trained a conditional random fields model on the TAC 2017 benchmark training data, then used it to extract all drug-centric phenotypes for the five anti-PD-1/PD-L1 drugs from the drug labels of the DailyMed database. Proteins with structure similar to the drugs were obtained by using BlastP, and the gene targets of drugs were obtained from the STRING database. The target-centric phenotypes were extracted from the human phenotype ontology database. Finally, a screening module was designed to investigate off-target proteins, by making use of gene ontology analysis and pathway analysis. Results:
      
    

    
      Eventually, through the cross-analysis of the drug and target gene phenotypes, the off-target effect caused by the mutation of gene BTK was found, and the candidate side-effect off-target site was analyzed. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      This research provided a hybrid method of biomedical natural language processing and bioinformatics to investigate the off-target-based mechanism of ICB treatment. The method can also be applied for the investigation of ADRs related to other large molecule drugs.","['1 Hubei Key Lab of Agricultural Bioinformatics, College of Informatics, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China.', '2 Department of Urology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', '3 Institut Curie, CNRS, UMR144, Molecular Oncology Team, PSL Research University, Paris, France.', '4 Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS, LIMSI, Orsay, France.', '5 Hubei Key Lab of Agricultural Bioinformatics, College of Informatics, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China. xiajingbo.math@gmail.com.']","Yuyu Zheng, Xiangyu Meng, Pierre Zweigenbaum, Lingling Chen, Jingbo Xia, ",BMC medical informatics and decision making,2020,CRF; Immune checkpoint; PD-1; PD-L1; off-target effect.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32646421
1270,People With Central Vision Loss Have Difficulty Watching Videos,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      People with central vision loss (CVL) often report difficulties watching video. We objectively evaluated the ability to follow the story (using the information acquisition method). Methods:
      
    

    
      Subjects with CVL (n = 23) or normal vision (NV, n = 60) described the content of 30-second video clips from movies and documentaries. We derived an objective information acquisition (IA) score for each response using natural-language processing. To test whether the impact of CVL was simply due to reduced resolution, another group of NV subjects (n = 15) described video clips with defocus blur that reduced visual acuity to 20/50 to 20/800. Mixed models included random effects correcting for differences between subjects and between the clips, with age, gender, cognitive status, and education as covariates. Results:
      
    

    
      Compared to both NV groups, IA scores were worse for the CVL group (P < 0.001). IA reduced with worsening visual acuity (P < 0.001), and the reduction with worsening visual acuity was greater for the CVL group than the NV-defocus group (P = 0.01), which was seen as a greater discrepancy at worse levels of visual acuity. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The IA method was able to detect difficulties in following the story experienced by people with CVL. Defocus blur failed to recreate the CVL experience.

1272,TermInformer: unsupervised term mining and analysis in biomedical literature,"Terminology is the most basic information that researchers and literature analysis systems need to understand. Mining terms and revealing the semantic relationships between terms can help biomedical researchers find solutions to some major health problems and motivate researchers to explore innovative biomedical research issues. However, how to mine terms from biomedical literature remains a challenge. At present, the research on text segmentation in natural language processing (NLP) technology has not been well applied in the biomedical field. Named entity recognition models usually require a large amount of training corpus, and the types of entities that the model can recognize are limited. Besides, dictionary-based methods mainly use pre-established vocabularies to match the text. However, this method can only match terms in a specific field, and the process of collecting terms is time-consuming and labour-intensive. Many scenarios faced in the field of biomedical research are unsupervised, i.e. unlabelled corpora, and the system may not have much prior knowledge. This paper proposes the TermInformer project, which aims to mine the meaning of terms in an open fashion by calculating terms and find solutions to some of the significant problems in our society. We propose an unsupervised method that can automatically mine terms in the text without relying on external resources. Our method can generally be applied to any document data. Combined with the word vector training algorithm, we can obtain reusable term embeddings, which can be used in any NLP downstream application. This paper compares term embeddings with existing word embeddings. The results show that our method can better reflect the semantic relationship between terms. Finally, we use the proposed method to find potential factors and treatments for lung cancer, breast cancer, and coronavirus.","['1 Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Padua, Italy.', '2 The Open University, London, UK.', '3 School of Information Systems, Science and Engineering Faculty, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia.', '4 Department of Software Engineering, College of Computer and Information Sciences, King Saud University, Riyadh, 11543 Saudi Arabia.']","Prayag Tiwari, Sagar Uprety, Shahram Dehdashti, M Shamim Hossain, ",Neural computing & applications,2020,Biomedical literature; GloVe; Sequence labelling; Term embeddings; Term mining; Unsupervised learning.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32958982

      The aims of this study were to evaluate patient, radiologist, and examination characteristics affecting screening mammography recall rates in an academic breast imaging practice and to identify modifiable factors that could reduce recall variation. Methods:
      
    

    
      This institutional review board-approved retrospective study included screening mammographic examinations in female patients interpreted by 13 breast imaging specialists at an academic center and two outpatient centers from October 1, 2012, to May 31, 2015. Patient demographics were extracted via electronic medical record. Natural language processing captured breast density, BI-RADS assignment, and current and prior screening examination findings. Radiologists' annual screening volumes, clinical experience, and concentration in breast imaging were calculated. Risk aversion, stress from uncertainty, and malpractice concerns were derived via survey. Univariate and multivariate analyses assessed patient, radiologist, and examination characteristics associated with likelihood of mammography recall. The Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient was used to assess the relationship between cancer detection rate and recall rate. Results:
      
    

    
      Overall, 5,678 of 61,198 screening examinations (9.3%) were recalled. In multivariate analysis, patient and radiologist characteristics associated with higher odds of recall included patient's age < 50 years (P < .0001), prior mammographic findings (calcification [P < .0001], mass [P < .0001], higher density category [P < .0001]), baseline examination (P < .0001), annual reading volume < 1,250 examinations (P = .0282), and <10 years of experience (P = .0036). Radiologist's risk aversion, stress from uncertainty, malpractice concerns, and cancer detection rates were not associated with higher recall rates (r = -0.36, P = .23). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      In addition to patient and examination factors, screening recall variations were associated with radiologists' annual reading volume and experience. Interventions targeting radiologist factors (screening volumes, second review of potential recalls) may help reduce unwarranted variation in screening recall.","[""1 Center for Evidence-Based Imaging, Department of Radiology, Harvard Medical School, Brigham and Women's Hospital, 75 Francis Street, Boston, Massachusetts.

1274,Information Visualization Platform for Postmarket Surveillance Decision Support,"Introduction:
      
    

    
      The US FDA receives more than 2 million postmarket reports each year. Safety Evaluators (SEs) review these reports, as well as external information, to identify potential safety signals. With the increasing number of reports and the size of external information, more efficient solutions for data integration and decision making are needed. Objectives:
      
    

    
      The aim of this study was to develop an interactive decision support application for drug safety surveillance that integrates and visualizes information from postmarket reports, product labels, and biomedical literature. Methods:
      
    

    
      We conducted multiple meetings with a group of seven SEs at the FDA to collect the requirements for the Information Visualization Platform (InfoViP). Using infographic design principles, we implemented the InfoViP prototype version as a modern web application using the integrated information collected from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System, the DailyMed repository, and PubMed. The same group of SEs evaluated the InfoViP prototype functionalities using a simple evaluation form and provided input for potential enhancements. Results:
      
    

    
      The SEs described their workflows and overall expectations around the automation of time-consuming tasks, including the access to the visualization of external information. We developed a set of wireframes, shared them with the SEs, and finalized the InfoViP design. The InfoViP prototype architecture relied on a javascript and a python-based framework, as well as an existing tool for the processing of free-text information in all sources. This natural language processing tool supported multiple functionalities, especially the construction of time plots for individual postmarket reports and groups of reports. Overall, we received positive comments from the SEs during the InfoViP prototype evaluation and addressed their suggestions in the final version. Conclusions:

1276,Compound-protein interaction prediction with end-to-end learning of neural networks for graphs and sequences,"Motivation:
      
    

    
      In bioinformatics, machine learning-based methods that predict the compound-protein interactions (CPIs) play an important role in the virtual screening for drug discovery. Recently, end-to-end representation learning for discrete symbolic data (e.g. words in natural language processing) using deep neural networks has demonstrated excellent performance on various difficult problems. For the CPI problem, data are provided as discrete symbolic data, i.e. compounds are represented as graphs where the vertices are atoms, the edges are chemical bonds, and proteins are sequences in which the characters are amino acids. In this study, we investigate the use of end-to-end representation learning for compounds and proteins, integrate the representations, and develop a new CPI prediction approach by combining a graph neural network (GNN) for compounds and a convolutional neural network (CNN) for proteins. Results:
      
    

    
      Our experiments using three CPI datasets demonstrated that the proposed end-to-end approach achieves competitive or higher performance as compared to various existing CPI prediction methods. In addition, the proposed approach significantly outperformed existing methods on an unbalanced dataset. This suggests that data-driven representations of compounds and proteins obtained by end-to-end GNNs and CNNs are more robust than traditional chemical and biological features obtained from databases. Although analyzing deep learning models is difficult due to their black-box nature, we address this issue using a neural attention mechanism, which allows us to consider which subsequences in a protein are more important for a drug compound when predicting its interaction. The neural attention mechanism also provides effective visualization, which makes it easier to analyze a model even when modeling is performed using real-valued representations instead of discrete features.

1277,Using a digital patient powered research network to identify outcomes of importance to patients with multiple myeloma,"Background:
      
    

    
      Social media platforms give patients a voice by allowing them to discuss their health and connect with others. These unfiltered and genuine reports offer direct access to what matters most to patients. Exploring the patient-reported outcomes discussed in these platforms reveal clinical insights and behavioral patterns of the real-world patient journey. This research study reviewed health-related quality of life (HRQoL) concepts reported by patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Methods:
      
    

    
      Data were obtained using the Belong.life patient-powered research network (PPRN) using social media listening methods. The analysis cohort consisted of adults diagnosed with MM who signed into the Belong.life platform by June 2018. Natural language processing and medical neural networks were utilized to extract text data to mine and scan for concepts using programmed algorithms. The textual review of the data was conducted on two levels: the over-arching concept of interest (broad symptom and impact classification) and the more specific symptom and impacts report. Concepts were analyzed descriptively and summarized by age, gender, context of report, and stage of disease/treatment journey. Results:
      
    

    
      Two hundred thirty patients with MM from the United States (52%), Israel (42%), Canada (3%), and 3% from Egypt, France, Greece, India, United Kingdom, and Australia were identified. A total of 57% were female and at account registration the median age was 57 years. A total of 126 patients had evaluable text data to search concepts being discussed. The PPRN platform identified 93% of the concepts from the conceptual model developed based on prior literature review. The most commonly reported symptoms were neuropathy, tiredness, nausea, back pain, fatigue, and bone pain. Back pain appeared as the most prominent symptom early in the disease and sometimes occurred prior to MM diagnosis. Tiredness, nausea, fatigue, and bone pain were frequently reported after MM diagnosis, with the start of treatment. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Patient-oriented social media platforms, such as Belong.life, can capture and contribute to a holistic vision of concepts surrounding patients' HRQoL. The ability to understand when a certain debilitating symptom appeared and to which sub-population of patients may allow for a personalized approach to treatment, improving adherence and quality of care as well as increasing patient well-being.","['1 Janssen Global Services, 700 US-202, Raritan, NJ, 08869, USA.

      Most population-based cancer databases lack information on metastatic recurrence. Electronic medical records (EMR) and cancer registries contain complementary information on cancer diagnosis, treatment and outcome, yet are rarely used synergistically. To construct a cohort of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients, we applied natural language processing techniques within a semisupervised machine learning framework to linked EMR-California Cancer Registry (CCR) data. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      We studied all female patients treated at Stanford Health Care with an incident breast cancer diagnosis from 2000 to 2014. Our database consisted of structured fields and unstructured free-text clinical notes from EMR, linked to CCR, a component of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program (SEER). We identified de novo MBC patients from CCR and extracted information on distant recurrences from patient notes in EMR. Furthermore, we trained a regularized logistic regression model for recurrent MBC classification and evaluated its performance on a gold standard set of 146 patients. Results:
      
    

    
      There were 11 459 breast cancer patients in total and the median follow-up time was 96.3 months. We identified 1886 MBC patients, 512 (27.1%) of whom were de novo MBC patients and 1374 (72.9%) were recurrent MBC patients. Our final MBC classifier achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.917, with sensitivity 0.861, specificity 0.878, and accuracy 0.870. Discussion and conclusion:
      
    

    
      To enable population-based research on MBC, we developed a framework for retrospective case detection combining EMR and CCR data. Our classifier achieved good AUC, sensitivity, and specificity without expert-labeled examples.","['1 Biomedical Informatics Training Program, Stanford University, Stanford, CA.', '2 Department of Biomedical Data Science, Stanford University, Stanford, CA.', '3 Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA.', '4 Department of Health Research and Policy, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA.', '5 Center for Biomedical Informatics Research, Stanford University, CA.', '6 Center for Population Health Sciences, Stanford University, CA.']","Albee Y Ling, Allison W Kurian, Jennifer L Caswell-Jin, George W Sledge Jr, Nigam H Shah, Suzanne R Tamang, ",JAMIA open,2019,SEER; cancer distant recurrence; electronic medical records; natural language processing; semi-supervised machine learning.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32025650
1279,Named entity recognition from Chinese adverse drug event reports with lexical feature based BiLSTM-CRF and tri-training,"Background:
      
    

    
      The Adverse Drug Event Reports (ADERs) from the spontaneous reporting system are important data sources for studying Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) as well as post-marketing pharmacovigilance. Apart from the conventional ADR information contained in the structured section of ADERs, more detailed information such as pre- and post- ADR symptoms, multi-drug usages and ADR-relief treatments are described in the free-text section, which can be mined through Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools. Objective:
      
    

    
      The goal of this study was to extract ADR-related entities from free-text section of Chinese ADERs, which can act as supplements for the information contained in structured section, so as to further assist in ADR evaluation. Methods:
      
    

    
      Three models of Conditional Random Field (CRF), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory-CRF (BiLSTM-CRF) and Lexical Feature based BiLSTM-CRF (LF-BiLSTM-CRF) were constructed to conduct Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks in free-text section of Chinese ADERs. A semi-supervised learning method of tri-training was applied on the basis of the three established models to give un-annotated raw data with reliable tags. Results:
      
    

    
      Among the three basic models, the LF-BiLSTM-CRF achieved the highest average F1 score of 94.35%. After the process of tri-training, almost half of the un-annotated cases were tagged with labels, and the performances of all the three models improved after iterative training. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The LF-BiLSTM-CRF model that we constructed could achieve a comparatively high F1 score, and the fusion of CRF, while BiLSTM-CRF and LF-BiLSTM-CRF in tri-training might further strengthen the reliability of predicted tags. The results suggested the usefulness of our methods in developing the specialized NER tools for identifying ADR-related information from Chinese ADERs.","['1 School of Science, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.', '2 Adverse Drug Reaction Monitoring Center of Wuxi, Wuxi, China.', '3 MandalaT Software Corporation, Wuxi, China.', '4 School of Science, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.

1280,Abnormal dynamic resting-state brain network organization in auditory verbal hallucination,"Auditory-verbal hallucinations (AVH) are a key symptom of schizophrenia. Recent neuroimaging studies examining dynamic functional connectivity suggest that disrupted dynamic interactions between brain networks characterize complex symptoms in mental illness including schizophrenia. Studying dynamic connectivity may be especially relevant for hallucinations, given their fluctuating phenomenology. Indeed, it remains unknown whether AVH in schizophrenia are directly related to altered dynamic connectivity within and between key brain networks involved in auditory perception and language, emotion processing, and top-down control. In this study, we used dynamic connectivity approaches including sliding window and k-means to examine dynamic interactions among brain networks in schizophrenia patients with and without a recent history of AVH. Dynamic brain network analysis revealed that patients with AVH spent less time in a 'network-antagonistic' brain state where the default mode network (DMN) and the language network were anti-correlated, and had lower probability to switch into this brain state. Moreover, patients with AVH showed a lower connectivity within the language network and the auditory network, and lower connectivity was observed between the executive control and the language networks in certain dynamic states. Our study provides the first neuroimaging evidence of altered dynamic brain networks for understanding neural mechanisms of AVH in schizophrenia. The findings may inform and further strengthen cognitive models of AVH that aid the development of new coping strategies for patients.","['1 Center for Brain Disorders and Cognitive Sciences, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China. h.geng@umcg.nl.', '2 Department of Biomedical Sciences of Cells and Systems, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands. h.geng@umcg.nl.', '3 Beijing Key Laboratory of Applied Experimental Psychology, Faculty of Psychology, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China. xupf@szu.edu.cn.', '4 Center for Emotion and Brain, Shenzhen Institute of Neuroscience, Shenzhen, China. xupf@szu.edu.cn.', '5 Great Bay Neuroscience and Technology Research Institute (Hong Kong), Kwun Tong, Hong Kong, China. xupf@szu.edu.cn.', '6 Department of Biomedical Sciences of Cells and Systems, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', '7 Center for Brain Disorders and Cognitive Sciences, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China.', '8 Center for Emotion and Brain, Shenzhen Institute of Neuroscience, Shenzhen, China.', '9 Sichuan Center of Applied Psychology, Chengdu Medical College, Chengdu, China.']","Haiyang Geng, Pengfei Xu, Iris E Sommer, Yue-Jia Luo, André Aleman, Branislava Ćurčić-Blake, ",Brain structure & function,2020,Auditory-verbal hallucinations; Default model network; Dynamic connectivity; Language network; Network-antagonistic state.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32813156

The capacity for combinatorial processing is present, in different degrees, in some mammals and birds. We used vibrational insects, Enchenopa treehoppers, to test the hypothesis of basic combinatorial processing against two competing hypotheses: beginning rule (where the early signal portions play a stronger role in acceptability) and no ordering rule (where the order of signal elements plays no role in signal acceptability). Enchenopa males use plant-borne vibrational signals that consist of a whine followed by pulses. We tested the above hypotheses with vibrational playback experiments in which we presented Enchenopa females with stimuli varying in signal element combinations. We monitored female responses to these playbacks with laser vibrometry. We found strong support for combinatorial processing in Enchenopa: in brief, females preferred natural-combination signals regardless of the beginning element and discriminated against reverse-order signals or individual elements. Finding support for the combinatorial rule hypothesis in insects suggests that this capability represents a common solution to the problems presented by complex communication.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Bretta Speck, Sara Seidita, Samuel Belo, Samuel Johnson, Caley Conley, Camille Desjonquères, Rafael L Rodríguez, ",The American naturalist,2020 Oct,communication; mate choice; phonology; signal processing; syntax; vibrational signaling.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32970471
1282,Multi-layer framework of identifying placenta related research towards Placenta Curated Research Dataset (PCRD) development for the PAT project,"Background:
      
    

    
      The placenta is a maternal-fetal organ that develops during pregnancy and provides nutrients, oxygen, and removal of waste products to the growing fetus. Better understanding of the placenta promises to help improve health of mothers and children, given its influence on health lasting a lifetime. However, the placenta is poorly understood due to its variability across different species and no live functions available after the baby is delivered. The Placenta Atlas Tool (PAT) project aims to leverage advanced computational approaches to meld numerous and diverse datasets into an integrated resource to encourage a ""systems biology"" approach for study of both normal and abnormal placental development and function throughout gestation. Methods:
      
    

    
      In this study, we introduced a multi-layer framework to automatically identify PAT relevant research from PubMed and develop a Placenta Curated Research Dataset (PCRD) to ultimately support placenta research. This framework functions by multiple well-known Natural Language Processing (NLP) components; including Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) based Naïve Bayes classifier, abstract based text similarity comparison and MeSH based article prioritization to systematically filter out PAT relevant research publications for further data curation. In addition, we developed a user-friendly web application to incorporate human judgement at the final stage of publication identification. Results:
      
    

    
      We obtained 22,047 articles from PubMed, and programmatically identified 6086 articles that are highly relevant to PAT via our framework. To assess performance of the framework, we manually reviewed a random set of articles by using our web tool. Based on our review, accuracy of article classification is greater than 90% and accuracy of prioritization is greater than 80%. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We developed a multi-layer publication identification framework to systematically identify PAT relevant publications from PubMed. This framework not only demonstrates good performance in identifying placenta related research, but also can be easily extended to support research in other scientific fields.","['1 Division of Pre-Clinical Innovation, National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD 20850, USA.

1283,Multiscale Computation and Dynamic Attention in Biological and Artificial Intelligence,"Biological and artificial intelligence (AI) are often defined by their capacity to achieve a hierarchy of short-term and long-term goals that require incorporating information over time and space at both local and global scales. More advanced forms of this capacity involve the adaptive modulation of integration across scales, which resolve computational inefficiency and explore-exploit dilemmas at the same time. Research in neuroscience and AI have both made progress towards understanding architectures that achieve this. Insight into biological computations come from phenomena such as decision inertia, habit formation, information search, risky choices and foraging. Across these domains, the brain is equipped with mechanisms (such as the dorsal anterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) that can represent and modulate across scales, both with top-down control processes and by local to global consolidation as information progresses from sensory to prefrontal areas. Paralleling these biological architectures, progress in AI is marked by innovations in dynamic multiscale modulation, moving from recurrent and convolutional neural networks-with fixed scalings-to attention, transformers, dynamic convolutions, and consciousness priors-which modulate scale to input and increase scale breadth. The use and development of these multiscale innovations in robotic agents, game AI, and natural language processing (NLP) are pushing the boundaries of AI achievements. By juxtaposing biological and artificial intelligence, the present work underscores the critical importance of multiscale processing to general intelligence, as well as highlighting innovations and differences between the future of biological and artificial intelligence.","['1 Center for Brain Science, RIKEN, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.', '2 Department of Psychology, University of Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, UK.']","Ryan Paul Badman, Thomas Trenholm Hills, Rei Akaishi, ",Brain sciences,2020,"artificial intelligence (AI); decision making, attention; environmental neuroscience; exploration-exploitation; information search; multiscale computation; prefrontal cortex.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32575758
1284,"Recent applications of deep learning and machine intelligence on in silico drug discovery: methods, tools and databases","The identification of interactions between drugs/compounds and their targets is crucial for the development of new drugs. In vitro screening experiments (i.e. bioassays) are frequently used for this purpose; however, experimental approaches are insufficient to explore novel drug-target interactions, mainly because of feasibility problems, as they are labour intensive, costly and time consuming. A computational field known as 'virtual screening' (VS) has emerged in the past decades to aid experimental drug discovery studies by statistically estimating unknown bio-interactions between compounds and biological targets. These methods use the physico-chemical and structural properties of compounds and/or target proteins along with the experimentally verified bio-interaction information to generate predictive models. Lately, sophisticated machine learning techniques are applied in VS to elevate the predictive performance. The objective of this study is to examine and discuss the recent applications of machine learning techniques in VS, including deep learning, which became highly popular after giving rise to epochal developments in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing. The past 3 years have witnessed an unprecedented amount of research studies considering the application of deep learning in biomedicine, including computational drug discovery. In this review, we first describe the main instruments of VS methods, including compound and protein features (i.e. representations and descriptors), frequently used libraries and toolkits for VS, bioactivity databases and gold-standard data sets for system training and benchmarking. We subsequently review recent VS studies with a strong emphasis on deep learning applications. Finally, we discuss the present state of the field, including the current challenges and suggest future directions. We believe that this survey will provide insight to the researchers working in the field of computational drug discovery in terms of comprehending and developing novel bio-prediction methods.","['1 Department of Computer Engineering, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey.', '2 Department of Computer Engineering, İskenderun Technical University, Hatay, Turkey.', '3 Cancer System Biology Laboratory (CanSyL), Graduate School of Informatics, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey.', '4 European Molecular Biology Laboratory, European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), Cambridge, Hinxton, UK.', '5 Cancer System Biology Laboratory (CanSyL), Graduate School of Informatics, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey and European Molecular Biology Laboratory, European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), Cambridge, Hinxton, UK.']","Ahmet Sureyya Rifaioglu, Heval Atas, Maria Jesus Martin, Rengul Cetin-Atalay, Volkan Atalay, Tunca Doğan, ",Briefings in bioinformatics,2019,compound and bioactivity databases; deep learning; drug-target interactions; gold-standard data sets; ligand-based VS and proteochemometric modelling; machine learning; virtual screening.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30084866
1285,Prevalence and incidence of clinical outcomes in patients presenting to secondary mental health care with mood instability and sleep disturbance,"Background:
      
    

    
      Mood instability and sleep disturbance are common symptoms in people with mental illness. Both features are clinically important and associated with poorer illness trajectories. We compared clinical outcomes in people presenting to secondary mental health care with mood instability and/or sleep disturbance with outcomes in people without either mood instability or sleep disturbance. Methods:
      
    

    
      Data were from electronic health records of 31,391 patients ages 16-65 years presenting to secondary mental health services between 2008 and 2016. Mood instability and sleep disturbance were identified using natural language processing. Prevalence of mood instability and sleep disturbance were estimated at baseline. Incidence rate ratios were estimates for clinical outcomes including psychiatric diagnoses, prescribed medication, and hospitalization within 2-years of presentation in persons with mood instability and/or sleep disturbance compared to individuals without either symptom. Results:
      
    

    
      Mood instability was present in 9.58%, and sleep disturbance in 26.26% of patients within 1-month of presenting to secondary mental health services. Compared with individuals without either symptom, those with mood instability and sleep disturbance showed significantly increased incidence of prescription of any psychotropic medication (incidence rate ratios [IRR] = 7.04, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 6.53-7.59), and hospitalization (IRR = 5.32, 95% CI 5.32, 4.67-6.07) within 2-years of presentation. Incidence rates of most clinical outcomes were considerably increased among persons with both mood instability and sleep disturbance, relative to persons with only one symptom. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Mood instability and sleep disturbance are present in a wide range of mental disorders, beyond those in which they are conventionally considered to be symptoms. They are associated with poor outcomes, particularly when they occur together. The poor prognosis associated with mood instability and sleep disorder may be, in part, because they are often treated as secondary symptoms. Mood instability and sleep disturbance need better recognition as clinical targets for treatment in their own right.","['1 Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, Warneford Hospital, OxfordOX3 7JX, United Kingdom.', '2 Division of Psychiatry, UCL, London, W1T 7NF, UK.', '3 Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust, OxfordOX3 7JX, United Kingdom.', '4 South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, Biomedical Research Center Nucleus, LondonSE5 8AF, United Kingdom.', ""5 Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, LondonWC2R 2LS, United Kingdom.""]","Keltie McDonald, Tanya Smith, Matthew Broadbent, Rashmi Patel, John R Geddes, Kate E A Saunders, ",European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists,2020,Electronic health records; epidemiology; mood; psychiatry; sleep.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32336304
1286,rawMSA: End-to-end Deep Learning using raw Multiple Sequence Alignments,"In the last decades, huge efforts have been made in the bioinformatics community to develop machine learning-based methods for the prediction of structural features of proteins in the hope of answering fundamental questions about the way proteins function and their involvement in several illnesses. The recent advent of Deep Learning has renewed the interest in neural networks, with dozens of methods being developed taking advantage of these new architectures. However, most methods are still heavily based pre-processing of the input data, as well as extraction and integration of multiple hand-picked, and manually designed features. Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSA) are the most common source of information in de novo prediction methods. Deep Networks that automatically refine the MSA and extract useful features from it would be immensely powerful. In this work, we propose a new paradigm for the prediction of protein structural features called rawMSA. The core idea behind rawMSA is borrowed from the field of natural language processing to map amino acid sequences into an adaptively learned continuous space. This allows the whole MSA to be input into a Deep Network, thus rendering pre-calculated features such as sequence profiles and other features calculated from MSA obsolete. We showcased the rawMSA methodology on three different prediction problems: secondary structure, relative solvent accessibility and inter-residue contact maps. We have rigorously trained and benchmarked rawMSA on a large set of proteins and have determined that it outperforms classical methods based on position-specific scoring matrices (PSSM) when predicting secondary structure and solvent accessibility, while performing on par with methods using more pre-calculated features in the inter-residue contact map prediction category in CASP12 and CASP13. Clearly demonstrating that rawMSA represents a promising development that can pave the way for improved methods using rawMSA instead of sequence profiles to represent evolutionary information in the coming years.

Some researchers have argued that AI will augment the capacities of physicians and increase their availability to provide empathy and other uniquely human forms of care to their patients. The human vulnerabilities experienced in the healthcare context raise the stakes of new technologies such as AI, and the human dimensions of AI in healthcare have particular significance for research in the humanities. This article explains four key areas of concern relating to AI and the role that medical/health humanities research can play in addressing them: definition and regulation of ""medical"" versus ""health"" data and apps; social determinants of health; narrative medicine; and technological mediation of care. Issues include data privacy and trust, flawed datasets and algorithmic bias, racial discrimination, and the rhetoric of humanism and disability. Through a discussion of potential humanities contributions to these emerging intersections with AI, this article will suggest future scholarly directions for the field.","['1 Medical Humanities Program and Department of English, Rice University, 6100 Main St., MS-30, Houston, TX, 77005, USA. kostherr@rice.edu.']","Kirsten Ostherr, ",The Journal of medical humanities,2020,Big data; Digital health; Health technology; Narrative medicine; Natural language processing; Social determinants of health.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32654043

Our primary objective was to determine and compare the accuracy of natural language processing and administrative data to manual chart review to identify dysphagia indications for EGD procedures within the national VA healthcare system. From 396,856 EGD notes identified from 2008-2014, we classified 119,920 as ""index"" procedures in 2010-2012. We compared the performance of our NLP to ICD codes to correctly identify dysphagia indications in the index EGD procedures and in repeat EGD procedures. We used linked pathology data to describe esophageal biopsies performed during these EGDs. NLP performed significantly better and identified significantly more index and repeat EGD procedures with dysphagia indications than ICD codes, which has critical implications for determining appropriateness of EGD procedures.","['1 University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.', '2 George E.

1289,A pan-cancer somatic mutation embedding using autoencoders,"Background:
      
    

    
      Next generation sequencing instruments are providing new opportunities for comprehensive analyses of cancer genomes. The increasing availability of tumor data allows to research the complexity of cancer disease with machine learning methods. The large available repositories of high dimensional tumor samples characterised with germline and somatic mutation data requires advance computational modelling for data interpretation. In this work, we propose to analyze this complex data with neural network learning, a methodology that made impressive advances in image and natural language processing. Results:
      
    

    
      Here we present a tumor mutation profile analysis pipeline based on an autoencoder model, which is used to discover better representations of lower dimensionality from large somatic mutation data of 40 different tumor types and subtypes. Kernel learning with hierarchical cluster analysis are used to assess the quality of the learned somatic mutation embedding, on which support vector machine models are used to accurately classify tumor subtypes. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The learned latent space maps the original samples in a much lower dimension while keeping the biological signals from the original tumor samples. This pipeline and the resulting embedding allows an easier exploration of the heterogeneity within and across tumor types and to perform an accurate classification of tumor samples in the pan-cancer somatic mutation landscape.","['1 Instituto de Investigación en Biomedicina de Buenos Aires (IBioBA)-CONICET-Partner Institute of the Max Planck Society, Godoy Cruz 2390, Buenos Aires, C1425FQD, Argentina.', '2 Institut Charles Delaunay, Universite de Technologie de Troyes, 12 Rue Marie Curie, Troyes, 10300, France.', '3 Universidad Tecnologica Nacional, Facultad Regional Buenos Aires, Av.

1290,BERT-based Ranking for Biomedical Entity Normalization,"Developing high-performance entity normalization algorithms that can alleviate the term variation problem is of great interest to the biomedical community. Although deep learning-based methods have been successfully applied to biomedical entity normalization, they often depend on traditional context-independent word embeddings. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), BERT for Biomedical Text Mining (BioBERT) and BERT for Clinical Text Mining (ClinicalBERT) were recently introduced to pre-train contextualized word representation models using bidirectional Transformers, advancing the state-of-the-art for many natural language processing tasks. In this study, we proposed an entity normalization architecture by fine-tuning the pre-trained BERT / BioBERT / ClinicalBERT models and conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the pre-trained models for biomedical entity normalization using three different types of datasets. Our experimental results show that the best fine-tuned models consistently outperformed previous methods and advanced the state-of-the-art for biomedical entity normalization, with up to 1.17% increase in accuracy.","['1 School of Biomedical Informatics, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, USA.']","Zongcheng Ji, Qiang Wei, Hua Xu, ",AMIA Joint Summits on Translational Science proceedings.

1291,Natural Language Processing Accurately Measures Adherence to Best Practice Guidelines for Palliative Care in Trauma,"Context:
      
    

    
      The Trauma Quality Improvement Program Best Practice Guidelines recommend palliative care (PC) concurrent with restorative treatment for patients with life-threatening injuries. Measuring PC delivery is challenging: administrative data are nonspecific, and manual review is time intensive. Objectives:
      
    

    
      To identify PC delivery to patients with life-threatening trauma and compare the performance of natural language processing (NLP), a form of computer-assisted data abstraction, to administrative coding and gold standard manual review. Methods:
      
    

    
      Patients 18 years and older admitted with life-threatening trauma were identified from two Level I trauma centers (July 2016-June 2017). Four PC process measures were examined during the trauma admission: code status clarification, goals-of-care discussion, PC consult, and hospice assessment. The performance of NLP and administrative coding were compared with manual review. Multivariable regression was used to determine patient and admission factors associated with PC delivery. Results:
      
    

    
      There were 76,791 notes associated with 2093 admissions. NLP identified PC delivery in 33% of admissions compared with 8% using administrative coding. Using NLP, code status clarification was most commonly documented (27%), followed by goals-of-care discussion (18%), PC consult (4%), and hospice assessment (4%). Compared with manual review, NLP performed more than 50 times faster and had a sensitivity of 93%, a specificity of 96%, and an accuracy of 95%. Administrative coding had a sensitivity of 21%, a specificity of 92%, and an accuracy of 68%. Factors associated with PC delivery included older age, increased comorbidities, and longer intensive care unit stay. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      NLP performs with similar accuracy with manual review but with improved efficiency. NLP has the potential to accurately identify PC delivery and benchmark performance of best practice guidelines.","[""1 The Center for Surgery and Public Health, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA; Department of Surgery, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA.

      Artificial intelligence (AI) is used in various urological conditions such as urolithiasis, pediatric urology, urogynecology, benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), renal transplant, and uro-oncology. The various models of AI and its application in urology subspecialties are reviewed and discussed. Material and methods:
      
    

    
      Search strategy was adapted to identify and review the literature pertaining to the application of AI in urology using the keywords ""urology,"" ""artificial intelligence,"" ""machine learning,"" ""deep learning,"" ""artificial neural networks,"" ""computer vision,"" and ""natural language processing"" were included and categorized. Review articles, editorial comments, and non-urologic studies were excluded. Results:
      
    

    
      The article reviewed 47 articles that reported characteristics and implementation of AI in urological cancer. In all cases with benign conditions, artificial intelligence was used to predict outcomes of the surgical procedure. In urolithiasis, it was used to predict stone composition, whereas in pediatric urology and BPH, it was applied to predict the severity of condition. In cases with malignant conditions, it was applied to predict the treatment response, survival, prognosis, and recurrence on the basis of the genomic and biomarker studies. These results were also found to be statistically better than routine approaches. Application of radiomics in classification and nuclear grading of renal masses, cystoscopic diagnosis of bladder cancers, predicting Gleason score, and magnetic resonance imaging with computer-assisted diagnosis for prostate cancers are few applications of AI that have been studied extensively.

      The use of antipsychotic drugs in dementia has been reported to be associated with increased risk of cerebrovascular events and mortality. There is an international drive to reduce the use of these agents in patients with dementia and to improve the safety of prescribing and monitoring in this area. Objectives:
      
    

    
      The aim of this project was to use enhanced automated regular feedback of information from electronic health records to improve the quality of antipsychotic prescribing and monitoring in people with dementia. Methods:
      
    

    
      The South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (SLaM) incorporated antipsychotic monitoring forms into its electronic health records. The SLaM Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) platform provides researcher access to de-identified health records, and natural language processing is used in CRIS to derive structured data from unstructured free text, including recorded diagnoses and medication. Algorithms were thus developed to ascertain patients with dementia receiving antipsychotic treatment and to determine whether monitoring forms had been completed. We used two improvement plan-do-study-act cycles to improve the accuracy of the algorithm for automated evaluation and provided monthly feedback on team performance. Results:
      
    

    
      A steady increase in antipsychotic monitoring form completion was observed across the study period. The percentage of our sample with a completed antipsychotic monitoring form more than doubled from October 2017 (22%) to January 2019 (58%). Conclusion:

      Nephrology research is expanding, and harnessing the much-needed information and data for the practice of evidence-based medicine is becoming more challenging. In this study, we used the natural language processing and text mining approach to mitigate some of these challenges. Methods:
      
    

    
      We analyzed 17,412 abstracts from the top-10 nephrology journals over 10 years (2007-2017) by using latent semantic analysis and topic analysis. Results:
      
    

    
      The analyses revealed 10 distinct topics (T) for nephrology research ranging from basic science studies, using animal modeling (T-1), to dialysis vascular access-related issues -(T-10). The trend analyses indicated that while the majority of topics stayed relatively stable, some of the research topics experienced increasing popularity over time such as studies focusing on mortality and survival (T-4) and Patient-related Outcomes and Perspectives of Clinicians (T-5). However, some research topics such as studies focusing on animal modeling (T-1), predictors of acute kidney injury, and dialysis access (T-10) exhibited a downward trend.

      We lack reliable methods for identifying patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP) at increased risk for pancreatic cancer. We aimed to identify radiographic parameters associated with pancreatic cancer in this population. Methods:
      
    

    
      We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with suspected CP within an integrated healthcare system in Southern California in 2006-2015. Patients were identified by a diagnostic code and confirmed by imaging findings (parenchymal calcification, ductal stones, glandular atrophy, pseudocyst, main duct dilatation, duct irregularity, abnormal side branch, or stricture) defined by the natural language processing of radiographic reports. We used Cox regression to determine the relationship of smoking, alcohol use, acute pancreatitis, diabetes, body mass index, and imaging features with the risk of incident pancreatic cancer at least 1 year after abnormal pancreas imaging. Results:
      
    

    
      We identified 1,766 patients with a diagnostic code and an imaging feature for CP with a median follow-up of 4.5 years. There were 46 incident pancreatic cancer cases. Factors that predicted incident pancreatic cancer after 1-year of follow-up included obesity (hazard ratio 2.7, 95% confidence interval: 1.2-6.1) and duct dilatation (hazard ratio 10.5, 95% confidence limit: 4.0-27). Five-year incidence of pancreatic cancer in this population with duct dilatation was 6.3%. Discussion:

      We present the development and validation of a portable NLP approach for automated surveillance of SSIs. Summary of background data:
      
    

    
      The surveillance of SSIs is labor-intensive limiting the generalizability and scalability of surgical quality surveillance programs. Methods:
      
    

    
      We abstracted patient clinical text notes after surgical procedures from 2 independent healthcare systems using different electronic healthcare records. An SSI detected as part of the American College of Surgeons' National Surgical Quality Improvement Program was used as the reference standard. We developed a rules-based NLP system (Easy Clinical Information Extractor [CIE]-SSI) for operative event-level detection of SSIs using an training cohort (4574 operative events) from 1 healthcare system and then conducted internal validation on a blind cohort from the same healthcare system (1850 operative events) and external validation on a blind cohort from the second healthcare system (15,360 operative events). EasyCIE-SSI performance was measured using sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver-operating-curve (AUC). Results:
      
    

    
      The prevalence of SSI was 4% and 5% in the internal and external validation corpora. In internal validation, EasyCIE-SSI had a sensitivity, specificity, AUC of 94%, 88%, 0.912 for the detection of SSI, respectively. In external validation, EasyCIE-SSI had sensitivity, specificity, AUC of 79%, 92%, 0.852 for the detection of SSI, respectively.

      Efficient capture of routine clinical care and patient outcomes is needed at a population-level, as is evidence on important treatment-related side effects and their effect on well-being and clinical outcomes. The increasing availability of electronic health records (EHR) offers new opportunities to generate population-level patient-centered evidence on oncologic care that can better guide treatment decisions and patient-valued care. Methods:
      
    

    
      This study includes patients seeking care at an academic medical center, 2008 to 2018. Digital data sources are combined to address missingness, inaccuracy, and noise common to EHR data. Clinical concepts were identified and extracted from EHR unstructured data using natural language processing (NLP) and machine/deep learning techniques. All models are trained, tested, and validated on independent data samples using standard metrics. Results:
      
    

    
      We provide use cases for using EHR data to assess guideline adherence and quality measurements among patients with cancer. Pretreatment assessment was evaluated by guideline adherence and quality metrics for cancer staging metrics. Our studies in perioperative quality focused on medications administered and guideline adherence. Patient outcomes included treatment-related side effects and patient-reported outcomes. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Advanced technologies applied to EHRs present opportunities to advance population-level quality assessment, to learn from routinely collected clinical data for personalized treatment guidelines, and to augment epidemiologic and population health studies.

1299,Delineating functional segregations of the human middle temporal gyrus with resting-state functional connectivity and coactivation patterns,"Although the middle temporal gyrus (MTG) has been parcellated into subregions with distinguished anatomical connectivity patterns, whether the structural topography of MTG can inform functional segregations of this area remains largely unknown. Accumulating evidence suggests that the brain's underlying organization and function can be directly and effectively delineated with resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) by identifying putative functional boundaries between cortical areas. Here, RSFC profiles were used to explore functional segregations of the MTG and defined four subregions from anterior to posterior in two independent datasets, which showed a similar pattern with MTG parcellation scheme obtained using anatomical connectivity. The functional segregations of MTG were further supported by whole brain RSFC, coactivation, and specific RFSC, and coactivation mapping. Furthermore, the fingerprint with predefined 10 networks and functional characterizations of each subregion using meta-analysis also identified functional distinction between subregions. The specific connectivity analysis and functional characterization indicated that the bilateral most anterior subregions mainly participated in social cognition and semantic processing; the ventral middle subregions were involved in social cognition in left hemisphere and auditory processing in right hemisphere; the bilateral ventro-posterior subregions participated in action observation, whereas the left subregion was also involved in semantic processing; both of the dorsal subregions in superior temporal sulcus were involved in language, social cognition, and auditory processing. Taken together, our findings demonstrated MTG sharing similar structural and functional topographies and provide more detailed information about the functional organization of the MTG, which may facilitate future clinical and cognitive research on this area.","['1 Institute of Biomedical and Health Engineering, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen, China.', '2 University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', '3 Radiology Department, Shenzhen Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, Shenzhen, China.', '4 Key Laboratory for NeuroInformation of the Ministry of Education, School of Life Science and Technology, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.']","Jinping Xu, Hanqing Lyu, Tian Li, Ziyun Xu, Xianjun Fu, Fucang Jia, Jiaojian Wang, Qingmao Hu, ",Human brain mapping,2019,coactivation connectivity; connectivity-based parcellation; middle temporal gyrus; resting-state functional connectivity.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31423713

1301,LMTRDA: Using logistic model tree to predict MiRNA-disease associations by fusing multi-source information of sequences and similarities,"Emerging evidence has shown microRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in human disease research. Identifying potential association among them is significant for the development of pathology, diagnose and therapy. However, only a tiny portion of all miRNA-disease pairs in the current datasets are experimentally validated. This prompts the development of high-precision computational methods to predict real interaction pairs. In this paper, we propose a new model of Logistic Model Tree for predicting miRNA-Disease Association (LMTRDA) by fusing multi-source information including miRNA sequences, miRNA functional similarity, disease semantic similarity, and known miRNA-disease associations. In particular, we introduce miRNA sequence information and extract its features using natural language processing technique for the first time in the miRNA-disease prediction model. In the cross-validation experiment, LMTRDA obtained 90.51% prediction accuracy with 92.55% sensitivity at the AUC of 90.54% on the HMDD V3.0 dataset. To further evaluate the performance of LMTRDA, we compared it with different classifier and feature descriptor models. In addition, we also validate the predictive ability of LMTRDA in human diseases including Breast Neoplasms, Breast Neoplasms and Lymphoma. As a result, 28, 27 and 26 out of the top 30 miRNAs associated with these diseases were verified by experiments in different kinds of case studies. These experimental results demonstrate that LMTRDA is a reliable model for predicting the association among miRNAs and diseases.","['1 Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Science, Urumqi, China.', '2 School of Information and Control Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, China.', '3 Department of Electrical Computer and Telecommunications Engineering Technology, Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, United States of America.', '4 Xiangya School of Public Health, Central South University, Changsha, China.']","Lei Wang, Zhu-Hong You, Xing Chen, Yang-Ming Li, Ya-Nan Dong, Li-Ping Li, Kai Zheng, ",PLoS computational biology,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30917115
1302,Implementing Artificial Intelligence and Digital Health in Resource-Limited Settings? Top 10 Lessons We Learned in Congenital Heart Defects and Cardiology,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the key drivers of digital health. Digital health and AI applications in medicine and biology are emerging worldwide, not only in resource-rich but also resource-limited regions. AI predates to the mid-20th century, but the current wave of AI builds in part on machine learning (ML), big data, and algorithms that can learn from massive amounts of online user data from patients or healthy persons. There are lessons to be learned from AI applications in different medical specialties and across developed and resource-limited contexts. A case in point is congenital heart defects (CHDs) that continue to plague sub-Saharan Africa, which calls for innovative approaches to improve risk prediction and performance of the available diagnostics. Beyond CHDs, AI in cardiology is a promising context as well. The current suite of digital health applications in CHD and cardiology include complementary technologies such as neural networks, ML, natural language processing and deep learning, not to mention embedded digital sensors. Algorithms that build on these advances are beginning to complement traditional medical expertise while inviting us to redefine the concepts and definitions of expertise in molecular diagnostics and precision medicine. We examine and share here the lessons learned in current attempts to implement AI and digital health in CHD for precision risk prediction and diagnosis in resource-limited settings. These top 10 lessons on AI and digital health summarized in this expert review are relevant broadly beyond CHD in cardiology and medical innovations. As with AI itself that calls for systems approaches to data capture, analysis, and interpretation, both developed and developing countries can usefully learn from their respective experiences as digital health continues to evolve worldwide.","['1 Division of Human Genetics, Department of Pathology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa.', '2 Institute for Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa.', '3 School of Medical Sciences, Department of Medical Biochemistry, University of Cape Coast, Cape Coast, Ghana.', '4 Department of Mathematics and Computer Sciences, Faculty of Sciences, University of Kinshasa, Kinshasa, D.R.

      We identified the methods used and determined the roles of electronic health records (EHRs) in detecting and assessing adverse drug events (ADEs) in the ambulatory setting. Methods:
      
    

    
      We performed a systematic literature review by searching PubMed and Google Scholar for studies on ADEs detected in the ambulatory setting involving any EHR use published before June 2017. We extracted study characteristics from included studies related to ADE detection methods for analysis. Results:
      
    

    
      We identified 30 studies that evaluated ADEs in an ambulatory setting with an EHR. In 27 studies, EHRs were used only as the data source for ADE identification. In two studies, the EHR was used as both a data source and to deliver decision support to providers during order entry. In one study, the EHR was a source of data and generated patient safety reports that researchers used in the process of identifying ADEs. Methods of identification included manual chart review by trained nurses, pharmacists, and/or physicians; prescription review; computer monitors; electronic triggers; International Classification of Diseases codes; natural language processing of clinical notes; and patient phone calls and surveys. Seven studies provided examples of search phrases, laboratory values, and rules used to identify ADEs. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The majority of studies examined used EHRs as sources of data for ADE detection. This retrospective approach is appropriate to measure incidence rates of ADEs but not adequate to detect preventable ADEs before patient harm occurs. New methods involving computer monitors and electronic triggers will enable researchers to catch preventable ADEs and take corrective action.","['1 Tulane University School of Medicine, Tulane University, New Orleans, Louisiana, United States.', '2 Department of Global Biostatistics and Data Science, Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, Tulane University, New Orleans, Louisiana, United States.']","Chenchen Feng, David Le, Allison B McCoy, ",Applied clinical informatics,2019 Jan,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30786301
1304,LBERT: Lexically-aware Transformers based Bidirectional Encoder Representation model for learning Universal Bio-Entity Relations,"Motivation:
      
    

    
      Natural Language Processing techniques are constantly being advanced to accommodate the influx of data as well as to provide exhaustive and structured knowledge dissemination. Within the biomedical domain, relation detection between bio-entities known as the Biomedical relation extraction (BRE) task has a critical function in knowledge structuring. Although recent advances in deep learning-based biomedical domain embedding have improved BRE predictive analytics, these works are often task selective or employ external knowledge-based pre/post processing. In addition, deep learning-based models do not account for local syntactic contexts, which have improved data representation in many kernel classifier-based models. In this study, we propose a universal BRE model, i.e. LBERT, which is a Lexically-aware Transformer-based Bidirectional Encoder Representation model, and which explores both local and global contexts representations for sentence level classification tasks. Results:
      
    

    
      This paper presents one of the most exhaustive BRE studies ever conducted over five different bio-entity relation types. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning models in protein-protein (PPI), drug-drug (DDI) and protein-bio-entity (REL) relation classification tasks by 0.02%, 11.2% and 41.4% respectively. LBERT representations show a statistically significant improvement over BioBERT in detecting true bio-entity relation for large corpora like PPI. Our ablation studies clearly indicate the contribution of the lexical features and distance-adjusted attention in improving prediction performance by learning additional local semantic context along with bi-directionally learned global context.

1305,Limited alignment of publicly competitive disease funding with disease burden in Japan,"Objective:
      
    

    
      The need to align investments in health research and development (R&D) with public health needs is one of the most important public health challenges in Japan. We examined the alignment of disease-specific publicly competitive R&D funding to the disease burden in the country. Methods:
      
    

    
      We analyzed publicly available data on competitive public funding for health in 2015 and 2016 and compared it to disability-adjusted life year (DALYs) in 2016, which were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2017 study. Their alignment was assessed as a percentage distribution among 22 GBD disease groups. Funding was allocated to the 22 disease groups based on natural language processing, using textual information such as project title and abstract for each research project, while considering for the frequency of information. Results:
      
    

    
      Total publicly competitive funding in health R&D in 2015 and 2016 reached 344.1 billion JPY (about 3.0 billion USD) for 32,204 awarded projects. About 49.5% of the funding was classifiable for disease-specific projects. Five GDB disease groups were significantly and relatively well-funded compared to their contributions to Japan's DALY, including neglected tropical diseases and malaria (funding vs DALY = 1.7% vs 0.0%, p<0.01) and neoplasms (28.5% vs 19.2%, p<0.001). In contrast, four GDB disease groups were significantly under-funded, including cardiovascular diseases (8.0% vs 14.8%, p<0.001) and musculoskeletal disorders (1.0% vs 11.9%, p<0.001). These percentages do not include unclassifiable funding. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      While caution is necessary as this study was not able to consider public in-house funding and the methodological uncertainties could not be ruled out, the analysis may provide a snapshot of the limited alignment between publicly competitive disease-specific funding and the disease burden in the country. The results call for greater management over the allocation of scarce resources on health R&D. DALYs will serve as a crucial, but not the only, consideration in aligning Japan's research priorities with the public health needs. In addition, the algorithms for natural language processing used in this study require continued efforts to improve accuracy.","['1 Department of Global Health Policy, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', '2 Department of Health Policy and Management, School of Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.', '3 Epidemiology and Prevention Group, Center for Public Health Sciences, National Cancer Center, Tokyo, Japan.', ""4 Graduate School of Public Health, St. Luke's International University, Tokyo, Japan."", '5 Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.']","Shuhei Nomura, Daisuke Yoneoka, Shiori Tanaka, Ryoko Makuuchi, Haruka Sakamoto, Aya Ishizuka, Haruyo Nakamura, Anna Kubota, Kenji Shibuya, ",PloS one,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32040510
1306,Quality of Documentation of Contrast Agent Allergies in Electronic Health Records,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      To describe and appraise contrast agent allergy documentation in the electronic health record (EHR). Methods:
      
    

    
      We systematically identified medical imaging drugs and class terms in an integrated EHR allergy repository for patients seen at a large health care system between 2000 and 2013. Structured and free-text contrast allergy records were normalized and categorized by inciting agent and nature of adverse reaction. Allergen records were evaluated by their level of specificity. Reaction records were evaluated by whether the reaction was known or unknown and whether known reactions would be categorized as allergic-like or physiologic. Results:
      
    

    
      Among 2.7 million patients, we identified 36,144 patients (1.3%) with at least one of 40,669 contrast allergy records associated with 49,000 reactions. Contrast allergens were more likely than other allergens to be entered as free text (15.2% versus 6.3%; odds ratio 2.69, 95% confidence interval 2.61-2.76). There were 1,305 unique contrast allergen records, which we grouped into 141 concepts. Most contrast allergen records were ambiguous contrast concepts (69.1%), rather than imaging modality-specific class terms (19.4%) or specific contrast agents (11.5%). Contrast reactions were occasionally entered as free text (24.8%), which together with structured entries were grouped into 183 concepts. A known reaction was documented in 71.8% of cases; however, 12.2% were non-allergic-like reactions. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Contrast allergy records in EHRs are diverse and commonly low quality. Continued EHR enhancements and training are needed to support contrast allergy documentation to facilitate improved patient care and medical research.","['1 Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', '2 Department of Pharmacy and Therapeutics, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', '3 Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.', '4 Clinical & Quality Analysis, Partners HealthCare System, Somerville, Massachusetts.', ""5 Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.

1307,"Unsupervised low-dimensional vector representations for words, phrases and text that are transparent, scalable, and produce similarity metrics that are not redundant with neural embeddings","Neural embeddings are a popular set of methods for representing words, phrases or text as a low dimensional vector (typically 50-500 dimensions). However, it is difficult to interpret these dimensions in a meaningful manner, and creating neural embeddings requires extensive training and tuning of multiple parameters and hyperparameters. We present here a simple unsupervised method for representing words, phrases or text as a low dimensional vector, in which the meaning and relative importance of dimensions is transparent to inspection. We have created a near-comprehensive vector representation of words, and selected bigrams, trigrams and abbreviations, using the set of titles and abstracts in PubMed as a corpus. This vector is used to create several novel implicit word-word and text-text similarity metrics. The implicit word-word similarity metrics correlate well with human judgement of word pair similarity and relatedness, and outperform or equal all other reported methods on a variety of biomedical benchmarks, including several implementations of neural embeddings trained on PubMed corpora. Our implicit word-word metrics capture different aspects of word-word relatedness than word2vec-based metrics and are only partially correlated (rho = 0.5-0.8 depending on task and corpus). The vector representations of words, bigrams, trigrams, abbreviations, and PubMed title + abstracts are all publicly available from http://arrowsmith.psych.uic.edu/arrowsmith_uic/word_similarity_metrics.html for release under CC-BY-NC license. Several public web query interfaces are also available at the same site, including one which allows the user to specify a given word and view its most closely related terms according to direct co-occurrence as well as different implicit similarity metrics.","['1 Department of Psychiatry and Psychiatric Institute, University of Illinois College of Medicine, Chicago, IL 60612, USA.

1308,Extracting chemical-protein interactions from biomedical literature via granular attention based recurrent neural networks,"Background and objective:
      
    

    
      The extraction of interactions between chemicals and proteins from biomedical literature is important for many biomedical tasks such as drug discovery and precision medicine. In the existing systems, the methods achieving competitive results are combined of several models or implemented in multi-stage, and they are challenged by high cost because numerous external features are employed. These problems can be avoided by deep learning algorithms, but the performance of the deep learning based models is limited by inadequate exploration of the information. Our goal is to devise a system to improve the performance of the automatic extraction between chemical entities and protein entities from biomedical literature. Methods:
      
    

    
      In this paper, we propose a model based on recurrent neural networks integrating granular attention mechanism. The granular attention can explore the inner information of the context vectors, which are represented in multiple dimensions that play different roles in the extraction of the interactions. Furthermore, we employ Swish activation function in the neural networks for the chemical-protein interactions extraction task for the first time. Results:
      
    

    
      The proposed method is evaluated on BioCreative VI chemical-protein track test corpus. The experimental results show that this method achieves an F-score of 65.14%, which is 1.04% higher than the state-of-the-art system. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The model synthesizing recurrent neural networks and granular attention mechanism, exploring the inner information of the context vectors, can improve the extraction performance without extra hand-crafted features. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model is promising for further study on the interaction extraction between chemicals and proteins.","['1 School of Computer Science and Technology, Dalian University of Technology, 116024 Dalian, China.

1309,Machine Learning Can Improve Estimation of Surgical Case Duration: A Pilot Study,"Operating room (OR) utilization is a significant determinant of hospital profitability. One aspect of this is surgical scheduling, which depends on accurate predictions of case duration. This has been done historically by either the surgeon based on personal experience, or by an electronic health record (EHR) based on averaged historical means for case duration. Here, we compare the predicted case duration (pCD) accuracy of a novel machine-learning algorithm over a 3-month period. A proprietary machine learning algorithm was applied utilizing operating room factors such as patient demographic data, pre-surgical milestones, and hospital logistics and compared to that of a conventional EHR. Actual case duration and pCD (Leap Rail vs EHR) was obtained at one institution over the span of 3 months. Actual case duration was defined as time between patient entry into an OR and time of exit. pCD was defined as case time allotted by either Leap Rail or EHR. Cases where Leap Rail was unable to generate a pCD were excluded. A total of 1059 surgical cases were performed during the study period, with 990 cases being eligible for the study. Over all sub-specialties, Leap Rail showed a 7 min improvement in absolute difference between pCD and actual case duration when compared to conventional EHR (p < 0.0001). In aggregate, the Leap Rail method resulted in a 70% reduction in overall scheduling inaccuracy. Machine-learning algorithms are a promising method of increasing pCD accuracy and represent one means of improving OR planning and efficiency.","[""1 Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative and Pain Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, 02115, USA."", '2 Leap Rail Inc, Houston, TX, USA.', '3 NorthBay Healthcare, Fairfield, CA, USA.', '4 Department of Anesthesiology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA.', ""5 Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative and Pain Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, 02115, USA. rurman@bwh.harvard.edu."", ""6 Center for Perioperative Research, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA. rurman@bwh.harvard.edu.""]","Justin P Tuwatananurak, Shayan Zadeh, Xinling Xu, Joshua A Vacanti, William R Fulton, Jesse M Ehrenfeld, Richard D Urman, ",Journal of medical systems,2019,Case duration; Efficiency; Model; Natural language processing; Operating room; Prediction.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30656433

      The objective of this technical study was to evaluate the performance of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based system for clinical trials matching for a cohort of lung cancer patients in an Australian cancer hospital. Methods:
      
    

    
      A lung cancer cohort was derived from clinical data from patients attending an Australian cancer hospital. Ten phases I-III clinical trials registered on clinicaltrials.gov and open to lung cancer patients at this institution were utilized for assessments. The trial matching system performance was compared to a gold standard established by clinician consensus for trial eligibility. Results:
      
    

    
      The study included 102 lung cancer patients. The trial matching system evaluated 7252 patient attributes (per patient median 74, range 53-100) against 11 467 individual trial eligibility criteria (per trial median 597, range 243-4132). Median time for the system to run a query and return results was 15.5 s (range 7.2-37.8). In establishing the gold standard, clinician interrater agreement was high (Cohen's kappa 0.70-1.00). On a per-patient basis, the performance of the trial matching system for eligibility was as follows: accuracy, 91.6%; recall (sensitivity), 83.3%; precision (positive predictive value), 76.5%; negative predictive value, 95.7%; and specificity, 93.8%. Discussion and conclusion:
      
    

    
      The AI-based clinical trial matching system allows efficient and reliable screening of cancer patients for clinical trials with 95.7% accuracy for exclusion and 91.6% accuracy for overall eligibility assessment; however, clinician input and oversight are still required.

1311,Impact of a Health Information Technology-Enabled Appropriate Use Criterion on Utilization of Emergency Department CT for Renal Colic,"Objective:
      
    

    
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of an appropriate use criterion (AUC) for renal colic based on local best practice, implemented as electronic clinical decision support (CDS), on the emergency department (ED) use of CT for patients with suspected nephrolithiasis. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      This retrospective cohort study was performed in the EDs of a level I trauma center (study site) and local comparable hospital (control site). An AUC for patients younger than 50 years with a history of uncomplicated nephrolithiasis presenting with renal colic was developed by an interdisciplinary emergency medicine, emergency radiology, and urology team and embedded as CDS. AUC-consistent CT of ureter requests received no CDS alert. Otherwise, the orderer was alerted to consider a trial of symptomatic control or discharge without CT. A natural language processing tool mined ED notes for visits in September 2010-February 2012 (before AUC implementation) and April 2013-September 2014 (1 year after implementation) for concept unique identifiers of flank tenderness or renal or ureteral pain. Manual review excluded noneligible cases; the others were reviewed by a multidisciplinary team. Chi-square tests were used to assess for CT rate differences, the primary outcome. Results:
      
    

    
      The final sample included 467 patients (194 study site) before and 306 (88 study site) after AUC implementation. The study site's CT of ureter rate decreased from 23.7% (46/194) to 14.8% (13/88) (p = 0.03) after implementation of the AUC. The rate at the control site remained unchanged, 49.8% (136/273) versus 48.2% (105/218) (p = 0.3). Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Implementing an AUC based on local best practice as CDS may effectively curb potential imaging overuse in a subset of ED patients with renal colic unlikely to have a complicated course or alternative dangerous diagnosis.","[""1 1 Center for Evidence-Based Imaging, Brigham and Women's Hospital, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115."", ""2 2 Department of Radiology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA."", '3 3 Department of Emergency Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA.', '4 4 Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', ""5 5 Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA."", ""6 6 Department of Emergency Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA."", ""7 7 Department of Urology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA.""]","Ali S Raja, Sarvenaz Pourjabbar, Ivan K Ip, Christopher W Baugh, Aaron D Sodickson, Michael O'Leary, Ramin Khorasani, ",AJR.

1312,Thyroid Ultrasound Reports: Will TI-RADS Improve Natural Language Processing Capture of Critical Thyroid Nodule Features?,"Background:
      
    

    
      Critical thyroid nodule features are contained in unstructured ultrasound (US) reports. The Thyroid Imaging, Reporting, and Data System (TI-RADS) uses five key features to risk stratify nodules and recommend appropriate intervention. This study aims to analyze the quality of US reporting and the potential benefit of Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems in efficiently capturing TI-RADS features from text reports. Materials and method:
      
    

    
      This retrospective study used free-text thyroid US reports from an academic center (A) and community hospital (B). Physicians created ""gold standard"" annotations by manually extracting TI-RADS features and clinical recommendations from reports to determine how often they were included. Similar annotations were created using an automated NLP system and compared with the gold standard. Results:
      
    

    
      Two hundred eighty-two reports contained 409 nodules at least 1-cm in maximum diameter. The gold standard identified three nodules (0.7%) which contained enough information to calculate a complete TI-RADS score. Shape was described most often (92.7% of nodules), whereas margins were described least often (11%). A median number of two TI-RADS features are reported per nodule. The NLP system was significantly less accurate than the gold standard in capturing echogenicity (27.5%) and margins (58.9%). One hundred eight nodule reports (26.4%) included clinical management recommendations, which were included more often at site A than B (33.9 versus 17%, P < 0.05). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      These results suggest a gap between current US reporting styles and those needed to implement TI-RADS and achieve NLP accuracy. Synoptic reporting should prompt more complete thyroid US reporting, improved recommendations for intervention, and better NLP performance.","['1 Division of Endocrine Surgery at University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Department of Surgery, Madison, Wisconsin.

1313,The machine giveth and the machine taketh away: a parrot attack on clinical text deidentified with hiding in plain sight,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Clinical corpora can be deidentified using a combination of machine-learned automated taggers and hiding in plain sight (HIPS) resynthesis. The latter replaces detected personally identifiable information (PII) with random surrogates, allowing leaked PII to blend in or ""hide in plain sight."" We evaluated the extent to which a malicious attacker could expose leaked PII in such a corpus. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      We modeled a scenario where an institution (the defender) externally shared an 800-note corpus of actual outpatient clinical encounter notes from a large, integrated health care delivery system in Washington State. These notes were deidentified by a machine-learned PII tagger and HIPS resynthesis. A malicious attacker obtained and performed a parrot attack intending to expose leaked PII in this corpus. Specifically, the attacker mimicked the defender's process by manually annotating all PII-like content in half of the released corpus, training a PII tagger on these data, and using the trained model to tag the remaining encounter notes. The attacker hypothesized that untagged identifiers would be leaked PII, discoverable by manual review. We evaluated the attacker's success using measures of leak-detection rate and accuracy. Results:
      
    

    
      The attacker correctly hypothesized that 211 (68%) of 310 actual PII leaks in the corpus were leaks, and wrongly hypothesized that 191 resynthesized PII instances were also leaks. One-third of actual leaks remained undetected. Discussion and conclusion:
      
    

    
      A malicious parrot attack to reveal leaked PII in clinical text deidentified by machine-learned HIPS resynthesis can attenuate but not eliminate the protective effect of HIPS deidentification.","['1 Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute, Seattle, Washington, USA.', '2 Privacy Analytics Inc, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', '3 Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', '4 Department of Biostatistics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', '5 Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', '6 The MITRE Corp, Bedford, Massachusetts, USA.']","David S Carrell, David J Cronkite, Muqun Rachel Li, Steve Nyemba, Bradley A Malin, John S Aberdeen, Lynette Hirschman, ",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2019,"deidentification; machine learning; natural language processing, patient data privacy; patient privacy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31390016

      Natural language processing (NLP) of health-related data is still an expertise demanding, and resource expensive process. We created a novel, open source rapid clinical text mining system called NimbleMiner. NimbleMiner combines several machine learning techniques (word embedding models and positive only labels learning) to facilitate the process in which a human rapidly performs text mining of clinical narratives, while being aided by the machine learning components. Objective:
      
    

    
      This manuscript describes the general system architecture and user Interface and presents results of a case study aimed at classifying fall-related information (including fall history, fall prevention interventions, and fall risk) in homecare visit notes. Methods:
      
    

    
      We extracted a corpus of homecare visit notes (n = 1,149,586) for 89,459 patients from a large US-based homecare agency. We used a gold standard testing dataset of 750 notes annotated by two human reviewers to compare the NimbleMiner's ability to classify documents regarding whether they contain fall-related information with a previously developed rule-based NLP system. Results:
      
    

    
      NimbleMiner outperformed the rule-based system in almost all domains. The overall F- score was 85.8% compared to 81% by the rule based-system with the best performance for identifying general fall history (F = 89% vs. F = 85.1% rule-based), followed by fall risk (F = 87% vs. F = 78.7% rule-based), fall prevention interventions (F = 88.1% vs. F = 78.2% rule-based) and fall within 2 days of the note date (F = 83.1% vs. F = 80.6% rule-based). The rule-based system achieved slightly better performance for fall within 2 weeks of the note date (F = 81.9% vs. F = 84% rule-based). Discussion & conclusions:
      
    

    
      NimbleMiner outperformed other systems aimed at fall information classification, including our previously developed rule-based approach. These promising results indicate that clinical text mining can be implemented without the need for large labeled datasets necessary for other types of machine learning.

1315,Natural Language Processing Improves Detection of Nonsevere Hypoglycemia in Medical Records Versus Coding Alone in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes but Does Not Improve Prediction of Severe Hypoglycemia Events: An Analysis Using the Electronic Medical Record in a Large Health System,"Objective:
      
    

    
      To determine if natural language processing (NLP) improves detection of nonsevere hypoglycemia (NSH) in patients with type 2 diabetes and no NSH documentation by diagnosis codes and to measure if NLP detection improves the prediction of future severe hypoglycemia (SH). Research design and methods:
      
    

    
      From 2005 to 2017, we identified NSH events by diagnosis codes and NLP. We then built an SH prediction model. Results:
      
    

    
      There were 204,517 patients with type 2 diabetes and no diagnosis codes for NSH. Evidence of NSH was found in 7,035 (3.4%) of patients using NLP. We reviewed 1,200 of the NLP-detected NSH notes and confirmed 93% to have NSH. The SH prediction model (C-statistic 0.806) showed increased risk with NSH (hazard ratio 4.44; P < 0.001). However, the model with NLP did not improve SH prediction compared with diagnosis code-only NSH. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Detection of NSH improved with NLP in patients with type 2 diabetes without improving SH prediction.","['1 Department of Internal Medicine and Center for Value-Based Care Research, Cleveland Clinic Community Care, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH misraa@ccf.org.', '2 Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', '3 Novo Nordisk, Inc., Plainsboro, NJ.', '4 Department of Endocrinology, Endocrinology & Metabolism Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.']","Anita D Misra-Hebert, Alex Milinovich, Alex Zajichek, Xinge Ji, Todd D Hobbs, Wayne Weng, Paul Petraro, Sheldon X Kong, Michelle Mocarski, Rahul Ganguly, Janine M Bauman, Kevin M Pantalone, Robert S Zimmerman, Michael W Kattan, ",Diabetes care,2020 Aug,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32414887
1316,Annotating and detecting phenotypic information for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"Objectives:
      
    

    
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) phenotypes cover a range of lung abnormalities. To allow text mining methods to identify pertinent and potentially complex information about these phenotypes from textual data, we have developed a novel annotated corpus, which we use to train a neural network-based named entity recognizer to detect fine-grained COPD phenotypic information. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      Since COPD phenotype descriptions often mention other concepts within them (proteins, treatments, etc.), our corpus annotations include both outermost phenotype descriptions and concepts nested within them. Our neural layered bidirectional long short-term memory conditional random field (BiLSTM-CRF) network firstly recognizes nested mentions, which are fed into subsequent BiLSTM-CRF layers, to help to recognize enclosing phenotype mentions. Results:
      
    

    
      Our corpus of 30 full papers (available at: http://www.nactem.ac.uk/COPD) is annotated by experts with 27 030 phenotype-related concept mentions, most of which are automatically linked to UMLS Metathesaurus concepts. When trained using the corpus, our BiLSTM-CRF network outperforms other popular approaches in recognizing detailed phenotypic information. Discussion:
      
    

    
      Information extracted by our method can facilitate efficient location and exploration of detailed information about phenotypes, for example, those specifically concerning reactions to treatments. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The importance of our corpus for developing methods to extract fine-grained information about COPD phenotypes is demonstrated through its successful use to train a layered BiLSTM-CRF network to extract phenotypic information at various levels of granularity. The minimal human intervention needed for training should permit ready adaption to extracting phenotypic information about other diseases.","['1 National Centre for Text Mining, School of Computer Science, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', '2 Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', '3 Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust; and School of Health Sciences, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', '4 College of Medical and Dental Sciences, Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, Centre for Computational Biology, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', '5 Institute of Translational Medicine, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK.', '6 MRC Health Data Research UK (HDR UK).', '7 NIHR Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre, Birmingham, UK.', '8 NIHR Surgical Reconstruction and Microbiology Research Centre, Birmingham, UK.', '9 NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Birmingham, UK.', '10 School of Health Sciences, Centre for Life and Sport Sciences, Birmingham City University, Birmingham, UK.']","Meizhi Ju, Andrea D Short, Paul Thompson, Nawar Diar Bakerly, Georgios V Gkoutos, Loukia Tsaprouni, Sophia Ananiadou, ",JAMIA open,2019,chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; information extraction; natural language processing; phenotype; text mining.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31984360
1317,Recent advances in Swedish and Spanish medical entity recognition in clinical texts using deep neural approaches,"Background:
      
    

    
      Text mining and natural language processing of clinical text, such as notes from electronic health records, requires specific consideration of the specialized characteristics of these texts. Deep learning methods could potentially mitigate domain specific challenges such as limited access to in-domain tools and data sets. Methods:
      
    

    
      A bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory network is applied to clinical notes in Spanish and Swedish for the task of medical named entity recognition. Several types of embeddings, both generated from in-domain and out-of-domain text corpora, and a number of generation and combination strategies for embeddings have been evaluated in order to investigate different input representations and the influence of domain on the final results. Results:
      
    

    
      For Spanish, a micro averaged F1-score of 75.25 was obtained and for Swedish, the corresponding score was 76.04. The best results for both languages were achieved using embeddings generated from in-domain corpora extracted from electronic health records, but embeddings generated from related domains were also found to be beneficial. Conclusions:

1320,Evaluation of Use of Technologies to Facilitate Medical Chart Review,"Introduction:
      
    

    
      While medical chart review remains the gold standard to validate health conditions or events identified in administrative claims and electronic health record databases, it is time consuming, expensive and can involve subjective decisions. Aim:
      
    

    
      The aim of this study was to describe the landscape of technology-enhanced approaches that could be used to facilitate medical chart review within and across distributed data networks. Method:
      
    

    
      We conducted a semi-structured survey regarding processes for medical chart review with organizations that either routinely do medical chart review or use technologies that could facilitate chart review. Results:
      
    

    
      Fifteen out of 17 interviewed organizations used optical character recognition (OCR) or natural language processing (NLP) in their chart review process. None used handwriting recognition software. While these organizations found OCR and NLP to be useful for expediting extraction of useful information from medical charts, they also mentioned several challenges. Quality of medical scans can be variable, interfering with the accuracy of OCR. Additionally, linguistic complexity in medical notes and heterogeneity in reporting templates used by different healthcare systems can reduce the transportability of NLP-based algorithms to diverse healthcare settings. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      New technologies including OCR and NLP are currently in use by various organizations involved in medical chart review. While technology-enhanced approaches could scale up capacity to validate key variables and make information about important clinical variables from medical records more generally available for research purposes, they often require considerable customization when employed in a distributed data environment with multiple, diverse healthcare settings.","[""1 Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 1620 Tremont Street, Suite 3030, Boston, MA, 02120, USA. lstraub@bwh.harvard.edu."", ""2 Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 1620 Tremont Street, Suite 3030, Boston, MA, 02120, USA."", '3 Department of Population Medicine, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', '4 Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD, USA.', ""5 Division of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.""]","Loreen Straub, Joshua J Gagne, Judith C Maro, Michael D Nguyen, Nicolas Beaulieu, Jeffrey S Brown, Adee Kennedy, Margaret Johnson, Adam Wright, Li Zhou, Shirley V Wang, ",Drug safety,2019 Sep,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31111340

1322,The Tool for the Automatic Analysis of Cohesion 2.0: Integrating semantic similarity and text overlap,"This article introduces the second version of the Tool for the Automatic Analysis of Cohesion (TAACO 2.0). Like its predecessor, TAACO 2.0 is a freely available text analysis tool that works on the Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems; is housed on a user's hard drive; is easy to use; and allows for batch processing of text files. TAACO 2.0 includes all the original indices reported for TAACO 1.0, but it adds a number of new indices related to local and global cohesion at the semantic level, reported by latent semantic analysis, latent Dirichlet allocation, and word2vec. The tool also includes a source overlap feature, which calculates lexical and semantic overlap between a source and a response text (i.e., cohesion between the two texts based measures of text relatedness). In the first study in this article, we examined the effects that cohesion features, prompt, essay elaboration, and enhanced cohesion had on expert ratings of text coherence, finding that global semantic similarity as reported by word2vec was an important predictor of coherence ratings. A second study was conducted to examine the source and response indices. In this study we examined whether source overlap between the speaking samples found in the TOEFL-iBT integrated speaking tasks and the responses produced by test-takers was predictive of human ratings of speaking proficiency. The results indicated that the percentage of keywords found in both the source and response and the similarity between the source document and the response, as reported by word2vec, were significant predictors of speaking quality. Combined, these findings help validate the new indices reported for TAACO 2.0.","['1 Department of Applied Linguistics/ESL, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA, USA. sacrossley@gmail.com.', ""2 Department of Second Language Studies, University of Hawai'i at Manoa, Honolulu, Hawaii, USA."", '3 Department of Computer Sciences, Politehnica University of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania.']","Scott A Crossley, Kristopher Kyle, Mihai Dascalu, ",Behavior research methods,2019 Feb,Coherence; Cohesion; Essay quality; Natural language processing; Speaking proficiency.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30298264
1323,Terminologies augmented recurrent neural network model for clinical named entity recognition,"Objective:
      
    

    
      We aimed to enhance the performance of a supervised model for clinical named-entity recognition (NER) using medical terminologies. In order to evaluate our system in French, we built a corpus for 5 types of clinical entities. Methods:
      
    

    
      We used a terminology-based system as baseline, built upon UMLS and SNOMED. Then, we evaluated a biGRU-CRF, and a hybrid system using the prediction of the terminology-based system as feature for the biGRU-CRF. In French, we built APcNER, a corpus of 147 documents annotated for 5 entities (Drug names, Signs or symptoms, Diseases or disorders, Diagnostic procedures or lab tests and Therapeutic procedures). We evaluated each NER systems using exact and partial match definition of F-measure for NER. The APcNER contains 4,837 entities, which took 28 h to annotate. The inter-annotator agreement as measured by Cohen's Kappa was substantial for non-exact match (Κ = 0.61) and moderate considering exact match (Κ = 0.42). In English, we evaluated the NER systems on the i2b2-2009 Medication Challenge for Drug name recognition, which contained 8,573 entities for 268 documents, and i2b2-small a version reduced to match APcNER number of entities. Results:
      
    

    
      For drug name recognition on both i2b2-2009 and APcNER, the biGRU-CRF performed better that the terminology-based system, with an exact-match F-measure of 91.1% versus 73% and 81.9% versus 75% respectively. For i2b2-small and APcNER, the hybrid system outperformed the biGRU-CRF, with an exact-match F-measure of 87.8% versus 85.6% and 86.4% versus 81.9% respectively. On APcNER corpus, the micro-average F-measure of the hybrid system on the 5 entities was 69.5% in exact match and 84.1% in non-exact match. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      APcNER is a French corpus for clinical-NER of five types of entities which covers a large variety of document types. The extension of the supervised model with terminology has allowed an easy increase in performance, especially for rare entities, and established near state of the art results on the i2b2-2009 corpus.","['1 Paris University, Paris, France; AP-HP, DSI-WIND, Paris, France.', '2 AP-HP, DSI-WIND, Paris, France; LIMSI, CNRS, Univ.

1324,The common patterns of abundance: the log series and Zipf's law,"In a language corpus, the probability that a word occurs n times is often proportional to 1/ n 2. Assigning rank, s, to words according to their abundance, log s vs log n typically has a slope of minus one. That simple Zipf's law pattern also arises in the population sizes of cities, the sizes of corporations, and other patterns of abundance. By contrast, for the abundances of different biological species, the probability of a population of size n is typically proportional to 1/ n, declining exponentially for larger n, the log series pattern. This article shows that the differing patterns of Zipf's law and the log series arise as the opposing endpoints of a more general theory. The general theory follows from the generic form of all probability patterns as a consequence of conserved average values and the associated invariances of scale. To understand the common patterns of abundance, the generic form of probability distributions plus the conserved average abundance is sufficient. The general theory includes cases that are between the Zipf and log series endpoints, providing a broad framework for analyzing widely observed abundance patterns.","['1 Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California, Irvine, CA, 92697-2525, USA.']","Steven A Frank, ",F1000Research,2019,demography; ecology; linguistics; probability theory; scaling patterns.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31069071
1325,Ontology-driven aspect-based sentiment analysis classification: An infodemiological case study regarding infectious diseases in Latin America,"Infodemiology is the process of mining unstructured and textual data so as to provide public health officials and policymakers with valuable information regarding public health. The appearance of this new data source, which was previously unimaginable, has opened up a new way in which to improve public health systems, resulting in better communication policies and better detection systems. However, the unstructured nature of the Internet, along with the complexity of the infectious disease domain, prevents the information extracted from being easily understood. Moreover, when dealing with languages other than English, for which some of the most common Natural Language Processing resources are not available, the correct exploitation of this data becomes even more difficult. We intend to fill these gaps proposing an ontology-driven aspect-based sentiment analysis with which to measure the general public's opinions as regards infectious diseases when expressed in Spanish by employing a case study of tweets concerning the Zika, Dengue and Chikungunya viruses in Latin America. Our proposal is based on two technologies. We first use ontologies in order to model the infectious disease domain with concepts such as risks, symptoms, transmission methods or drugs, among other concepts. We then measure the relationship between these concepts in order to determine the degree to which one concept influences other concepts. This new information is subsequently applied in order to build an aspect-based sentiment analysis model based on statistical and linguistic features. This is done by applying deep-learning models. Our proposal is available on a web platform, where users can see the sentiment for each concept at a glance and analyse how each concept influences the sentiment of the others.","['1 Departamento de Informática y Sistemas, Universidad de Murcia, 30100, Murcia, Spain.']","José Antonio García-Díaz, Mar Cánovas-García, Rafael Valencia-García, ",Future generations computer systems : FGCS,2020 Nov,Aspect-based sentiment analysis; Deep learning; Infodemiology; Ontologies.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32572291
1326,Supporting the use of standardized nursing terminologies with automatic subject heading prediction: a comparison of sentence-level text classification methods,"Objective:
      
    

    
      This study focuses on the task of automatically assigning standardized (topical) subject headings to free-text sentences in clinical nursing notes. The underlying motivation is to support nurses when they document patient care by developing a computer system that can assist in incorporating suitable subject headings that reflect the documented topics. Central in this study is performance evaluation of several text classification methods to assess the feasibility of developing such a system. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      Seven text classification methods are evaluated using a corpus of approximately 0.5 million nursing notes (5.5 million sentences) with 676 unique headings extracted from a Finnish university hospital. Several of these methods are based on artificial neural networks. Evaluation is first done in an automatic manner for all methods, then a manual error analysis is done on a sample. Results:
      
    

    
      We find that a method based on a bidirectional long short-term memory network performs best with an average recall of 0.5435 when allowed to suggest 1 subject heading per sentence and 0.8954 when allowed to suggest 10 subject headings per sentence. However, other methods achieve comparable results. The manual analysis indicates that the predictions are better than what the automatic evaluation suggests. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The results indicate that several of the tested methods perform well in suggesting the most appropriate subject headings on sentence level. Thus, we find it feasible to develop a text classification system that can support the use of standardized terminologies and save nurses time and effort on care documentation.","['1 Department of Future Technologies, University of Turku, Turku, Finland.', '2 Department of Nursing Science, University of Turku, Turku, Finland.', '3 Department of Nursing, Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland.']","Hans Moen, Kai Hakala, Laura-Maria Peltonen, Henry Suhonen, Filip Ginter, Tapio Salakoski, Sanna Salanterä, ",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2020,clinical decision support; electronic health records; natural language processing; nursing documentation; text classification.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31605490

1328,Is it dangerous? The role of an emotional visual search strategy and threat-relevant training in the detection of guns and knives,"Counter-terrorism strategies rely on the assumption that it is possible to increase threat detection by providing explicit verbal instructions to orient people's attention to dangerous objects and hostile behaviours in their environment. Nevertheless, whether verbal cues can be used to enhance threat detection performance under laboratory conditions is currently unclear. In Experiment 1, student participants were required to detect a picture of a dangerous or neutral object embedded within a visual search display on the basis of an emotional strategy 'is it dangerous?' or a semantic strategy 'is it an object?'. The results showed a threat superiority effect that was enhanced by the emotional visual search strategy. In Experiment 2, whilst trainee police officers displayed a greater threat superiority effect than student controls, both groups benefitted from performing the task under the emotional than semantic visual search strategy. Manipulating situational threat levels (high vs. low) in the experimental instructions had no effect on visual search performance. The current findings provide new support for the language-as-context hypothesis. They are also consistent with a dual-processing account of threat detection involving a verbally mediated route in working memory and the deployment of a visual template developed as a function of training.","['1 School of Natural Sciences and Psychology, Liverpool John Moores University, UK.', '2 Department of Psychology, Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières, Québec, Canada.']","Ljubica Damjanovic, Alexandre Williot, Isabelle Blanchette, ","British journal of psychology (London, England : 1953)",2020 May,dangerous objects; language as context; policing; threat detection; visual search.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31190378

1330,"mRNA Vaccine Era-Mechanisms, Drug Platform and Clinical Prospection","Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)-based drugs, notably mRNA vaccines, have been widely proven as a promising treatment strategy in immune therapeutics. The extraordinary advantages associated with mRNA vaccines, including their high efficacy, a relatively low severity of side effects, and low attainment costs, have enabled them to become prevalent in pre-clinical and clinical trials against various infectious diseases and cancers. Recent technological advancements have alleviated some issues that hinder mRNA vaccine development, such as low efficiency that exist in both gene translation and in vivo deliveries. mRNA immunogenicity can also be greatly adjusted as a result of upgraded technologies. In this review, we have summarized details regarding the optimization of mRNA vaccines, and the underlying biological mechanisms of this form of vaccines.

1331,Epidemiology of Prehospital Care at the San Diego (USA) - Tijuana (Mexico) International Border Crossing,"Introduction: San Diego has one of the busiest international land border crossings in the world. The epidemiology of prehospital care at the San Diego (California, USA)-Tijuana (Baja California, Mexico) border crossings are previously unreported. Investigators sought to describe prehospital care provided at the San Diego border crossings. Methods: This was a cross-sectional, retrospective data collection from April 2014 to March 2017 evaluating prehospital provider (PHP) contacts at 2 international border crossing addresses in San Diego. The 9-1-1 dispatch center and first response were provided by a single municipal fire agency with ambulance transportation provided by a contracting private agency. Patient dispatch data and electronic patient care records were queried for patient demographics, PHP arrival time, incident complaint, assessment narrative, and treatments provided. Natural language processing techniques were applied to map the narrative to the National Library of Medicine's Unified Medical Language System. Descriptive analysis was performed in the R software program. Results: A total of 6,261 PHP patient contacts were made at the 2 border crossings during the study period. 87% of the calls were at the San Ysidro border crossing compared to 13% at Otay Mesa. The population, composed of 50.8% males, had ages ranging from 0 days-103 years old, with a median age of 45 years old. There were 606 (9.7%) pediatric patients (<18 years) and 1,416 (22.6%) geriatric patients (>65 years). The top 3 incident complaints were respiratory distress (830, 10.8%), blunt trauma (827, 10.7%), and abdominal pain (814, 10.6%); and, the top 3 medications provided were oxygen (481, 7.7%), normal saline (393, 6.3%), and ondansetron (352, 5.6%). Conclusion: This was the first study of PHP assessment and care at the San Diego-Tijuana border crossings. We found a large diversity in patient ages. Respiratory distress and blunt trauma were the most frequent complaints and oxygen was the most frequent medication. The busiest day of the week was Sunday, and the busiest month of the year was July.

1333,Natural Language Processing of Serum Protein Electrophoresis Reports in the Veterans Affairs Health Care System,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) is a clinical tool used to screen for monoclonal gammopathy, thus it is a critical tool in the evaluation of patients with multiple myeloma. However, SPEP laboratory results are usually returned as short text reports, which are not amenable to simple computerized processing for large-scale studies. We applied natural language processing (NLP) to detect monoclonal gammopathy in SPEP laboratory results and compared its performance at multiple hospitals using both a rules-based manual system and a machine-learning algorithm. Methods:
      
    

    
      We used the data from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse, which comprises data from 20 million unique individuals. SPEP reports were collected from July to December 2015 at 5 Veterans Affairs Medical Centers. Of these reports, we annotated the presence or absence of monoclonal gammopathy in 300 reports. We applied a machine learning-based NLP and a manual rules-based NLP to detect monoclonal gammopathy in SPEP reports at each of the hospitals, then applied the model from 1 hospital to each of the other hospitals. Results:
      
    

    
      The learning system achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.997, and the rules-based system achieved an accuracy of 0.99. When a model trained on 1 hospital's data was applied to a different hospital, however, accuracy varied greatly, and the learning-based models performed better than the rules-based model. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Binary classification of short clinical texts such as SPEP reports may be a particularly attractive target on which to train highly accurate NLP systems.","['1 Department of Internal Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA.', '2 Michael E.

1334,Strong Immune Responses Induced by Direct Local Injections of Modified mRNA-Lipid Nanocomplexes,"In vitro transcribed mRNAs hold the promises of many medical applications in disease prevention and treatment, such as replacement or supplement of missing or inadequately expressed endogenous proteins and as preventive vaccines against infectious diseases, therapeutic vaccines, or other protein-based biopharmaceutics for cancer therapy. A safe and efficient delivery system for mRNA is crucial to the success of mRNA therapeutic applications. In this study, we report that InstantFECT, a liposome-based transfection reagent, can pack pseudouridine-incorporated mRNA into nanocomplexes that are highly efficient in mediating in vivo transfection in multiple organs after local delivery. High levels of expression of EGFP and luciferase reporters after intratumoral and intramuscular injections were observed, which lasted for up to 96 hrs. Immunogenicity of antigens encoded by mRNA delivered with nanocomplex was investigated by subcutaneous delivery of modified mRNAs encoding Staphylococcus aureus adenosine synthase A (AdsA) and a model tumor-associated antigen ovalbumin (OVA). Strong T cell responses were provoked by both mRNAs delivered. Therapeutic and protective treatment with the OVA mRNA-liposome nanocomplex significantly inhibited B16-OVA tumor progression and increased mouse survival. There was no sign of obvious toxicity related to the treatment both in tissue culture and in mice. An intravenous injection of the same dosage of the modified mRNA-lipid nanocomplex showed minimal transfection in major organs, indicating an excellent safety feature as the gene transfer occurred only at the injection sites, whereas intravenous (i.v.) injection with the same amount of mRNA complexed with a commercial transfection reagent Trans-IT showed luciferase expression in the spleen. In summary, InstantFECT cationic liposomes provide a safe and efficient in vivo locoregional delivery of mRNA and could be a useful tool for basic research and for the development of mRNA-based therapies.","['1 School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR.', '2 Shenzhen Institute of Synthetic Biology, Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen, Guangdong, P.R.

Utilization of various forms of social media has been a key interest in consumer health informatics (CHI). To reveal the information needs of autism-affected users, this study centers on the research of users' interactions and information sharing within autism communities on social media. It aims to understand how autism-affected users utilize support groups on Facebook by applying natural language process (NLP) techniques to unstructured health data in social media. An interactive visualization method (pyLDAvis) was employed to evaluate produced models and visualize the inter-topic distance maps. The revealed topics (e.g., parenting, education, behavior traits) identify issues that individuals with autism were concerned about on a daily basis and how they addressed such concerns in the form of group communication. In addition to general social support, disease-specific information, collective coping strategies, and emotional support were provided as well by group members based on similar personal experiences. This study concluded that Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is feasible and appropriated to derive topics (focus) from messages posted to the autism support groups on Facebook. The revealed topics help healthcare professionals (content providers) understand autism from users' perspectives and provide better patient communications.","['1 School of Information Management, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Data Engineering and Knowledge Service, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210023, China.', '2 School of Information Studies, University of Wisconsin Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI 53211, USA.', '3 College of Health Sciences, University of Wisconsin Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI 53211, USA.']","Yuehua Zhao, Jin Zhang, Min Wu, ",International journal of environmental research and public health,2019,autism; consumer health informatics; natural language processing (NLP); online support groups.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31795451
1336,Anti-cancer effect of GV1001 for prostate cancer: function as a ligand of GnRHR,"GV1001, a 16-amino acid fragment of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase catalytic subunit (hTERT), has been developed as an injectable formulation of cancer vaccine. Here, we revealed for the first time that GV1001 is a novel ligand for gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRHR). The docking prediction for GV1001 against GnRHR showed high binding affinity. Binding of GV1001 to GnRHR stimulated the Gαs-coupled cAMP signaling pathway and antagonized Gαq-coupled Ca2+ release by leuprolide acetate (LA), a GnRHR agonist. Repeated injection of GV1001 attenuated both serum testosterone level and seminal vesicle weight via desensitization of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. We then tested whether GV1001 has an inhibitory effect on tumor growth of LNCaP cells, androgen receptor-positive human prostate cancer (PCa) cells. GV1001 significantly inhibited tumor growth and induced apoptosis in LNCaP-implanted xenografts. Interestingly, mRNA expressions of matrix metalloproteinase 2 and matrix metalloproteinase 9 were suppressed by GV1001, but not by LA. Moreover, GV1001 significantly inhibited the proliferation and migration of PCa cells and induced apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that GV1001 functions as a biased GnRHR ligand to selectively stimulate the Gαs/cAMP pathway, with anti-proliferative and anti-migratory effects on human PCa.","['1 College of Pharmacy and Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', '2 Gachon Institute of Pharmaceutical Science & Department of Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Gachon University, Incheon, Republic of Korea.', '3 Department of Biochemistry, All India Institute of Medical Science, Jodhpur, India.', '4 College of Pharmacy, Dongguk University, Goyang, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea.', '5 College of Veterinary Medicine, Chonbuk National University, Iksan, Republic of Korea.']","Ji Won Kim, Dharmendra K Yadav, Soo Jin Kim, Moo-Yeol Lee, Jung-Min Park, Bum Seok Kim, Mi-Hyun Kim, Hyeung-Geun Park, Keon Wook Kang, ",Endocrine-related cancer,2019 Feb,GV1001; GnRH; cancer vaccine; hTERT; prostate cancer.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30400054
1337,Virtual Standardized Patient Simulation: Case Development and Pilot Application to High-Value Care,"Introduction:
      
    

    
      High-value care (HVC) suggests that good history taking and physical examination should lead to risk stratification that drives the use or withholding of diagnostic testing. This study describes the development of a series of virtual standardized patient (VSP) cases and provides preliminary evidence that supports their ability to provide experiential learning in HVC. Methods:
      
    

    
      This pilot study used VSPs, or natural language processing-based patient avatars, within the USC Standard Patient platform. Faculty consensus was used to develop the cases, including the optimal diagnostic testing strategies, treatment options, and scored content areas. First-year resident physician learners experienced two 90-minute didactic sessions before completing the cases in a computer laboratory, using typed text to interview the avatar for history taking, then completing physical examination, differential diagnosis, diagnostic testing, and treatment modules for each case. Learners chose a primary and 2 alternative ""possible"" diagnoses from a list of 6 to 7 choices, diagnostic testing options from an extensive list, and treatments from a brief list ranging from 6 to 9 choices. For the history-taking module, both faculty and the platform scored the learners, and faculty assessed the appropriateness of avatar responses. Four randomly selected learner-avatar interview transcripts for each case were double rated by faculty for interrater reliability calculations. Intraclass correlations were calculated for interrater reliability, and Spearman ρ was used to determine the correlation between the platform and faculty ranking of learners' history-taking scores. Results:
      
    

    
      Eight VSP cases were experienced by 14 learners. Investigators reviewed 112 transcripts (4646 learner query-avatar responses). Interrater reliability means were 0.87 for learner query scoring and 0.83 for avatar response. Mean learner success for history taking was scored by the faculty at 57% and by the platform at 51% (ρ correlation of learner rankings = 0.80, P = 0.02). The mean avatar appropriate response rate was 85.6% for all cases. Learners chose the correct diagnosis within their 3 choices 82% of the time, ordered a median (interquartile range) of 2 (2) unnecessary tests and completed 56% of optimal treatments. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our avatar appropriate response rate was similar to past work using similar platforms. The simulations give detailed insights into the thoroughness of learner history taking and testing choices and with further refinement should support learning in HVC.","['1 From Jump Simulation (W.F.B., T.J.L., M.J.M., J.L.F, D.M.K., K.M.M., R.A.E.-A., M.A.); OSF Healthcare (W.F.B., T.J.L., M.J.M., J.L.F., J.S.M., J.T.T., D.M.K., K.M.M., R.A.E.-A., D.N.M., M.A.); University of Illinois College of Medicine at Peoria (W.F.B., T.J.L., M.J.M., J.T.T., D.N.M., M.A.), Peoria, IL; The Institute for Creative Technologies (T.B.T.), Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA; and Uniformed Services University (T.B.T.), Bethesda, MD.']","William F Bond, Teresa J Lynch, Matthew J Mischler, Jessica L Fish, Jeremy S McGarvey, Jason T Taylor, Dipen M Kumar, Kyle M Mou, Rebecca A Ebert-Allen, Dilip N Mahale, Thomas B Talbot, Meenakshy Aiyer, ",Simulation in healthcare : journal of the Society for Simulation in Healthcare,2019 Aug,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31116172
1338,A stacked convolutional neural network for detecting the resource tweets during a disaster,"Social media platform like Twitter is one of the primary sources for sharing real-time information at the time of events such as disasters, political events, etc. Detecting the resource tweets during a disaster is an essential task because tweets contain different types of information such as infrastructure damage, resources, opinions and sympathies of disaster events, etc. Tweets are posted related to Need and Availability of Resources (NAR) by humanitarian organizations and victims. Hence, reliable methodologies are required for detecting the NAR tweets during a disaster. The existing works don't focus well on NAR tweets detection and also had poor performance. Hence, this paper focus on detection of NAR tweets during a disaster. Existing works often use features and appropriate machine learning algorithms on several Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Recently, there is a wide use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in text classification problems. However, it requires a large amount of manual labeled data. There is no such large labeled data is available for NAR tweets during a disaster. To overcome this problem, stacking of Convolutional Neural Networks with traditional feature based classifiers is proposed for detecting the NAR tweets. In our approach, we propose several informative features such as aid, need, food, packets, earthquake, etc. are used in the classifier and CNN. The learned features (output of CNN and classifier with informative features) are utilized in another classifier (meta-classifier) for detection of NAR tweets. The classifiers such as SVM, KNN, Decision tree, and Naive Bayes are used in the proposed model. From the experiments, we found that the usage of KNN (base classifier) and SVM (meta classifier) with the combination of CNN in the proposed model outperform the other algorithms. This paper uses 2015 and 2016 Nepal and Italy earthquake datasets for experimentation. The experimental results proved that the proposed model achieves the best accuracy compared to baseline methods.","['1 Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli, India.']","Sreenivasulu Madichetty, Sridevi M, ",Multimedia tools and applications,2020,CNN; Disaster; NAR; Stacking.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32994750

      In 2013, the Dahlgren Memorial Library (DML) at the Georgetown University Medical Center began using text mining software to enable its clinical informationists to quickly retrieve specific, relevant information from MEDLINE abstracts while on patient rounds. Description:
      
    

    
      In 2013, DML licensed the use of the Linguamatics I2E text-mining program, and DML's clinical informationist began using it to text mine MEDLINE abstracts on patient rounds. In 2015, DML installed I2E on a server at Georgetown and negotiated with Elsevier to obtain the right to download and text mine the full text of clinical journals in ScienceDirect to support clinical decision making. In 2016, the license agreements for the New England Journal of Medicine and the BMJ platform were modified to allow text mining. In 2018, PubMed Central open access content was added to the Linguamatics license. Results:
      
    

    
      DML's informationists found that they were able to quickly find useful information that was not retrievable by traditional methods, and clinicians reported the information was valuable. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The ability to text mine MEDLINE abstracts and selected journal articles on patient rounds has allowed DML's clinical informationists to quickly search large amounts of medical literature that can be used to answer physicians' clinical questions.

1340,Extracting comprehensive clinical information for breast cancer using deep learning methods,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Breast cancer is the most common malignant tumor among women. The diagnosis and treatment information of breast cancer patients is abundant in multiple types of clinical fields, including clinicopathological data, genotype and phenotype information, treatment information, and prognosis information. However, current studies are mainly focused on extracting information from one specific type of clinical field. This study defines a comprehensive information model to represent the whole-course clinical information of patients. Furthermore, deep learning approaches are used to extract the concepts and their attributes from clinical breast cancer documents by fine-tuning pretrained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) language models. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      The clinical corpus that was used in this study was from one 3A cancer hospital in China, consisting of the encounter notes, operation records, pathology notes, radiology notes, progress notes and discharge summaries of 100 breast cancer patients. Our system consists of two components: a named entity recognition (NER) component and a relation recognition component. For each component, we implemented deep learning-based approaches by fine-tuning BERT, which outperformed other state-of-the-art methods on multiple natural language processing (NLP) tasks. A clinical language model is first pretrained using BERT on a large-scale unlabeled corpus of Chinese clinical text. For NER, the context embeddings that were pretrained using BERT were used as the input features of the Bi-LSTM-CRF (Bidirectional long-short-memory-conditional random fields) model and were fine-tuned using the annotated breast cancer notes. Furthermore, we proposed an approach to fine-tune BERT for relation extraction. It was considered to be a classification problem in which the two entities that were mentioned in the input sentence were replaced with their semantic types. Results:
      
    

    
      Our best-performing system achieved F1 scores of 93.53% for the NER and 96.73% for the relation extraction. Additional evaluations showed that the deep learning-based approaches that fine-tuned BERT did outperform the traditional Bi-LSTM-CRF and CRF machine learning algorithms in NER and the attention-Bi-LSTM and SVM (support vector machines) algorithms in relation recognition. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      In this study, we developed a deep learning approach that fine-tuned BERT to extract the breast cancer concepts and their attributes. It demonstrated its superior performance compared to traditional machine learning algorithms, thus supporting its uses in broader NER and relation extraction tasks in the medical domain.","['1 Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College & Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', '2 Digital China Health Technologies Co.

1341,Finding phrases: On the role of co-verbal facial information in learning word order in infancy,"The input contains perceptually available cues, which might allow young infants to discover abstract properties of the target language. Thus, word frequency and prosodic prominence correlate systematically with basic word order in natural languages. Prelexical infants are sensitive to these frequency-based and prosodic cues, and use them to parse new input into phrases that follow the order characteristic of their native languages. Importantly, young infants readily integrate auditory and visual facial information while processing language. Here, we ask whether co-verbal visual information provided by talking faces also helps prelexical infants learn the word order of their native language in addition to word frequency and prosodic prominence. We created two structurally ambiguous artificial languages containing head nods produced by an animated avatar, aligned or misaligned with the frequency-based and prosodic information. During 4 minutes, two groups of 4- and 8-month-old infants were familiarized with the artificial language containing aligned auditory and visual cues, while two further groups were exposed to the misaligned language. Using a modified Headturn Preference Procedure, we tested infants' preference for test items exhibiting the word order of the native language, French, vs. the opposite word order. At 4 months, infants had no preference, suggesting that 4-month-olds were not able to integrate the three available cues, or had not yet built a representation of word order. By contrast, 8-month-olds showed no preference when auditory and visual cues were aligned and a preference for the native word order when visual cues were misaligned. These results imply that infants at this age start to integrate the co-verbal visual and auditory cues.","['1 Integrative Neuroscience and Cognition Center (INCC-UMR 8002), Université Paris Descartes (Sorbonne Paris Cité), Paris, France.', '2 Integrative Neuroscience and Cognition Center (INCC-UMR 8002), CNRS, Paris, France.', '3 Department of Psychology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', '4 Department of Linguistics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.']","Irene de la Cruz-Pavía, Judit Gervain, Eric Vatikiotis-Bateson, Janet F Werker, ",PloS one,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31710615
1342,Nonsense-Mediated mRNA Decay: Pathologies and the Potential for Novel Therapeutics,"Nonsense-mediated messenger RNA (mRNA) decay (NMD) is a surveillance pathway used by cells to control the quality mRNAs and to fine-tune transcript abundance. NMD plays an important role in cell cycle regulation, cell viability, DNA damage response, while also serving as a barrier to virus infection. Disturbance of this control mechanism caused by genetic mutations or dys-regulation of the NMD pathway can lead to pathologies, including neurological disorders, immune diseases and cancers. The role of NMD in cancer development is complex, acting as both a promoter and a barrier to tumour progression. Cancer cells can exploit NMD for the downregulation of key tumour suppressor genes, or tumours adjust NMD activity to adapt to an aggressive immune microenvironment. The latter case might provide an avenue for therapeutic intervention as NMD inhibition has been shown to lead to the production of neoantigens that stimulate an immune system attack on tumours. For this reason, understanding the biology and co-option pathways of NMD is important for the development of novel therapeutic agents. Inhibitors, whose design can make use of the many structures available for NMD study, will play a crucial role in characterizing and providing diverse therapeutic options for this pathway in cancer and other diseases.","['1 Edinburgh Cancer Research Centre, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH4 2XU, UK.', '2 International Centre for Cancer Vaccine Science, University of Gdansk, 80-308 Gdansk, Poland.']","Kamila Pawlicka, Umesh Kalathiya, Javier Alfaro, ",Cancers,2020,Cancer; NMD inhibition; Neoantigens; Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay; Premature termination codon.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32213869
1343,Differential Neurobehavioral Effects of Cross-Modal Selective Priming on Phonetic and Emotional Prosodic Information in Late Second Language Learners,"Purpose Spoken language is inherently multimodal and multidimensional in natural settings, but very little is known about how second language (L2) learners undertake multilayered speech signals with both phonetic and affective cues. This study investigated how late L2 learners undertake parallel processing of linguistic and affective information in the speech signal at behavioral and neurophysiological levels. Method Behavioral and event-related potential measures were taken in a selective cross-modal priming paradigm to examine how late L2 learners (N = 24, M age = 25.54 years) assessed the congruency of phonetic (target vowel: /a/ or /i/) and emotional (target affect: happy or angry) information between the visual primes of facial pictures and the auditory targets of spoken syllables. Results Behavioral accuracy data showed a significant congruency effect in affective (but not phonetic) priming. Unlike a previous report on monolingual first language (L1) users, the L2 users showed no facilitation in reaction time for congruency detection in either selective priming task. The neurophysiological results revealed a robust N400 response that was stronger in the phonetic condition but without clear lateralization and that the N400 effect was weaker in late L2 listeners than in monolingual L1 listeners. Following the N400, late L2 learners showed a weaker late positive response than the monolingual L1 users, particularly in the left central to posterior electrode regions. Conclusions The results demonstrate distinct patterns of behavioral and neural processing of phonetic and affective information in L2 speech with reduced neural representations in both the N400 and the later processing stage, and they provide an impetus for further research on similarities and differences in L1 and L2 multisensory speech perception in bilingualism.","['1 Department of Speech-Language-Hearing Sciences, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis.', '2 Center for Neurobehavioral Development, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis.']","Chieh Kao, Yang Zhang, ","Journal of speech, language, and hearing research : JSLHR",2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32658561
1344,A Perspective on Deep Learning for Molecular Modeling and Simulations,"Deep learning is transforming many areas in science, and it has great potential in modeling molecular systems. However, unlike the mature deployment of deep learning in computer vision and natural language processing, its development in molecular modeling and simulations is still at an early stage, largely because the inductive biases of molecules are completely different from those of images or texts. Footed on these differences, we first reviewed the limitations of traditional deep learning models from the perspective of molecular physics and wrapped up some relevant technical advancement at the interface between molecular modeling and deep learning. We do not focus merely on the ever more complex neural network models; instead, we introduce various useful concepts and ideas brought by modern deep learning. We hope that transacting these ideas into molecular modeling will create new opportunities.

1345,Epstein-Barr virus-coded miR-BART13 promotes nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell growth and metastasis via targeting of the NKIRAS2/NF-κB pathway,"Based on analysis of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) BART microRNA expression profiles, we previously reported that EBV-encoded miR-BART13 is upregulated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) plasma specimens. However, the effects and molecular mechanisms of miR-BART13 in NPC remain largely unknown. We found that miR-BART13 was significantly upregulated in NPC tissue specimens. Ectopic expression of miR-BART13 promoted NPC cell proliferation, epithelial mesenchymal transition, and metastasis in vitro, and facilitated xenograft tumor growth and lung metastasis in vivo. Molecularly, NF-κB inhibitor interacting Ras-like 2 (NKIRAS2), a negative regulator of the NF-κB signaling, was identified to be a direct target of miR-BART13 in NPC cells, and NKIRAS2 mRNA and protein expression was inversely correlated with miR-BART13 in NPC tissues, respecitvely. Furthermore, the NF-κB signaling pathway was activated by miR-BART13. By rescued experiments, reconstitution of NKIRAS2 expression abrogated all the phenotypes upregulated by miR-BART13, and attenuated activity of NF-κB signaling pathway activated by miR-BART13 in NPC cells. Our findings indicated the newly identified miR-BART13/NKIRAS2/NF-κB signaling axis may provide further insights into better understanding of NPC initiation and development, and targeting of this pathway could be further studied as a therapeutic strategy for NPC patients.","['1 Department of Radiation Oncology, Fujian Cancer Hospital, Fujian Medical University Cancer Hospital, Fuzhou, China.', '2 Laboratory of Immune Oncology, Fujian Cancer Hospital, Fujian Medical University Cancer Hospital, Fuzhou, China; Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Translational Cancer Medicine, China.', '3 State Key Laboratory for Emerging Infectious Diseases, Department of Microbiology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', '4 Department of Radiation Oncology, Fujian Cancer Hospital, Fujian Medical University Cancer Hospital, Fuzhou, China; Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Translational Cancer Medicine, China.', '5 National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China.', '6 Graduate Institute and Department of Microbiology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taiwan.', '7 Laboratory of Immune Oncology, Fujian Cancer Hospital, Fujian Medical University Cancer Hospital, Fuzhou, China; Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Translational Cancer Medicine, China.

1346,Comparison of deep learning models for natural language processing-based classification of non-English head CT reports,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      Natural language processing (NLP) can be used for automatic flagging of radiology reports. We assessed deep learning models for classifying non-English head CT reports. Methods:
      
    

    
      We retrospectively collected head CT reports (2011-2018). Reports were signed in Hebrew. Emergency department (ED) reports of adult patients from January to February for each year (2013-2018) were manually labeled. All other reports were used to pre-train an embedding layer. We explored two use cases: (1) general labeling use case, in which reports were labeled as normal vs. pathological; (2) specific labeling use case, in which reports were labeled as with and without intra-cranial hemorrhage. We tested long short-term memory (LSTM) and LSTM-attention (LSTM-ATN) networks for classifying reports. We also evaluated the improvement of adding Word2Vec word embedding. Deep learning models were compared with a bag-of-words (BOW) model. Results:
      
    

    
      We retrieved 176,988 head CT reports for pre-training. We manually labeled 7784 reports as normal (46.3%) or pathological (53.7%), and 7.1% with intra-cranial hemorrhage. For the general labeling, LSTM-ATN-Word2Vec showed the best results (AUC = 0.967 ± 0.006, accuracy 90.8% ± 0.01). For the specific labeling, all methods showed similar accuracies between 95.0 and 95.9%. Both LSTM-ATN-Word2Vec and BOW had the highest AUC (0.970). Conclusion:
      
    

    
      For a general use case, word embedding using a large cohort of non-English head CT reports and ATN improves NLP performance. For a more specific task, BOW and deep learning showed similar results. Models should be explored and tailored to the NLP task.","['1 Division of Diagnostic Imaging, Sheba Medical Center, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Derech Sheba St 2, Ramat Gan, Israel.', '2 DeepVision Lab, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat Gan, Israel.', '3 Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', '4 Management, Sheba Medical Center, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Ramat Gan, Israel.', '5 Division of Diagnostic Imaging, Sheba Medical Center, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Derech Sheba St 2, Ramat Gan, Israel. eyalkla@hotmail.com.', '6 DeepVision Lab, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat Gan, Israel. eyalkla@hotmail.com.']","Yiftach Barash, Gennadiy Guralnik, Noam Tau, Shelly Soffer, Tal Levy, Orit Shimon, Eyal Zimlichman, Eli Konen, Eyal Klang, ",Neuroradiology,2020 Oct,"Attention; Deep learning; Emergency service, hospital; Natural language processing; Tomography, X-ray computed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32335686
1347,Activation of RAW264.7 macrophages by active fraction of Albizia julibrissin saponin via Ca 2+-ERK1/2-CREB-lncRNA pathways,"The saponin active fraction from the stem bark of Albizia julibrissin (AJSAF) is an ideal vaccine adjuvant, but its mechanism of action remains unclear. The recent evidences indicate that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play essential roles in regulating the activation and function of macrophages. The current experiments were designed to investigate the effects of AJSAF on the activation of RAW264.7 macrophages and to explore its intracellular molecular mechanisms using a global gene expression microarray. AJSAF could significantly enhance phagocytic activity, induce reactive oxygen species (ROS), promote surface molecule expression, and up-regulate the mRNA and protein expression of cytokines and chemokines in RAW264.7 cells. AJSAF induced the differential expression of 223 mRNAs and 103 lncRNAs in RAW264.7 cells. Bioinformatics were used to predict the potential target mRNAs and function of up-regulated lncRNA A_30_P01018532 in RAW264.7 cells induced by AJSAF. The total 99 co-expressed mRNAs were classified as putative target genes of A_30_P01018532. A_30_P01018532 was associated with the inflammatory and immune response. AJSAF significantly increased the intracellular free Ca2+ levels and induced the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and CREB in RAW264.7 cells. Moreover, Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM, ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 and CREB inhibitor KG-501 significantly inhibited the up-regulation of TNF-α, CCL2, CXCL2, CCL22, and A_30_P01018532 in RAW264.7 cells induced by AJSAF. These results suggested that AJSAF could activate RAW264.7 cells via Ca2+-ERK1/2-CREB pathways and that A_30_P01018532 might be an important regulator of mRNA expression in AJSAF-activated macrophage. This study may provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of action of AJSAF.","['1 Key Laboratory of Animal Virology of Ministry of Agriculture, College of Animal Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310058, China.', '2 Cancer Institute and Education Ministry Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Intervention, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310009, China.', '3 Key Laboratory of Animal Virology of Ministry of Agriculture, College of Animal Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310058, China.

1348,"Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells Up-regulate PVRL1, Stabilizing PVR and Inhibiting the Cytotoxic T-Cell Response via TIGIT to Mediate Tumor Resistance to PD1 Inhibitors in Mice","Background & aims:
      
    

    
      Immune checkpoint inhibitors are effective in the treatment of some hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), but these tumors do not always respond to inhibitors of programmed cell death 1 (PDCD1, also called PD1). We investigated mechanisms of resistance of liver tumors in mice to infiltrating T cells. Methods:
      
    

    
      Mice were given hydrodynamic tail vein injections of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-Cas9 (CRISPR-Cas9) and transposon vectors to disrupt Trp53 and overexpress C-Myc (Trp53KO/C-MycOE mice). Pvrl1 and Pvrl3 were knocked down in Hepa1-6 cells by using short hairpin RNAs. Hepa1-6 cells were injected into livers of C57BL/6 mice; some mice were given intraperitoneal injections of antibodies against PD1, T-cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT), or CD8 before the cancer cells were injected. Liver tissues were collected from mice and analyzed by histology, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction; tumors were analyzed by mass cytometry using markers to detect T cells and other lymphocytes. We obtained HCC and nontumorous liver tissues and clinical data from patients who underwent surgery in Hong Kong and analyzed the tissues by immunohistochemistry. Results:
      
    

    
      Trp53KO/C-MycOE mice developed liver tumors in 3-5 weeks; injections of anti-PD1 did not slow tumor development. Tumors from mice given anti-PD1 had larger numbers of memory CD8+ T cells (CD44+CD62L-KLRG1int) and T cells that expressed PD1, lymphocyte activating 3 (LAG3), and TIGIT compared with mice not given the antibody. HCC tissues from patients had higher levels of PVRL1 messenger RNA and protein than nontumorous tissues. Increased PVRL1 was associated with shorter times of disease-free survival. Knockdown of Pvrl1 in Hepa1-6 cells caused them to form smaller tumors in mice, infiltrated by higher numbers of CD8+ T cells that expressed the inhibitory protein TIGIT; these effects were not observed in mice with depletion of CD8+ T cells. In Hepa1-6 cells, PVRL1 stabilized cell surface PVR, which interacted with TIGIT on CD8+ T cells; knockdown of Pvrl1 reduced cell-surface levels of PVR but not levels of Pvr messenger RNA. In Trp53KO/C-MycOE mice and mice with tumors grown from Hepa1-6 cells, injection of the combination of anti-PD1 and anti-TIGIT significantly reduced tumor growth, increased the ratio of cytotoxic to regulatory T cells in tumors, and prolonged survival. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      PVRL1, which is up-regulated by HCC cells, stabilizes cell surface PVR, which interacts with TIGIT, an inhibitory molecule on CD8+ effector memory T cells. This suppresses the ant-tumor immune response. Inhibitors of PVRL1/TIGIT, along with anti-PD1 might be developed for treatment of HCC.","['1 Department of Pathology, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.', '2 Department of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.', '3 ImmunoSCAPE Pte Ltd, Singapore.', '4 ImmunoSCAPE Pte Ltd, Singapore; Vaccine and Infections Disease Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', '5 Department of Pathology, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong; State Key Laboratory of Liver Research, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.', '6 Department of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong; State Key Laboratory of Liver Research, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.', '7 Department of Pathology, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong; State Key Laboratory of Liver Research, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.

1349,Extension of the Quantum Universal Exchange Language to precision medicine and drug lead discovery. Preliminary example studies using the mitochondrial genome,"The Quantum Universal Exchange Language (Q-UEL) based on Dirac notation and algebra from quantum mechanics, along with its associated data mining and Hyperbolic Dirac Net (HDN) for probabilistic inference, has proven to be a useful architectural principle for knowledge management, analysis and prediction systems in medicine. It has been described in several papers; here is described its extension to clinical genomics and precision medicine. Two use cases are studied: (a) bioinformatics in clinical decision support especially for risk for type 2 diabetes using mitochondrial patient DNA sequences, and (b) bioinformatics and computational biology (conformational) research examples related to drug discovery involving the recently discovered class of mitochondrial derived peptides (MDPs). MDPs were surprising when first discovered as coded in small open reading frames (sORFs), and are emerging as having a fundamental role in metabolic control, longevity and disease. This project originally represented a language specification study relating to what information related to genomics is essential or useful to carry, and what processing will be needed. However, novel aspects introduced or discovered include the HDN-like neural nets and their use, along with more established methods, for prediction of type 2 diabetes, and in particular for proposals for over 80 natural MDPs most of which that have not previously been described at the time of the study, as potential drug lead targets. Also, use of many medical records with simulated joining of mtDNA as performance tests led to some insightful observations regarding the behavior of HDN predictions where independent factors are involved.","['1 Ingine Inc., Delaware, USA; The Dirac Foundation, OxfordShire, UK.

1350,Can Unified Medical Language System-based semantic representation improve automated identification of patient safety incident reports by type and severity?,"Objective:
      
    

    
      The study sought to evaluate the feasibility of using Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) semantic features for automated identification of reports about patient safety incidents by type and severity. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      Binary support vector machine (SVM) classifier ensembles were trained and validated using balanced datasets of critical incident report texts (n_type = 2860, n_severity = 1160) collected from a state-wide reporting system. Generalizability was evaluated on different and independent hospital-level reporting system. Concepts were extracted from report narratives using the UMLS Metathesaurus, and their relevance and frequency were used as semantic features. Performance was evaluated by F-score, Hamming loss, and exact match score and was compared with SVM ensembles using bag-of-words (BOW) features on 3 testing datasets (type/severity: n_benchmark = 286/116, n_original = 444/4837, n_independent =6000/5950). Results:
      
    

    
      SVMs using semantic features met or outperformed those based on BOW features to identify 10 different incident types (F-score [semantics/BOW]: benchmark = 82.6%/69.4%; original = 77.9%/68.8%; independent = 78.0%/67.4%) and extreme-risk events (F-score [semantics/BOW]: benchmark = 87.3%/87.3%; original = 25.5%/19.8%; independent = 49.6%/52.7%). For incident type, the exact match score for semantic classifiers was consistently higher than BOW across all test datasets (exact match [semantics/BOW]: benchmark = 48.9%/39.9%; original = 57.9%/44.4%; independent = 59.5%/34.9%). Discussion:
      
    

    
      BOW representations are not ideal for the automated identification of incident reports because they do not account for text semantics. UMLS semantic representations are likely to better capture information in report narratives, and thus may explain their superior performance. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      UMLS-based semantic classifiers were effective in identifying incidents by type and extreme-risk events, providing better generalizability than classifiers using BOW.","['1 Centre for Health Informatics, Australian Institute of Health Innovation, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia.']","Ying Wang, Enrico Coiera, Farah Magrabi, ",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2020,UMLS; incident reporting; natural language processing; patient safety; semantics; supervised machine learning; text classification.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32574362
1351,"Extracting Clinical Features From Dictated Ambulatory Consult Notes Using a Commercially Available Natural Language Processing Tool: Pilot, Retrospective, Cross-Sectional Validation Study","Background:
      
    

    
      The increasing adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) in clinical practice holds the promise of improving care and advancing research by serving as a rich source of data, but most EHRs allow clinicians to enter data in a text format without much structure. Natural language processing (NLP) may reduce reliance on manual abstraction of these text data by extracting clinical features directly from unstructured clinical digital text data and converting them into structured data. Objective:
      
    

    
      This study aimed to assess the performance of a commercially available NLP tool for extracting clinical features from free-text consult notes. Methods:
      
    

    
      We conducted a pilot, retrospective, cross-sectional study of the accuracy of NLP from dictated consult notes from our tuberculosis clinic with manual chart abstraction as the reference standard. Consult notes for 130 patients were extracted and processed using NLP. We extracted 15 clinical features from these consult notes and grouped them a priori into categories of simple, moderate, and complex for analysis. Results:
      
    

    
      For the primary outcome of overall accuracy, NLP performed best for features classified as simple, achieving an overall accuracy of 96% (95% CI 94.3-97.6). Performance was slightly lower for features of moderate clinical and linguistic complexity at 93% (95% CI 91.1-94.4), and lowest for complex features at 91% (95% CI 87.3-93.1). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The findings of this study support the use of NLP for extracting clinical features from dictated consult notes in the setting of a tuberculosis clinic.

1352,Ontological Organization and Bioinformatic Analysis of Adverse Drug Reactions From Package Inserts: Development and Usability Study,"Background:
      
    

    
      Licensed drugs may cause unexpected adverse reactions in patients, resulting in morbidity, risk of mortality, therapy disruptions, and prolonged hospital stays. Officially approved drug package inserts list the adverse reactions identified from randomized controlled clinical trials with high evidence levels and worldwide postmarketing surveillance. Formal representation of the adverse drug reaction (ADR) enclosed in semistructured package inserts will enable deep recognition of side effects and rational drug use, substantially reduce morbidity, and decrease societal costs. Objective:
      
    

    
      This paper aims to present an ontological organization of traceable ADR information extracted from licensed package inserts. In addition, it will provide machine-understandable knowledge for bioinformatics analysis, semantic retrieval, and intelligent clinical applications. Methods:
      
    

    
      Based on the essential content of package inserts, a generic ADR ontology model is proposed from two dimensions (and nine subdimensions), covering the ADR information and medication instructions. This is followed by a customized natural language processing method programmed with Python to retrieve the relevant information enclosed in package inserts. After the biocuration and identification of retrieved data from the package insert, an ADR ontology is automatically built for further bioinformatic analysis. Results:
      
    

    
      We collected 165 package inserts of quinolone drugs from the National Medical Products Administration and other drug databases in China, and built a specialized ADR ontology containing 2879 classes and 15,711 semantic relations. For each quinolone drug, the reported ADR information and medication instructions have been logically represented and formally organized in an ADR ontology. To demonstrate its usage, the source data were further bioinformatically analyzed. For example, the number of drug-ADR triples and major ADRs associated with each active ingredient were recorded. The 10 ADRs most frequently observed among quinolones were identified and categorized based on the 18 categories defined in the proposal. The occurrence frequency, severity, and ADR mitigation method explicitly stated in package inserts were also analyzed, as well as the top 5 specific populations with contraindications for quinolone drugs. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Ontological representation and organization using officially approved information from drug package inserts enables the identification and bioinformatic analysis of adverse reactions caused by a specific drug with regard to predefined ADR ontology classes and semantic relations. The resulting ontology-based ADR knowledge source classifies drug-specific adverse reactions, and supports a better understanding of ADRs and safer prescription of medications.","['1 Institute of Medical Information, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.']","Xiaoying Li, Xin Lin, Huiling Ren, Jinjing Guo, ",Journal of medical Internet research,2020,adverse drug reactions; adverse events; bioinformatics; clinical applications; drug; information retrieval; machine-understandable knowledge; natural language processing; ontology; package inserts.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32706718
1353,Accelerated training of bootstrap aggregation-based deep information extraction systems from cancer pathology reports,"Objective:
      
    

    
      In machine learning, it is evident that the classification of the task performance increases if bootstrap aggregation (bagging) is applied. However, the bagging of deep neural networks takes tremendous amounts of computational resources and training time. The research question that we aimed to answer in this research is whether we could achieve higher task performance scores and accelerate the training by dividing a problem into sub-problems. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      The data used in this study consist of free text from electronic cancer pathology reports. We applied bagging and partitioned data training using Multi-Task Convolutional Neural Network (MT-CNN) and Multi-Task Hierarchical Convolutional Attention Network (MT-HCAN) classifiers. We split a big problem into 20 sub-problems, resampled the training cases 2,000 times, and trained the deep learning model for each bootstrap sample and each sub-problem-thus, generating up to 40,000 models. We performed the training of many models concurrently in a high-performance computing environment at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). Results:
      
    

    
      We demonstrated that aggregation of the models improves task performance compared with the single-model approach, which is consistent with other research studies; and we demonstrated that the two proposed partitioned bagging methods achieved higher classification accuracy scores on four tasks. Notably, the improvements were significant for the extraction of cancer histology data, which had more than 500 class labels in the task; these results show that data partition may alleviate the complexity of the task. On the contrary, the methods did not achieve superior scores for the tasks of site and subsite classification. Intrinsically, since data partitioning was based on the primary cancer site, the accuracy depended on the determination of the partitions, which needs further investigation and improvement. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Results in this research demonstrate that 1. The data partitioning and bagging strategy achieved higher performance scores. 2. We achieved faster training leveraged by the high-performance Summit supercomputer at ORNL.","['1 Computational Sciences and Engineering Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN 37830, United States of America.

1354,Predicting human odor perception represented by continuous values from mass spectra of essential oils resembling chemical mixtures,"There have been recent advances in predicting odor characteristics using molecular structure parameters of chemicals. Although the molecular structure parameters are available for each chemical, they cannot be used for chemical mixtures. This study will elucidate a computational method of predicting human odor perception from the mass spectra of chemical mixtures such as essential oils. Furthermore, a method for obtaining similarity among odor descriptors has been proposed although the dataset contains binary values only. When the database indicates a set of odor descriptors for one sample, only binary data are available and the correlation between the similar descriptors disappears. Thus, the prediction performance degrades for not considering the similarity among the odor descriptors. Since mass spectra dataset is highly dimensional, we use auto-encoder to learn the compressed representation from the mass spectra of essential oils in its bottleneck hidden layer and then accomplishes the hierarchical clustering to create odor descriptor groups with similar odor impressions using a matrix of continuous value-based correlation coefficient as well as natural language processing. This work will help to expatiate the process of overcoming binary value problem and find out the similarity among odor descriptors using machine learning with natural language semantic representation of words. To overcome the problem of disproportionate ratio of positive and negative class for both the continuous value-based correlation coefficient and word similarity based models, we use Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). This model allows us to predict human odor perception through computer simulations by forming odor descriptors group.

The master regulator of NMD is UPF1, an enzyme with intrinsic ATPase and helicase activities. The cancer genomic sequencing data has identified frequently mutated residues in the CH-domain and ATP-binding site of UPF1. In silico screening of UPF1 stability change as a function over 41 cancer mutations has identified five variants with significant effects: K164R, R253W, T499M, E637K, and E833K. To explore the effects of these mutations on the associated energy landscape of UPF1, molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) were performed. MDS identified stable H-bonds between residues S152, S203, S205, Q230/R703, and UPF2/AMPPNP, and suggest that phosphorylation of Serine residues may control UPF1-UPF2 binding. Moreover, the alleles K164R and R253W in the CH-domain improved UPF1-UPF2 binding. In addition, E637K and E833K alleles exhibited improved UPF1-AMPPNP binding compared to the T499M variant; the lower binding is predicted from hindrance caused by the side-chain of T499M to the docking of the tri-phosphate moiety (AMPPNP) into the substrate site. The dynamics of wild-type/mutant systems highlights the flexible nature of the ATP-binding region in UPF1. These insights can facilitate the development of drug discovery strategies for manipulating NMD signaling in cell systems using chemical tools.","['1 University of Gdansk, International Centre for Cancer Vaccine Science, Wita Stwosza 63, 80-308 Gdansk, Poland.', '2 University of Edinburgh, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, Edinburgh, Scotland EH4 2XR, UK.', '3 Bioinformatics Institute, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), 30 Biopolis Street, 07-01 Matrix, Singapore 138671, Singapore.', '4 Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore, 16 Science Drive 4, Singapore 117558, Singapore.', '5 School of Biological Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, 60 Nanyang Drive, Singapore 637551, Singapore.', '6 University of Edinburgh, Institute of Quantitative Biology, Biochemistry and Biotechnology, Edinburgh, Scotland EH9 3BF, UK.']","Umesh Kalathiya, Monikaben Padariya, Kamila Pawlicka, Chandra S Verma, Douglas Houston, Ted R Hupp, Javier Antonio Alfaro, ",International journal of molecular sciences,2019,ATP-binding site; UPF1; UPF2; cancer mutations; molecular dynamics simulations; structural stability.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31718065

The methodology used involved analyzing large volumes of text data mined from 3186 patents related to these three fields. Latent Dirichlet Allocation and the perplexity method were used to identify the main topics which the patent corpora were comprised of and which technological concepts were most associated with each topic. In addition, term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) was used to gauge the ""emergingness"" of certain technical concepts across the patent corpora in various years. The key results were as follows: (1) perplexity computations showed that a 20 topic models were feasible for these patent corpora; (2) topics were identified, providing an accurate picture of the patenting landscape in the analyzed fields; (3) TF-IDF analysis on unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams, supplemented with network graph analysis, revealed emerging technology trends in each year. This study has important implications for governments who need to decide where to invest resources in anaerobic food waste treatment.","['1 State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China.', '2 State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China.

1357,Musical Training for Auditory Rehabilitation in Hearing Loss,"Despite the overall success of cochlear implantation, language outcomes remain suboptimal and subject to large inter-individual variability. Early auditory rehabilitation techniques have mostly focused on low-level sensory abilities. However, a new body of literature suggests that cognitive operations are critical for auditory perception remediation. We argue in this paper that musical training is a particularly appealing candidate for such therapies, as it involves highly relevant cognitive abilities, such as temporal predictions, hierarchical processing, and auditory-motor interactions. We review recent studies demonstrating that music can enhance both language perception and production at multiple levels, from syllable processing to turn-taking in natural conversation.","['1 Institut de Neurosciences des Systèmes, Aix Marseille University, Inserm, INS, 13005 Marseille, France.']","Jacques Pesnot Lerousseau, Céline Hidalgo, Daniele Schön, ",Journal of clinical medicine,2020,cochlear implants; hearing loss; musical training; speech development.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32276390
1358,Projection Word Embedding Model With Hybrid Sampling Training for Classifying ICD-10-CM Codes: Longitudinal Observational Study,"Background:
      
    

    
      Most current state-of-the-art models for searching the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes use word embedding technology to capture useful semantic properties. However, they are limited by the quality of initial word embeddings. Word embedding trained by electronic health records (EHRs) is considered the best, but the vocabulary diversity is limited by previous medical records. Thus, we require a word embedding model that maintains the vocabulary diversity of open internet databases and the medical terminology understanding of EHRs. Moreover, we need to consider the particularity of the disease classification, wherein discharge notes present only positive disease descriptions. Objective:
      
    

    
      We aimed to propose a projection word2vec model and a hybrid sampling method. In addition, we aimed to conduct a series of experiments to validate the effectiveness of these methods. Methods:
      
    

    
      We compared the projection word2vec model and traditional word2vec model using two corpora sources: English Wikipedia and PubMed journal abstracts. We used seven published datasets to measure the medical semantic understanding of the word2vec models and used these embeddings to identify the three-character-level ICD-10-CM diagnostic codes in a set of discharge notes. On the basis of embedding technology improvement, we also tried to apply the hybrid sampling method to improve accuracy. The 94,483 labeled discharge notes from the Tri-Service General Hospital of Taipei, Taiwan, from June 1, 2015, to June 30, 2017, were used. To evaluate the model performance, 24,762 discharge notes from July 1, 2017, to December 31, 2017, from the same hospital were used. Moreover, 74,324 additional discharge notes collected from seven other hospitals were tested. The F-measure, which is the major global measure of effectiveness, was adopted. Results:
      
    

    
      In medical semantic understanding, the original EHR embeddings and PubMed embeddings exhibited superior performance to the original Wikipedia embeddings. After projection training technology was applied, the projection Wikipedia embeddings exhibited an obvious improvement but did not reach the level of original EHR embeddings or PubMed embeddings. In the subsequent ICD-10-CM coding experiment, the model that used both projection PubMed and Wikipedia embeddings had the highest testing mean F-measure (0.7362 and 0.6693 in Tri-Service General Hospital and the seven other hospitals, respectively). Moreover, the hybrid sampling method was found to improve the model performance (F-measure=0.7371/0.6698). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The word embeddings trained using EHR and PubMed could understand medical semantics better, and the proposed projection word2vec model improved the ability of medical semantics extraction in Wikipedia embeddings. Although the improvement from the projection word2vec model in the real ICD-10-CM coding task was not substantial, the models could effectively handle emerging diseases. The proposed hybrid sampling method enables the model to behave like a human expert.","['1 Graduate Institute of Life Sciences, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan.', '2 School of Public Health, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan.', '3 Planning and Management Office, Tri-Service General Hospital, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan.', '4 Department of Medical Record, Tri-Service General Hospital, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan.', '5 Department of Family and Community Medicine, Tri-Service General Hospital, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan.']","Chin Lin, Yu-Sheng Lou, Dung-Jang Tsai, Chia-Cheng Lee, Chia-Jung Hsu, Ding-Chung Wu, Mei-Chuen Wang, Wen-Hui Fang, ",JMIR medical informatics,2019,artificial intelligence; convolutional neural network; electronic health records; natural language processing; word embedding.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31339103
1359,Poor neural and perceptual phoneme discrimination during acoustic variation in dyslexia,"Whereas natural acoustic variation in speech does not compromise phoneme discrimination in healthy adults, it was hypothesized to be a challenge for developmental dyslexics. We investigated dyslexics' neural and perceptual discrimination of native language phonemes during acoustic variation. Dyslexics and non-dyslexics heard /æ/ and /i/ phonemes in a context with fo variation and then in a context without it. Mismatch negativity (MMN) and P3a responses to phoneme changes were recorded with electroencephalogram to compare groups during ignore and attentive listening. Perceptual phoneme discrimination in the variable context was evaluated with hit-ratios and reaction times. MMN/N2bs were diminished in dyslexics in the variable context. Hit-ratios were smaller in dyslexics than controls. MMNs did not differ between groups in the context without variation. These results suggest that even distinctive vowels are challenging to discriminate for dyslexics when the context resembles natural variability of speech. This most likely reflects poor categorical perception of phonemes in dyslexics. Difficulties to detect linguistically relevant invariant information during acoustic variation in speech may contribute to dyslexics' deficits in forming native language phoneme representations during infancy. Future studies should acknowledge that simple experimental paradigms with repetitive stimuli can be insensitive to dyslexics' speech processing deficits.","['1 Cognitive Brain Research Unit, Department of Psychology and Logopedics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland. paula.virtala@helsinki.fi.', '2 Cognitive Brain Research Unit, Institute for Behavioural Sciences, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland. paula.virtala@helsinki.fi.', '3 Cognitive Brain Research Unit, Department of Psychology and Logopedics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', '4 Cognitive Brain Research Unit, Institute for Behavioural Sciences, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', '5 Center of Functionally Integrative Neuroscience (CFIN), Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.']","P Virtala, S Talola, E Partanen, T Kujala, ",Scientific reports,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32457322

      Surgical site infections are a major driver of morbidity and increased costs in the postoperative period after spine surgery. Current tools for surveillance of these adverse events rely on prospective clinical tracking, manual retrospective chart review, or administrative procedural and diagnosis codes. Purpose:
      
    

    
      The purpose of this study was to develop natural language processing (NLP) algorithms for automated reporting of postoperative wound infection requiring reoperation after lumbar discectomy. Patient sample:
      
    

    
      Adult patients undergoing discectomy at two academic and three community medical centers between January 1, 2000 and July 31, 2019 for lumbar disc herniation. Outcome measures:
      
    

    
      Reoperation for wound infection within 90 days after surgery METHODS: Free-text notes of patients who underwent surgery from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2015 were used for algorithm training. Free-text notes of patients who underwent surgery after January 1, 2016 were used for algorithm testing. Manual chart review was used to label which patients had reoperation for wound infection. An extreme gradient-boosting NLP algorithm was developed to detect reoperation for postoperative wound infection. Results:
      
    

    
      Overall, 5,860 patients were included in this study and 62 (1.1%) had a reoperation for wound infection. In patients who underwent surgery after January 1, 2016 (n=1,377), the NLP algorithm detected 15 of the 16 patients (sensitivity=0.94) who had reoperation for infection. In comparison, current procedural terminology and international classification of disease codes detected 12 of these 16 patients (sensitivity=0.75). At a threshold of 0.05, the NLP algorithm had positive predictive value of 0.83 and F1-score of 0.88. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Temporal validation of the algorithm developed in this study demonstrates a proof-of-concept application of NLP for automated reporting of adverse events after spine surgery. Adapting this methodology for other procedures and outcomes in spine and orthopedics has the potential to dramatically improve and automatize quality and safety reporting.","['1 Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', '2 Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Newton Wellesley Hospital, Newton, MA, USA.', '3 Department of Neurosurgery, North Shore Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA.', ""4 Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Brigham and Women's Faulkner Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", '5 Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Newton Wellesley Hospital, Newton, MA, USA.

The proposed deep network has four convolutional layers, three max-pooling layers, and two parallel fully connected layers. To adjust the deep network to multitask learning problem, we propose to learn a low-rank deep network so that the relation among different tasks can be explored. We proposed to minimize the number of independent parameter rows of one fully connected layer to explore the relations among different tasks, which is measured by the nuclear norm of the parameter of one fully connected layer, and seek a low-rank parameter matrix. Meanwhile, we also propose to regularize another fully connected layer by sparsity penalty so that the useful features learned by the lower layers can be selected. The learning problem is solved by an iterative algorithm based on gradient descent and back-propagation algorithms. The proposed algorithm is evaluated over benchmark datasets of multiple face attribute prediction, multitask natural language processing, and joint economics index predictions. The evaluation results show the advantage of the low-rank deep CNN model over multitask problems.","[""1 Shaanxi University of Science & Technology, Xi'an, Shaanxi Province 710021, China."", ""2 Northwest University of Political Science and Law, Xi'an, Shaanxi Province 710063, China."", '3 New York University Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi, UAE.']","Fang Su, Hai-Yang Shang, Jing-Yan Wang, ",Computational intelligence and neuroscience,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31236107
1363,"Enhancing Case Capture, Quality, and Completeness of Primary Melanoma Pathology Records via Natural Language Processing","Purpose:
      
    

    
      Medical records contain a wealth of useful, informative data points valuable for clinical research. Most data points are stored in semistructured or unstructured legacy documents and require manual data abstraction into a structured format to render the information more readily accessible, searchable, and generally analysis ready. The substantial labor needed for this can be cost prohibitive, particularly when dealing with large patient cohorts. Methods:
      
    

    
      To establish a high-throughput approach to data abstraction, we developed a novel framework using natural language processing (NLP) and a decision-rules algorithm to extract, transform, and load (ETL) melanoma primary pathology features from pathology reports in an institutional legacy electronic medical record system into a structured database. We compared a subset of these data with a manually curated data set comprising the same patients and developed a novel scoring system to assess confidence in records generated by the algorithm, thus obviating manual review of high-confidence records while flagging specific, low-confidence records for review. Results:
      
    

    
      The algorithm generated 368,624 individual melanoma data points comprising 16 primary tumor prognostic factors and metadata from 23,039 patients. From these data points, a subset of 147,872 was compared with an existing, manually abstracted data set, demonstrating an exact or synonymous match between 90.4% of all data points. Additionally, the confidence-scoring algorithm demonstrated an error rate of only 3.7%. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Our NLP platform can identify and abstract melanoma primary prognostic factors with accuracy comparable to that of manual abstraction (< 5% error rate), with vastly greater efficiency. Principles used in the development of this algorithm could be expanded to include other melanoma-specific data points as well as disease-agnostic fields and further enhance capture of essential elements from nonstructured data.","['1 The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.']","Jared C Malke, Shida Jin, Samuel P Camp, Bryan Lari, Trey Kell, Julie M Simon, Victor G Prieto, Jeffrey E Gershenwald, Lauren E Haydu, ",JCO clinical cancer informatics,2019 Aug,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31442076

      To develop and test a method for automatic assessment of a quality metric, provider-documented pretreatment digital rectal examination (DRE), using the outputs of a natural language processing (NLP) framework. Setting:
      
    

    
      An electronic health records (EHR)-based prostate cancer data warehouse was used to identify patients and associated clinical notes from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2017. Using a previously developed natural language processing pipeline, we classified DRE assessment as documented (currently or historically performed), deferred (or suggested as a future examination) and refused.

1365,Identification and characterization of tweets related to the 2015 Indiana HIV outbreak: A retrospective infoveillance study,"Introduction:
      
    

    
      From late 2014 through 2015, Scott County, Indiana faced an HIV outbreak triggered by opioid abuse and transition to injection drug use. Investigating the origins, risk factors, and responses related to this outbreak is critical to inform future surveillance, interventions, and policymaking. In response, this retrospective infoveillance study identifies and characterizes user-generated messages related to opioid abuse, heroin injection drug use, and HIV status using natural language processing (NLP) among Twitter users in Indiana during the period of this HIV outbreak. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      Our study consisted of two phases: data collection and processing, and data analysis. We collected Indiana geolocated tweets from the public Twitter API using Amazon Web Services EC2 instances filtered for geocoded messages in the immediate pre and post period of the outbreak. In the data analysis phase we applied an unsupervised machine learning approach using NLP called the Biterm Topic Model (BTM) to identify tweets related to opioid, heroin/injection, and HIV behavior and then examined these messages for HIV risk-related topics that could be associated with the outbreak. Results:
      
    

    
      More than 10 million geocoded tweets occurring in Indiana during the immediate pre and post period of the outbreak were collected for analysis. Using BTM, we identified 1350 tweets thought to be relevant to the outbreak and then confirmed 358 tweets using human annotation. The most prevalent themes identified were tweets related to self-reported abuse of illicit and prescription drugs, opioid use disorder, self-reported HIV status, and public sentiment regarding the outbreak. Geospatial analysis found that these messages clustered in population dense areas outside of the outbreak, including Indianapolis and neighboring Clark County. Discussion:
      
    

    
      This infoveillance study characterized the social media conversations of communities in Indiana in the pre and post period of the 2015 HIV outbreak. Behavioral themes detected reflect discussion about risk factors related to HIV transmission stemming from opioid and heroin abuse for priority populations, and also help identify community attitudes that could have motivated or detracted the use of HIV prevention methods, along with helping identify factors that can impede access to prevention services. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Infoveillance approaches, such as the analysis conducted in this study, represent a possibly strategy to detect ""signal"" of the emergence of risk factors associated with an outbreak though may be limited in their scope and generalizability. Our results, in conjunction with other forms of public health surveillance, can leverage the growing ubiquity of social media platforms to better detect opioid-related HIV risk knowledge, attitudes and behavior, as well as inform future prevention efforts.","['1 Global Health Policy Institute, San Diego, CA, United States of America.', '2 Department of Healthcare Research and Policy, University of California, San Diego, CA, United States of America.', '3 Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego, CA, United States of America.', '4 Department of Computational Science, Mathematics and Engineering, University of California, San Diego, CA, United States of America.', '5 Department of Anesthesiology, San Diego School of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, CA, United States of America.', '6 Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin, Germany.', '7 Division of Infections Disease and Global Public Health, Department of Medicine, San Diego School of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, CA, United States of America.']","Mingxiang Cai, Neal Shah, Jiawei Li, Wen-Hao Chen, Raphael E Cuomo, Nick Obradovich, Tim K Mackey, ",PloS one,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32845882

The extraction of the details necessary to reproduce and validate a synthesis in a chemical laboratory is often a tedious task requiring extensive human intervention. We present a method to convert unstructured experimental procedures written in English to structured synthetic steps (action sequences) reflecting all the operations needed to successfully conduct the corresponding chemical reactions. To achieve this, we design a set of synthesis actions with predefined properties and a deep-learning sequence to sequence model based on the transformer architecture to convert experimental procedures to action sequences. The model is pretrained on vast amounts of data generated automatically with a custom rule-based natural language processing approach and refined on manually annotated samples. Predictions on our test set result in a perfect (100%) match of the action sequence for 60.8% of sentences, a 90% match for 71.3% of sentences, and a 75% match for 82.4% of sentences.","['1 IBM Research Europe, Säumerstrasse 4, Rüschlikon, 8803, Switzerland. ava@zurich.ibm.com.', '2 IBM Research Europe, Säumerstrasse 4, Rüschlikon, 8803, Switzerland.']","Alain C Vaucher, Federico Zipoli, Joppe Geluykens, Vishnu H Nair, Philippe Schwaller, Teodoro Laino, ",Nature communications,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32681088

      The BPJS Kesehatan dataset have been preprocessed using a nested case-control design into preeclampsia/eclampsia (n = 3318) and normotensive pregnant women (n = 19,883) from all women with one pregnancy. The dataset provided 95 features consisting of demographic variables and medical histories started from 24 months to event and ended by delivery as the event. Six algorithms were compared by area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) with a subgroup analysis by time to the event. We compared our model to similar prediction models from systematically reviewed studies. In addition, we conducted a text mining analysis based on natural language processing techniques to interpret our modeling results. Findings:
      
    

    
      The best model consisted of 17 predictors extracted by a random forest algorithm. Nine∼12 months to the event was the period that had the best AUROC in external validation by either geographical (0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88-0.89) or temporal split (0.86, 95% CI 0.85-0.86). We compared this model to prediction models in seven studies from 869 records in PUBMED, EMBASE, and SCOPUS. This model outperformed the previous models in terms of the precision, sensitivity, and specificity in all validation sets. Interpretation:

Nowadays, DL provides an unprecedented way to analyze and process data with demonstrated great results in computer vision, medical imaging, natural language processing, and so forth. Herein, applications of DL in NMR spectroscopy are summarized, and a perspective for DL as an entirely new approach that is likely to transform NMR spectroscopy into a much more efficient and powerful technique in chemistry and life sciences is outlined.","['1 Department of Electronic Science, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Plasma and Magnetic Resonance, Xiamen University, P.O.

1369,(Early) context effects on event-related potentials over natural inputs,"Language understanding requires the integration of the input with preceding context. Event-related potentials (ERPs) have contributed significantly to our understanding of what contextual information is accessed and when. Much of this research has, however, been limited to experimenter-designed stimuli with highly atypical lexical and context statistics. This raises questions about the extent to which previous findings generalize to everyday language processing of natural stimuli with typical linguistic statistics. We ask whether context can affect ERPs over natural stimuli early, before the N400 time window. We re-analyzed a data set of ERPs over ~700 visually presented content words in sentences from English novels. To increase power, we employed linear mixed effects regression simultaneously modeling random variance by subject and by item. To reduce concerns about Type I error inflation common to any type of time series analysis, we introduced a simple approach to model and discount auto-correlations at multiple, empirically determined, time lags. We compared this approach to Bonferroni correction. Planned follow-up analyses used Generalized Additive Mixture Models to assess the linearity of contextual effects, including lexical surprisal, found within the N400 time window. We found that contextual information affects ERPs in both early (~200ms after word onset) and late (N400) time windows, supporting a cascading, interactive account of lexical access.","['1 Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, University of Rochester.', '2 Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Department of Computer Science, University of Rochester.']","Shaorong Yan, T Florian Jaeger, ","Language, cognition and neuroscience",2020,auto-correlation; event-related potentials; generalized additive mixture models; mixed-effects regression; time course analysis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32617349
1370,Hybrid bag of approaches to characterize selection criteria for cohort identification,"Objective:
      
    

    
      The 2018 National NLP Clinical Challenge (2018 n2c2) focused on the task of cohort selection for clinical trials, where participating systems were tasked with analyzing longitudinal patient records to determine if the patients met or did not meet any of the 13 selection criteria. This article describes our participation in this shared task. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      We followed a hybrid approach combining pattern-based, knowledge-intensive, and feature weighting techniques. After preprocessing the notes using publicly available natural language processing tools, we developed individual criterion-specific components that relied on collecting knowledge resources relevant for these criteria and pattern-based and weighting approaches to identify ""met"" and ""not met"" cases. Results:
      
    

    
      As part of the 2018 n2c2 challenge, 3 runs were submitted. The overall micro-averaged F1 on the training set was 0.9444. On the test set, the micro-averaged F1 for the 3 submitted runs were 0.9075, 0.9065, and 0.9056. The best run was placed second in the overall challenge and all 3 runs were statistically similar to the top-ranked system. A reimplemented system achieved the best overall F1 of 0.9111 on the test set. Discussion:
      
    

    
      We highlight the need for a focused resource-intensive effort to address the class imbalance in the cohort selection identification task. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Our hybrid approach was able to identify all selection criteria with high F1 performance on both training and test sets. Based on our participation in the 2018 n2c2 task, we conclude that there is merit in continuing a focused criterion-specific analysis and developing appropriate knowledge resources to build a quality cohort selection system.","['1 Department of Learning Health Sciences, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', '2 School of Information, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', '3 Department of Mathematics and Statistics, College of Arts, Sciences, and Letters, University of Michigan-Dearborn, Dearborn, Michigan, USA.']","V G Vinod Vydiswaran, Asher Strayhorn, Xinyan Zhao, Phil Robinson, Mahesh Agarwal, Erin Bagazinski, Madia Essiet, Bradley E Iott, Hyeon Joo, PingJui Ko, Dahee Lee, Jin Xiu Lu, Jinghui Liu, Adharsh Murali, Koki Sasagawa, Tianshi Wang, Nalingna Yuan, ",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2019,clinical trial selection criteria; cohort identification; information storage and retrieval [L01.313.500.750.280]; information systems [L01.313.500.750.300]; natural language processing (L01.224.065.580).,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31197354
1371,Predicting toxicity of chemicals: software beats animal testing,"We created earlier a large machine-readable database of 10,000 chemicals and 800,000 associated studies by natural language processing of the public parts of Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) registrations until December 2014. This database was used to assess the reproducibility of the six most frequently used Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guideline tests. These tests consume 55% of all animals in safety testing in Europe, i.e. about 600,000 animals. With 350-750 chemicals with multiple results per test, reproducibility (balanced accuracy) was 81% and 69% of toxic substances were found again in a repeat experiment (sensitivity 69%). Inspired by the increasingly used read-across approach, we created a new type of QSAR, which is based on similarity of chemicals and not on chemical descriptors. A landscape of the chemical universe using 10 million structures was calculated, when based on Tanimoto indices similar chemicals are close and dissimilar chemicals far from each other. This allows placing any chemical of interest into the map and evaluating the information available for surrounding chemicals. In a data fusion approach, in which 74 different properties were taken into consideration, machine learning (random forest) allowed a fivefold cross-validation for 190,000 (non-) hazard labels of chemicals for which nine hazards were predicted. The balanced accuracy of this approach was 87% with a sensitivity of 89%. Each prediction comes with a certainty measure based on the homogeneity of data and distance of neighbours. Ongoing developments and future opportunities are discussed.","['1 Johns Hopkins University Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing (CAAT) Baltimore MD USA.', '2 University of Konstanz CAAT-Europe Konstanz Germany.']","Thomas Hartung, ",EFSA journal.

1373,Association between DSM-5 and ICD-11 personality dimensional traits in a general medical cohort and readmission and mortality,"Background:
      
    

    
      Personality has long been studied as a factor associated with health outcomes. Investigations of large, generalizable clinical cohorts are limited by variations in personality diagnostic methodologies and difficulties with long-term follow-up. Methods:
      
    

    
      Electronic health records of a cohort of patients admitted to a general hospital were characterized using a previously developed natural language processing tool for extracting DSM-5 and ICD-11 personality domains. We used Cox regression and Fine-Gray competing risk survival to analyze the relationships between these personality estimates, sociodemographic features, and risk of readmission and mortality. Results:
      
    

    
      Among 12,274 patients, 2379 deaths occurred in the course of 61,761 patient-years at risk, with 19,985 admissions during follow-up. Detachment was the most common personality feature. Presence of disinhibition was independently associated with a higher mortality risk, while anankastic traits were associated with a lower mortality risk. Increased likelihood of readmission was predicted by detachment, while decreased likelihood of readmission was associated with disinhibition and psychoticism traits. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Personality features can be identified from electronic health records and are associated with readmission and mortality risk. Developing treatment strategies that target patients with higher personality symptom burden in specific dimensions could enable more efficient and focused interventions.","['1 Center for Quantitative Health, Division of Clinical Research and Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA; Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, Harvard University, Boston, MA, USA; University Psychiatric Clinic, University of Chile Clinical Hospital, Santiago, Chile.', '2 Center for Quantitative Health, Division of Clinical Research and Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.', '3 Center for Quantitative Health, Division of Clinical Research and Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA; Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, Harvard University, Boston, MA, USA.', '4 Center for Quantitative Health, Division of Clinical Research and Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA; Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, Harvard University, Boston, MA, USA.

1375,Technology opportunity discovery by structuring user needs based on natural language processing and machine learning,"Discovering technology opportunities from the opinion of users can promote successful technological development by satisfying the needs of users. However, although previous approaches using opinion mining only have classified various needs of users into positive or negative categories, they cannot derive the main reasons for their opinion. To solve this problem, this research proposes an approach to exploring technology opportunity by structuring user needs with a concept of opinion trigger of objects and functions of the technology-based products. To discover technology opportunity, first, an opinion trigger is identified from review data using Naïve Base classifier and natural language processing. Second, the opinion triggers and patent keywords that have a similar meaning in context are clustered to discover the needs of the user and need-related technology. Then, the sentimental values of needs are calculated through graph-based semi-supervised learning. Finally, the needs of the user are classified in resolving the problem of vacant technology to discover technology opportunity. Then, an R&D strategy of each opportunity is suggested based on opinion triggers, patent keywords, and their property. Based on the concept of opinion trigger-based methodology, a case study is conducted on automobile-related reviews, extracting the customer needs and presenting important R&D projects such as an extracted need (cargo transportation) and its R&D strategy (resolving contradiction). The proposed approach can analyze the needs of user at a functional level to discover new technology opportunities.","['1 Department of Industrial & Systems Engineering, School of Engineering, Dongguk University, Seoul, South Korea.']","Taeyeoun Roh, Yujin Jeong, Hyejin Jang, Byungun Yoon, ",PloS one,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31661516
1376,Cross-lingual Unified Medical Language System entity linking in online health communities,"Objective:
      
    

    
      In Hebrew online health communities, participants commonly write medical terms that appear as transliterated forms of a source term in English. Such transliterations introduce high variability in text and challenge text-analytics methods. To reduce their variability, medical terms must be normalized, such as linking them to Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) concepts. We present a method to identify both transliterated and translated Hebrew medical terms and link them with UMLS entities. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      We investigate the effect of linking terms in Camoni, a popular Israeli online health community in Hebrew. Our method, MDTEL (Medical Deep Transliteration Entity Linking), includes (1) an attention-based recurrent neural network encoder-decoder to transliterate words and mapping UMLS from English to Hebrew, (2) an unsupervised method for creating a transliteration dataset in any language without manually labeled data, and (3) an efficient way to identify and link medical entities in the Hebrew corpus to UMLS concepts, by producing a high-recall list of candidate medical terms in the corpus, and then filtering the candidates to relevant medical terms. Results:
      
    

    
      We carry out experiments on 3 disease-specific communities: diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and depression. MDTEL tagging and normalizing on Camoni posts achieved 99% accuracy, 92% recall, and 87% precision. When tagging and normalizing terms in queries from the Camoni search logs, UMLS-normalized queries improved search results in 46% of the cases. Conclusions:

1377,Toward a clinical text encoder: pretraining for clinical natural language processing with applications to substance misuse,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Our objective is to develop algorithms for encoding clinical text into representations that can be used for a variety of phenotyping tasks. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      Obtaining large datasets to take advantage of highly expressive deep learning methods is difficult in clinical natural language processing (NLP). We address this difficulty by pretraining a clinical text encoder on billing code data, which is typically available in abundance. We explore several neural encoder architectures and deploy the text representations obtained from these encoders in the context of clinical text classification tasks. While our ultimate goal is learning a universal clinical text encoder, we also experiment with training a phenotype-specific encoder. A universal encoder would be more practical, but a phenotype-specific encoder could perform better for a specific task. Results:
      
    

    
      We successfully train several clinical text encoders, establish a new state-of-the-art on comorbidity data, and observe good performance gains on substance misuse data. Discussion:
      
    

    
      We find that pretraining using billing codes is a promising research direction. The representations generated by this type of pretraining have universal properties, as they are highly beneficial for many phenotyping tasks. Phenotype-specific pretraining is a viable route for trading the generality of the pretrained encoder for better performance on a specific phenotyping task. Conclusions:

1378,Electronic Medical Record Search Engine (EMERSE): An Information Retrieval Tool for Supporting Cancer Research,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      The Electronic Medical Record Search Engine (EMERSE) is a software tool built to aid research spanning cohort discovery, population health, and data abstraction for clinical trials. EMERSE is now live at three academic medical centers, with additional sites currently working on implementation. In this report, we describe how EMERSE has been used to support cancer research based on a variety of metrics. Methods:
      
    

    
      We identified peer-reviewed publications that used EMERSE through online searches as well as through direct e-mails to users based on audit logs. These logs were also used to summarize use at each of the three sites. Search terms for two of the sites were characterized using the natural language processing tool MetaMap to determine to which semantic types the terms could be mapped. Results:
      
    

    
      We identified a total of 326 peer-reviewed publications that used EMERSE through August 2019, although this is likely an underestimation of the true total based on the use log analysis. Oncology-related research comprised nearly one third (n = 105; 32.2%) of all research output. The use logs showed that EMERSE had been used by multiple people at each site (nearly 3,500 across all three) who had collectively logged into the system > 100,000 times. Many user-entered search queries could not be mapped to a semantic type, but the most common semantic type for terms that did match was ""disease or syndrome,"" followed by ""pharmacologic substance.""

1379,Electrophysiology reflects the influence of discourse context on auditory semantic processing in bilinguals,"Most language experiences take place at the level of multiple sentences. However, previous studies of second language (L2) comprehension have typically focused on lexical- and sentence-level processing. Our study addresses this gap by examining auditory discourse comprehension in 32 English/French bilinguals. We tested the prediction of the noisy channel model (Futrell & Gibson, 2017) that bilinguals will rely more on top-down, discourse-level cues in L2 because these are common across languages, as opposed to the language-specific associations of an often weaker L2. We further hypothesized that these effects could be influenced by individual differences, such that participants with lower L2 proficiency or working memory would have more difficulty building and maintaining discourse context. Specifically, we measured the N400 response, an index of automatic semantic processing. Participants heard three-sentence stories with prime and target words in the final sentence whose lexical association was manipulated, as was the congruence of the target with the preceding discourse. Overall, our results support the noisy channel model of language comprehension in a sample of highly proficient bilinguals. We observed larger N400 effects of discourse congruence than lexical association, and the difference between these 2 conditions was greater in the L2 than in the L1. Additionally, the effects of lexical association were limited to the L1 and predicted by individual differences in language dominance but not working memory. These findings suggest that bilinguals do indeed make greater use of top-down, supralinguistic information in their L2 compared with their L1.

      The population-based assessment of patient-centered outcomes (PCOs) has been limited by the efficient and accurate collection of these data. Natural language processing (NLP) pipelines can determine whether a clinical note within an electronic medical record contains evidence on these data. We present and demonstrate the accuracy of an NLP pipeline that targets to assess the presence, absence, or risk discussion of two important PCOs following prostate cancer treatment: urinary incontinence (UI) and bowel dysfunction (BD). Methods:
      
    

    
      We propose a weakly supervised NLP approach which annotates electronic medical record clinical notes without requiring manual chart review. A weighted function of neural word embedding was used to create a sentence-level vector representation of relevant expressions extracted from the clinical notes. Sentence vectors were used as input for a multinomial logistic model, with output being either presence, absence or risk discussion of UI/BD. The classifier was trained based on automated sentence annotation depending only on domain-specific dictionaries (weak supervision). Results:
      
    

    
      The model achieved an average F1 score of 0.86 for the sentence-level, three-tier classification task (presence/absence/risk) in both UI and BD. The model also outperformed a pre-existing rule-based model for note-level annotation of UI with significant margin. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We demonstrate a machine learning method to categorize clinical notes based on important PCOs that trains a classifier on sentence vector representations labeled with a domain-specific dictionary, which eliminates the need for manual engineering of linguistic rules or manual chart review for extracting the PCOs. The weakly supervised NLP pipeline showed promising sensitivity and specificity for identifying important PCOs in unstructured clinical text notes compared to rule-based algorithms.","['1 Department of Biomedical Data Science, Stanford University School of Medicine, Medical School Office Building (MSOB), 1265 Welch Road, Stanford, California 94305-5479, USA.', '2 Stanford University School of Medicine, 291 Campus Drive, Stanford, California 94305-5479, USA.', '3 Department of Biomedical Informatics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Medical School Office Building (MSOB), 1265 Welch Road, Stanford, California 94305-5479, USA.', '4 Department of Urology - Divisions, Stanford University School of Medicine, 875 Blake Wilbur, Stanford, California 94305-5479, USA.', '5 IRT Research Technology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California 94305-5479, USA.', '6 Department of Radiology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California 94305-5479, USA.', '7 Department of Medicine (Biomedical Informatics), Stanford University School of Medicine, Medical School Office Building (MSOB), 1265 Welch Road, Stanford, California 94305-5479, USA.', '8 Department of Surgery, Stanford University School of Medicine, 300 Pasteur Drive Stanford, California 94305-2200, USA.']","Imon Banerjee, Kevin Li, Martin Seneviratne, Michelle Ferrari, Tina Seto, James D Brooks, Daniel L Rubin, Tina Hernandez-Boussard, ",JAMIA open,2019 Apr,natural language processing; neural word embedding; patient-centered outcomes; prostate cancer; text mining.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31032481

Hence, this increasingly popular channel of scientific discussion itself needs to be explored to inform current controversies, record the historical moment, improve methods communication, and address equity issues.

How do they discuss individual researchers, and how do readers respond? What are some impacts?

Bloggers mostly represented psychology's traditional leaderships' demographic categories: primarily male, mid- to late career, associated with American institutions, White, and with established citation counts. As methods blogs, their posts mainly concern statistics, replication (particularly statistical power), and research findings. The few posts that mentioned individual researchers substantially focused on replication issues; they received more views, social-media impact, comments, and citations. Male individual researchers were mentioned much more often than female researchers.

This represents a reduction of 27% from the baseline. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      This approach enabled us to identify needle detachments we would not have otherwise found (""solicited""). However, it likely resulted in incomplete outcome ascertainment. While this may have resulted in lower overall rates, it did not bias the comparison of the baseline and follow-up studies. The results showed that the redesigned Risperdal® CONSTA® kit reduced the incidence of needle detachment events in the VA. Funding:

1384,Right inferior frontal gyrus: An integrative hub in tonal bilinguals,"Right hemispheric dominance in tonal bilingualism is still controversial. In this study, we investigated hemispheric dominance in 30 simultaneous Bai-Mandarin tonal bilinguals and 28 Mandarin monolinguals using multimodal neuroimaging. Resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) analysis was first performed to reveal the changes of functional connections within the language-related network. Voxel-based morphology (VBM) and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analyses were then used to identify bilinguals' alterations in gray matter volume (GMV) and fractional anisotropy (FA) of white matter, respectively. RSFC analyses revealed significantly increased functional connections of the right pars-orbital part of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) with right caudate, right pars-opercular part of IFG, and left inferior temporal gyrus in Bai-Mandarin bilinguals compared to monolinguals. VBM and TBSS analyses further identified significantly greater GMV in right pars-triangular IFG and increased FA in right superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) in bilinguals than in monolinguals. Taken together, these results demonstrate the integrative role of the right IFG in tonal language processing of bilinguals. Our findings suggest that the intrinsic language network in simultaneous tonal bilinguals differs from that of monolinguals in terms of both function and structure.","['1 Key Laboratory for Neurolnformation of Ministry of Education, School of Life Science and Technology, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.', '2 School of Foreign Languages, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.', '3 Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, China.', '4 Department of Radiology, Kunming Medical University First Affiliated Hospital, Kunming, China.', '5 Center for Language and Brain, Shenzhen Institute of Neuroscience, Shenzhen, 518057, China.']","Zhao Gao, Xin Guo, Cirong Liu, Yin Mo, Jiaojian Wang, ",Human brain mapping,2020,gray matter volume; language network; resting-state; simultaneous tonal bilingual; white matter.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31957933
1385,"The project for objective measures using computational psychiatry technology (PROMPT): Rationale, design, and methodology","Introduction:
      
    

    
      Depressive and neurocognitive disorders are debilitating conditions that account for the leading causes of years lived with disability worldwide. However, there are no biomarkers that are objective or easy-to-obtain in daily clinical practice, which leads to difficulties in assessing treatment response and developing new drugs. New technology allows quantification of features that clinicians perceive as reflective of disorder severity, such as facial expressions, phonic/speech information, body motion, daily activity, and sleep. Methods:
      
    

    
      Major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and major and minor neurocognitive disorders as well as healthy controls are recruited for the study. A psychiatrist/psychologist conducts conversational 10-min interviews with participants ≤10 times within up to five years of follow-up. Interviews are recorded using RGB and infrared cameras, and an array microphone. As an option, participants are asked to wear wrist-band type devices during the observational period. Various software is used to process the raw video, voice, infrared, and wearable device data. A machine learning approach is used to predict the presence of symptoms, severity, and the improvement/deterioration of symptoms. Discussion:
      
    

    
      The overall goal of this proposed study, the Project for Objective Measures Using Computational Psychiatry Technology (PROMPT), is to develop objective, noninvasive, and easy-to-use biomarkers for assessing the severity of depressive and neurocognitive disorders in the hopes of guiding decision-making in clinical settings as well as reducing the risk of clinical trial failure. Challenges may include the large variability of samples, which makes it difficult to extract the features that commonly reflect disorder severity. Trial registration:

1386,Assessment of the Robustness of Convolutional Neural Networks in Labeling Noise by Using Chest X-Ray Images From Multiple Centers,"Background:
      
    

    
      Computer-aided diagnosis on chest x-ray images using deep learning is a widely studied modality in medicine. Many studies are based on public datasets, such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) dataset and the Stanford CheXpert dataset. However, these datasets are preprocessed by classical natural language processing, which may cause a certain extent of label errors. Objective:
      
    

    
      This study aimed to investigate the robustness of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for binary classification of posteroanterior chest x-ray through random incorrect labeling. Methods:
      
    

    
      We trained and validated the CNN architecture with different noise levels of labels in 3 datasets, namely, Asan Medical Center-Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (AMC-SNUBH), NIH, and CheXpert, and tested the models with each test set. Diseases of each chest x-ray in our dataset were confirmed by a thoracic radiologist using computed tomography (CT). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and area under the curve (AUC) were evaluated in each test. Randomly chosen chest x-rays of public datasets were evaluated by 3 physicians and 1 thoracic radiologist. Results:
      
    

    
      In comparison with the public datasets of NIH and CheXpert, where AUCs did not significantly drop to 16%, the AUC of the AMC-SNUBH dataset significantly decreased from 2% label noise. Evaluation of the public datasets by 3 physicians and 1 thoracic radiologist showed an accuracy of 65%-80%. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis model is sensitive to label noise, and computer-aided diagnosis with inaccurate labels is not credible. Furthermore, open datasets such as NIH and CheXpert need to be distilled before being used for deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis.","['1 Department of Biomedical Engineering, College of Medicine, University of Ulsan, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', '2 Department of Convergence Medicine, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', '3 Department of Radiology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', '4 Department of Radiology, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seongnam, Republic of Korea.', '5 Department of Health Screening and Promotion Center, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']","Ryoungwoo Jang, Namkug Kim, Miso Jang, Kyung Hwa Lee, Sang Min Lee, Kyung Hee Lee, Han Na Noh, Joon Beom Seo, ",JMIR medical informatics,2020,CheXpert dataset; NIH dataset; convolutional neural network; deep learning; robustness.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32749222
1387,Pragmatic considerations for fostering reproducible research in artificial intelligence,"Artificial intelligence and deep learning methods hold great promise in the medical sciences in areas such as enhanced tumor identification from radiographic images, and natural language processing to extract complex information from electronic health records. Scientific review of AI algorithms has involved reproducibility, in which investigators share protocols, raw data, and programming codes. Within the realm of medicine, reproducibility introduces important challenges, including risk to patient privacy, challenges in reproducing results, and questions regarding ownership and financial value of large medical datasets. Scientific review, however, mandates some form of resolution of these inherent conflicts.

1388,Using Social Media to Uncover Treatment Experiences and Decisions in Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia or Myelodysplastic Syndrome Who Are Ineligible for Intensive Chemotherapy: Patient-Centric Qualitative Data Analysis,"Background:
      
    

    
      Until recently, treatment options were limited for patients with acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (AML and MDS) who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. Owing to the condition's rapid progression, it is difficult to identify what is most important to patients when making treatment decisions. Patients' needs can be better addressed by gaining a deeper understanding of their perspectives, which is valuable in the decision-making process. The Food and Drug Administration recently encouraged the use of social media as a tool to gain insight on patients' perspectives regarding symptoms experienced and the impacts of their disease. Objective:
      
    

    
      This study aimed to use disease-specific social media posts by patients with AML or MDS who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy and their caregivers to capture factors they feel are most important, and to provide current evidence to inform and characterize these perspectives. Methods:
      
    

    
      Posts by patients with AML or MDS and their caregivers were extracted from publicly available discussions on 3 large AML- or MDS-specific sites. These posts were manually reviewed to only include patients who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. A total of 1443 posts from 220 AML patients/caregivers and 2733 posts from 127 MDS patients/caregivers met the study inclusion criteria. A qualitative data analysis (QDA) of a sample of 85 patients'/caregivers' posts was conducted to identify themes, and a targeted QDA of posts from 79 users focused on treatment decision discussions. Posts were manually reviewed, and relevant text segments were coded and grouped into categories and overall themes. Results:
      
    

    
      Eighty-six percent (73/85) of users in the overall QDA had relevant information about the key objectives. The most commonly discussed treatment experience theme was the humanistic burden of AML or MDS in terms of emotional/physical impact and impact on family (86%, 63/73 of users), followed by treatment decisions (56%, 41/73) and unmet needs (50%, 37/73). In the QDA of treatment decisions, 60 posts from 45 users contained relevant information. Patients commonly reported the desire to reach specific milestones, including birthdays and weddings. They wished for a better quality of life over quantity of life, did not want the risk of suffering from side effects, and expressed a clear preference to be at home rather than in a hospital or care home. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      This study was a novel application of disease-specific social media. It highlighted experiences in the current treatment of AML and MDS, including information gaps, patient/caregiver uncertainty, and the importance of understanding patients'/caregivers' goals and opinions. A clear finding from this research was the importance of reaching certain personal life goals and being at home with family and friends. The analysis showed that patients/caregivers face additional challenges, including humanistic impacts and a lack of information regarding treatment options.","['1 Evidera, London, United Kingdom.', '2 Pfizer, New York, NY, United States.']","Alison Booth, Timothy Bell, Sonia Halhol, Shiyu Pan, Verna Welch, Evie Merinopoulou, Dimitra Lambrelli, Andrew Cox, ",Journal of medical Internet research,2019,acute; health-related quality of life; leukemia; myelodysplastic syndromes; myeloid; natural language processing; patient preference; patient-centric; qualitative research; social media.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31755871
1389,Detection of Bleeding Events in Electronic Health Record Notes Using Convolutional Neural Network Models Enhanced With Recurrent Neural Network Autoencoders: Deep Learning Approach,"Background:
      
    

    
      Bleeding events are common and critical and may cause significant morbidity and mortality. High incidences of bleeding events are associated with cardiovascular disease in patients on anticoagulant therapy. Prompt and accurate detection of bleeding events is essential to prevent serious consequences. As bleeding events are often described in clinical notes, automatic detection of bleeding events from electronic health record (EHR) notes may improve drug-safety surveillance and pharmacovigilance. Objective:
      
    

    
      We aimed to develop a natural language processing (NLP) system to automatically classify whether an EHR note sentence contains a bleeding event. Methods:
      
    

    
      We expert annotated 878 EHR notes (76,577 sentences and 562,630 word-tokens) to identify bleeding events at the sentence level. This annotated corpus was used to train and validate our NLP systems. We developed an innovative hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) autoencoder (HCLA) model that integrates a CNN architecture with a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) autoencoder model to leverage large unlabeled EHR data. Results:
      
    

    
      HCLA achieved the best area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.957) and F1 score (0.938) to identify whether a sentence contains a bleeding event, thereby surpassing the strong baseline support vector machines and other CNN and autoencoder models. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      By incorporating a supervised CNN model and a pretrained unsupervised BiLSTM autoencoder, the HCLA achieved high performance in detecting bleeding events.","['1 College of Information and Computer Science, University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, MA, United States.', '2 Department of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts Lowell, Lowell, MA, United States.', '3 Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, United States.', '4 Department of Veterans Affairs, Center for Medication Safety, Hines, IL, United States.', '5 Cardiology Division, Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, United States.', '6 Center for Healthcare Organization and Implementation Research, Bedford Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Bedford, MA, United States.']","Rumeng Li, Baotian Hu, Feifan Liu, Weisong Liu, Francesca Cunningham, David D McManus, Hong Yu, ",JMIR medical informatics,2019,BiLSTM; autoencoder; bleeding; convolutional neural networks; electronic health record.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30735140
1390,The immunotherapeutic effects of recombinant Bacillus Calmette-Guérin resistant to antimicrobial peptides on bladder cancer cells,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      Although Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is the most widely used bladder cancer immunotherapy, innate immune responses involving antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) cause BCG failure and unwanted side effects. Here, we generated genetically modified BCG strains with improved immunotherapeutic effects by adding genes that confer evasion of AMPs. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      We constructed recombinant BCG (rBCG) strains expressing Streptococcal inhibitor of complement (Sic), which confers resistance to human α-defensin-1 and cathelicidin, and d-alanyl carrier protein ligase (dltA), which confers resistance to cationic AMPs. Sic and dltA were separately cloned into the pMV306 plasmid and introduced into BCG via electroporation. Then, the efficacy of the rBCGs was tested in a growth inhibition assay using two bladder cancer cell lines (5637, T24). Results:
      
    

    
      We confirmed the presence of cDNA segments corresponding to the Sic and dltA genes in total mRNA of the rBCG strains containing Sic (rBCG-Sic) and dltA (rBCG-dltA), and these rBCGs showed higher survival against AMPs. The growth inhibitory effects of rBCGs on bladder cancer cells were significantly enhanced compared to those of the parent BCG, and THP-1 migration also increased. After 8 h of infection, the levels of internalization were higher in rBCG-infected bladder cancer cells than in BCG-infected cells, and cells infected with rBCGs showed increased release of antitumor cytokines, such as IL-6/12, TNF-α, and INF-γ, resulting in inhibition of bacterial killing and immune modulation via antimicrobial peptides. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      rBCG-Sic and rBCG-dltA can effectively evade BCG-stimulated AMPs, and may be significantly improved immunotherapeutic tools to treat bladder cancer.","['1 Department of Urology, College of Medicine, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', '2 College of Medicine, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', '3 College of Pharmacy, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', '4 Genitourinary Cancer Branch, Research Institute, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Republic of Korea.', '5 Department of Urology, College of Medicine, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.

1391,"Literature on Wearable Technology for Connected Health: Scoping Review of Research Trends, Advances, and Barriers","Background:
      
    

    
      Wearable sensing and information and communication technologies are key enablers driving the transformation of health care delivery toward a new model of connected health (CH) care. The advances in wearable technologies in the last decade are evidenced in a plethora of original articles, patent documentation, and focused systematic reviews. Although technological innovations continuously respond to emerging challenges and technology availability further supports the evolution of CH solutions, the widespread adoption of wearables remains hindered. Objective:
      
    

    
      This study aimed to scope the scientific literature in the field of pervasive wearable health monitoring in the time interval from January 2010 to February 2019 with respect to four important pillars: technology, safety and security, prescriptive insight, and user-related concerns. The purpose of this study was multifold: identification of (1) trends and milestones that have driven research in wearable technology in the last decade, (2) concerns and barriers from technology and user perspective, and (3) trends in the research literature addressing these issues. Methods:
      
    

    
      This study followed the scoping review methodology to identify and process the available literature. As the scope surpasses the possibilities of manual search, we relied on the natural language processing tool kit to ensure an efficient and exhaustive search of the literature corpus in three large digital libraries: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, PubMed, and Springer. The search was based on the keywords and properties to be found in articles using the search engines of the digital libraries. Results:
      
    

    
      The annual number of publications in all segments of research on wearable technology shows an increasing trend from 2010 to February 2019. The technology-related topics dominated in the number of contributions, followed by research on information delivery, safety, and security, whereas user-related concerns were the topic least addressed. The literature corpus evidences milestones in sensor technology (miniaturization and placement), communication architectures and fifth generation (5G) cellular network technology, data analytics, and evolution of cloud and edge computing architectures. The research lag in battery technology makes energy efficiency a relevant consideration in the design of both sensors and network architectures with computational offloading. The most addressed user-related concerns were (technology) acceptance and privacy, whereas research gaps indicate that more efforts should be invested into formalizing clear use cases with timely and valuable feedback and prescriptive recommendations. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      This study confirms that applications of wearable technology in the CH domain are becoming mature and established as a scientific domain. The current research should bring progress to sustainable delivery of valuable recommendations, enforcement of privacy by design, energy-efficient pervasive sensing, seamless monitoring, and low-latency 5G communications. To complement technology achievements, future work involving all stakeholders providing research evidence on improved care pathways and cost-effectiveness of the CH model is needed.","['1 Faculty of Technical Sciences, University of Novi Sad, Novi Sad, Serbia.', '2 Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, Saints Cyril and Methodius University, Skopje, North Macedonia.', '3 Institute for Systems and Computer Engineering, Technology and Science, Faculty of Engineering, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal.', '4 Faculty of Health Sciences, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece.']","Tatjana Loncar-Turukalo, Eftim Zdravevski, José Machado da Silva, Ioanna Chouvarda, Vladimir Trajkovik, ",Journal of medical Internet research,2019,assisted living facilities; review; telemedicine; wearable technology.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31489843
1392,Does intra-uterine language experience modulate word stress processing? An ERP study,"Background:
      
    

    
      Preterm birth is associated with various risks, including delayed or atypical language development. The prenatal start of prosodic tuning may affect the processing of word stress, an important suprasegmental feature of spoken utterances. Aim:
      
    

    
      Our study focused on the expected contribution of intra-uterine experience to word stress processing. We aimed to demonstrate the hypothesized effect of intra-uterine sound exposition on stress sensitivity. Method:
      
    

    
      We recorded ERP responses of 34 preterm infants elicited by bisyllabic pseudo-words in two oddball conditions by switching the stress pattern (legal vs. illegal) and role (standard vs. deviant). Results:
      
    

    
      The mismatch responses found were synchronized to each syllable of the illegally stressed stimuli with no difference between pre- and full-term infants. However, the clear role of the preterm status was demonstrated by the exaggerated processing of the native stress information. The impact of intra-uterine exposure to prosody was confirmed by our finding that moderate-late preterm infants outperformed the very preterm ones. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Intra-uterine exposition to prosodic features appears to contribute to the emergence of stable long-term stress representation. When this tuning is missing it is considered a risk for the language acquisition process.","['1 Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Semmelweis University 1st Department of Paediatrics, Bókay János utca 53-54., H- 1083, Budapest, Hungary; Doctoral School of Psychology, Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Egry József utca 1., H-1111, Budapest, Hungary.

1393,Immune therapy of melanoma: Overview of therapeutic vaccines,"Melanoma is the most serious type of skin cancer which develops from the occurrence of genetic mutations in the melanocytes. Based on the features of melanoma tumors such as location, genetic profile and stage, there are several therapeutic strategies including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. However, because of the appearance resistance mechanisms, the efficiency of these treatments strategies may be reduced. It has been demonstrated that therapeutic monoclonal antibodies can improve the efficiency of melanoma therapies. Recently, several mAbs, such as nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and ipilimumab, were approved for the immunotherapy of melanoma. The antibodies inhibit immune checkpoint receptors such as CTL4 and pd-1.

1394,Low-frequency neural activity reflects rule-based chunking during speech listening,"Chunking is a key mechanism for sequence processing. Studies on speech sequences have suggested low-frequency cortical activity tracks spoken phrases, that is, chunks of words defined by tacit linguistic knowledge. Here, we investigate whether low-frequency cortical activity reflects a general mechanism for sequence chunking and can track chunks defined by temporarily learned artificial rules. The experiment records magnetoencephalographic (MEG) responses to a sequence of spoken words. To dissociate word properties from the chunk structures, two tasks separately require listeners to group pairs of semantically similar or semantically dissimilar words into chunks. In the MEG spectrum, a clear response is observed at the chunk rate. More importantly, the chunk-rate response is task-dependent. It is phase locked to chunk boundaries, instead of the semantic relatedness between words. The results strongly suggest that cortical activity can track chunks constructed based on task-related rules and potentially reflects a general mechanism for chunk-level representations.","['1 Key Laboratory for Biomedical Engineering of Ministry of Education, College of Biomedical Engineering and Instrument Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', '2 Research Center for Advanced Artificial Intelligence Theory, Zhejiang Lab, Hangzhou, China.']","Peiqing Jin, Yuhan Lu, Nai Ding, ",eLife,2020,chunking; human; magnetoencephalographic; neuroscience; speech sequence.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32310082
1395,Does orthographic processing emerge rapidly after learning a new script?,"Orthographic processing is characterized by location-invariant and location-specific processing (Grainger, 2018): (1) strings of letters are more vulnerable to transposition effects than the strings of symbols in same-different tasks (location-invariant processing); and (2) strings of letters, but not strings of symbols, show an initial position advantage in target-in-string identification tasks (location-specific processing). To examine the emergence of these two markers of orthographic processing, we conducted a same-different task and a target-in-string identification task with two unfamiliar scripts (pre-training experiments). Across six training sessions, participants learned to fluently read and write one of these scripts. The post-training experiments were parallel to the pre-training experiments. Results showed that the magnitude of the transposed-letter effect in the same-different task and the serial function in the target-in-string identification tasks were remarkably similar for the trained and untrained scripts. Thus, location-invariant and location-specific processing does not emerge rapidly after learning a new script; instead, they may require thorough experience with specific orthographic structures.","['1 Universitat de València, Spain.', '2 Basque Center on Brain, Cognition, and Language, Donostia, Spain.', '3 Universidad Nebrija, Spain.']","María Fernández-López, Ana Marcet, Manuel Perea, ","British journal of psychology (London, England : 1953)",2020,artificial script; first-letter advantage; letter position coding; orthographic processing; training.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32780425
1396,"Overuse of Cystoscopic Surveillance Among Patients With Low-risk Non-Muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer - A National Study of Patient, Provider, and Facility Factors","Objective:
      
    

    
      To understand cystoscopic surveillance practices among patients with low-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Methods:
      
    

    
      Using a validated natural language processing algorithm, we included patients newly diagnosed with low-risk (ie low-grade Ta) NMIBC from 2005 to 2011 in the VA. Patients were followed until cancer recurrence, death, last contact, or 2 years after diagnosis. Based on guidelines, surveillance overuse was defined as >1 cystoscopy if followed <1 year, >2 cystoscopies if followed 1 to <2 years, or >3 cystoscopies if followed for 2 years. We identified patient, provider, and facility factors associated with overuse using multilevel logistic regression. Results:
      
    

    
      Overuse occurred in 75% of patients (852/1135) - with an excess of 1846 more cystoscopies performed than recommended. Adjusting for 14 factors, overuse was associated with patient race (odds ratio [OR] 0.49, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.28, 0.85 unlisted race vs White), having 2 comorbidities (OR 1.60, 95% CI: 1.00, 2.55 vs no comorbidities), and earlier year of diagnosis (OR 2.50, 95% CI: 1.29, 4.83 for 2005 vs 2011, and OR 2.03, 95% CI: 1.11, 3.69 for 2006 vs 2011). On sensitivity analyses assuming all patients were diagnosed with multifocal or large low-grade tumors (ie, intermediate-risk), overuse would have still occurred in 45% of patients. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Overuse of cystoscopy among patients with low-risk NMIBC was common, raising concerns about bladder cancer surveillance cost and quality. However, few factors were associated with overuse. Further qualitative research is needed to identify other determinants of overuse not readily captured in administrative data.","['1 The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth College, Lebanon, NH.', '2 VA Salt Lake City Health Care System and the Division of Epidemiology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.', '3 The White River Junction VA Medical Center, White River Junction, VT.', '4 Section of Urology, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH.', '5 Section of Urology, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH; Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH.', '6 The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth College, Lebanon, NH; The White River Junction VA Medical Center, White River Junction, VT; Section of Urology, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH; Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH.

1397,Artificial intelligence and deep learning in ophthalmology,"Artificial intelligence (AI) based on deep learning (DL) has sparked tremendous global interest in recent years. DL has been widely adopted in image recognition, speech recognition and natural language processing, but is only beginning to impact on healthcare. In ophthalmology, DL has been applied to fundus photographs, optical coherence tomography and visual fields, achieving robust classification performance in the detection of diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity, the glaucoma-like disc, macular oedema and age-related macular degeneration. DL in ocular imaging may be used in conjunction with telemedicine as a possible solution to screen, diagnose and monitor major eye diseases for patients in primary care and community settings. Nonetheless, there are also potential challenges with DL application in ophthalmology, including clinical and technical challenges, explainability of the algorithm results, medicolegal issues, and physician and patient acceptance of the AI 'black-box' algorithms. DL could potentially revolutionise how ophthalmology is practised in the future. This review provides a summary of the state-of-the-art DL systems described for ophthalmic applications, potential challenges in clinical deployment and the path forward.","['1 Singapore Eye Research Institute, Singapore National Eye Center, Duke-NUS Medical School, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore daniel.ting.s.w@singhealth.com.sg.', '2 Department of Ophthalmology, Mt Sinai Hospital, New York City, New York, USA.', '3 Google AI Healthcare, Mountain View, California, USA.', '4 Casey Eye Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon, USA.', '5 Department of Ophthalmology, University of Washington, School of Medicine, Seattle, Washington, USA.', '6 Vitreo-retinal Department, Sankara Nethralaya, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.', '7 Singapore Eye Research Institute, Singapore National Eye Center, Duke-NUS Medical School, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', '8 Department of Ophthalmology, Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore.', '9 Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', '10 Center for Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', '11 Vitreo-retinal Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital, London, UK.']","Daniel Shu Wei Ting, Louis R Pasquale, Lily Peng, John Peter Campbell, Aaron Y Lee, Rajiv Raman, Gavin Siew Wei Tan, Leopold Schmetterer, Pearse A Keane, Tien Yin Wong, ",The British journal of ophthalmology,2019 Feb,glaucoma; imaging; public health; retina; telemedicine.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30361278

      Quantifying patient-physician cost conversations is challenging but important as out-of-pocket spending by US patients increases and patients are increasingly interested in discussing costs with their physicians. Objective:
      
    

    
      To characterize the prevalence of financial considerations documented in narrative clinical records of primary care encounters and their association with patient-level features. Design, setting, and participants:
      
    

    
      This cohort study applied natural language processing to narrative clinical notes obtained from electronic health records for adult primary care visits. Participants included patients aged 18 years and older with at least 1 primary care visit for an annual preventive examination at outpatient clinics at a US academic health system between January 2, 2008, and July 30, 2013. Data were analyzed in March 2019. Main outcomes and measures:
      
    

    
      Presence of financial content documented in narrative clinical notes. Results:
      
    

    
      The data set included 222 457 primary care visits for 46 244 individuals aged 18 years and older; 30 556 patients (60.1%) were female, 27 869 patients (60.3%) were white, and the mean (SD) age was 51.3 (17.7) years. In total, 6058 patients (13.1%) had at least 1 narrative clinical note indicating a financial conversation with their physician. In fully adjusted regression models, the odds of having a financial note were greater among patients with Medicare (odds ratio [OR], 1.27; 95% CI, 1.15-1.41; P < .001) or Medicaid (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.25-1.64; P < .001) insurance, those residing in zip codes with lower median income (OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.96-0.98; P < .001), black individuals (OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.28-1.53; P < .001), Hispanic individuals (OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.01-1.20; P = .03), and those who were unmarried (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.15-1.33; P < .001). Conclusions and relevance:
      
    

    
      Cost considerations were more likely to be noted in annual preventive examinations than previously observed in intensive care unit admissions, but still infrequently.

1399,A Collaborative Framework Based for Semantic Patients-Behavior Analysis and Highlight Topics Discovery of Alcoholic Beverages in Online Healthcare Forums,"Medical data in online groups and social media contain valuable information, which is provided by both healthcare professionals and patients. In fact, patients can talk freely and share their personal experiences. These resources are a valuable opportunity for health professionals who can access patients' opinions, as well as discussions between patients. Recently, the data processing of the health community and, how to extract knowledge is a significant technical challenge. There are many online group and forums that users can discuss on healthcare issues. Therefore, we can examine these text documents for discovering knowledge and evaluating patients' behavior based on their opinions and discussions. For example, there are many questions and answering groups on Twitter or Facebook. Given the importance of the research, in this paper, we present a semantic framework based on topic model (LDA) and Random forest(RF) to predict and retrieval latent topics of healthcare text-documents from an online forum. We extract our healthcare records (patient-questions) from patient.info website as a real dataset.

1400,A Systematic Framework for Analyzing Patient-Generated Narrative Data: Protocol for a Content Analysis,"Background:
      
    

    
      Patient narrative data in online health care forums (communities) are receiving increasing attention from the scientific community for implementing patient-centered care. Natural language processing (NLP) methods are gaining more and more attention because of the enormous data volume. However, state-of-the-art NLP still cannot meet the need of high-resolution analysis of patients' narratives. Manual qualitative analysis still plays a pivotal role in answering complicated research questions from analyzing patient narratives. Objective:
      
    

    
      This study aimed to develop a systematic framework for qualitative analysis of patient-generated narratives in online health care forums. Methods:
      
    

    
      Our systematic framework consists of 4 phases: (1) data collection, (2) data preparation, (3) content analysis, and (4) interpretation of the results. Data collection and data preparation phases are constructed based on text mining methods for identifying appropriate online health forums for data collection, differentiating posts of patients from other stakeholders, protecting patients' privacy, sampling, and choosing the unit of analysis. Content analysis phase is built on the framework method, which facilitates and accelerates the identification of patterns and themes by an interdisciplinary research team. In the end, the focus of interpretation of the results phase is to measure the data quality and interpret the findings regarding the dimensions and aspects of patients' experiences and concerns in their original contexts. Results:
      
    

    
      We demonstrated the usability of the proposed systematic framework using 2 case studies: one on determining factors affecting patients' attitudes toward antidepressants and another on identifying the disease management strategies in patient with diabetes facing financial difficulties. The framework provides a clear step-by-step process for systematic content analysis of patient narratives and produces high-quality structured results that can be used for describing patterns or regularities in patients' experiences, generating and testing hypotheses, and identifying areas of improvement in the health care systems. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The systematic framework is a rigorous and standardized method for qualitative analysis of patient narratives. Findings obtained through such a process indicate authentic dimensions and aspects of patient experiences and shed light on patients' concerns, needs, preferences, and values, which are the core of patient-centered care.

1401,Negative Symptoms in Early-Onset Psychosis and Their Association With Antipsychotic Treatment Failure,"The prevalence of negative symptoms (NS) at first episode of early-onset psychosis (EOP), and their effect on psychosis prognosis is unclear. In a sample of 638 children with EOP (aged 10-17 y, 51% male), we assessed (1) the prevalence of NS at first presentation to mental health services and (2) whether NS predicted eventual development of multiple treatment failure (MTF) prior to the age of 18 (defined by initiation of a third trial of novel antipsychotic due to prior insufficient response, intolerable adverse-effects or non-adherence). Data were extracted from the electronic health records held by child inpatient and community-based services in South London, United Kingdom. Natural Language Processing tools were used to measure the presence of Marder Factor NS and antipsychotic use. The association between presenting with ≥2 NS and the development of MTF over a 5-year period was modeled using Cox regression. Out of the 638 children, 37.5% showed ≥2 NS at first presentation, and 124 (19.3%) developed MTF prior to the age of 18. The presence of NS at first episode was significantly associated with MTF (adjusted hazard ratio 1.62, 95% CI 1.07-2.46; P = .02) after controlling for a number of potential confounders including psychosis diagnostic classification, positive symptoms, comorbid depression, and family history of psychosis. Other factors associated with MTF included comorbid autism spectrum disorder, older age at first presentation, Black ethnicity, and family history of psychosis. In EOP, NS at first episode are prevalent and may help identify a subset of children at higher risk of responding poorly to antipsychotics.","[""1 Department of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London & NIHR South London and Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre, UK."", '2 South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, UK.', ""3 Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Institute of Psychiatry Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, UK."", ""4 Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry Psychology Neuroscience, King's College London & NIHR South London and Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre, UK."", '5 University of Exeter Medical School, UK.', '6 Department of Psychiatry, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.', '7 Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Department, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón, IiSGM, School of Medicine, Universidad Complutense, CIBERSAM, Spain.']","Johnny Downs, Harry Dean, Suzannah Lechler, Nicola Sears, Rashmi Patel, Hitesh Shetty, Matthew Hotopf, Tamsin Ford, Marinos Kyriakopoulos, Covadonga M Diaz-Caneja, Celso Arango, James H MacCabe, Richard D Hayes, Laura Pina-Camacho, ",Schizophrenia bulletin,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29370404

Such spread of misinformation is masking healthy behaviors and promoting erroneous practices that increase the spread of the virus and ultimately result in poor physical and mental health outcomes among individuals. Myriad incidents of mishaps caused by these rumors have been reported globally. To address this issue, the frontline healthcare providers should be equipped with the most recent research findings and accurate information. The mass media, healthcare organization, community-based organizations, and other important stakeholders should build strategic partnerships and launch common platforms for disseminating authentic public health messages. Also, advanced technologies like natural language processing or data mining approaches should be applied in the detection and removal of online content with no scientific basis from all social media platforms. Furthermore, these practices should be controlled with regulatory and law enforcement measures alongside ensuring telemedicine-based services providing accurate information on COVID-19.","['1 Department of Health Promotion and Community Health Sciences, Texas A&M School of Public Health, College Station, TX, USA.', '2 Save the Children, Dhaka, Bangladesh.']","Samia Tasnim, Md Mahbub Hossain, Hoimonty Mazumder, ",Journal of preventive medicine and public health = Yebang Uihakhoe chi,2020 May,COVID-19; Health impacts; Misinformation; Social media.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32498140
1404,Metabolite AutoPlotter - an application to process and visualise metabolite data in the web browser,"Background:
      
    

    
      Metabolomics is gaining popularity as a standard tool for the investigation of biological systems. Yet, parsing metabolomics data in the absence of in-house computational scientists can be overwhelming and time-consuming. As a consequence of manual data processing, the results are often not analysed in full depth, so potential novel findings might get lost. Methods:
      
    

    
      To tackle this problem, we developed Metabolite AutoPlotter, a tool to process and visualise quantified metabolite data. Other than with bulk data visualisations, such as heat maps, the aim of the tool is to generate single plots for each metabolite. For this purpose, it reads as input pre-processed metabolite-intensity tables and accepts different experimental designs, with respect to the number of metabolites, conditions and replicates. The code was written in the R-scripting language and wrapped into a shiny application that can be run online in a web browser on https://mpietzke.shinyapps.io/autoplotter. Results:
      
    

    
      We demonstrate the main features and the ease of use with two different metabolite datasets, for quantitative experiments and for stable isotope tracing experiments. We show how the plots generated by the tool can be interactively modified with respect to plot type, colours, text labels and the shown statistics. We also demonstrate the application towards 13C-tracing experiments and the seamless integration of natural abundance correction, which facilitates the better interpretation of stable isotope tracing experiments. The output of the tool is a zip-file containing one single plot for each metabolite as well as restructured tables that can be used for further analysis. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      With the help of Metabolite AutoPlotter, it is now possible to simplify data processing and visualisation for a wide audience. High-quality plots from complex data can be generated in a short time by pressing a few buttons. This offers dramatic improvements over manual analysis. It is significantly faster and allows researchers to spend more time interpreting the results or to perform follow-up experiments. Further, this eliminates potential copy-and-paste errors or tedious repetitions when things need to be changed. We are sure that this tool will help to improve and speed up scientific discoveries.","['1 Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute, Switchback Road, Bearsden, Glasgow, G61 1BD UK.', '2 Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.']","Matthias Pietzke, Alexei Vazquez, ",Cancer & metabolism,2020,Automatic; Graphs; Metabolites; Metabolomics; Plots; Processing; Visualisation.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32670572
1405,A Virtual Agent to Support Individuals Living With Physical and Mental Comorbidities: Co-Design and Acceptability Testing,"Background:
      
    

    
      Individuals living with long-term physical health conditions frequently experience co-occurring mental health problems. This comorbidity has a significant impact on an individual's levels of emotional distress, health outcomes, and associated health care utilization. As health care services struggle to meet demand and care increasingly moves to the community, digital tools are being promoted to support patients to self-manage their health. One such technology is the autonomous virtual agent (chatbot, conversational agent), which uses artificial intelligence (AI) to process the user's written or spoken natural language and then to select or construct the corresponding appropriate responses. Objective:
      
    

    
      This study aimed to co-design the content, functionality, and interface modalities of an autonomous virtual agent to support self-management for patients with an exemplar long-term condition (LTC; chronic pulmonary obstructive disease [COPD]) and then to assess the acceptability and system content. Methods:
      
    

    
      We conducted 2 co-design workshops and a proof-of-concept implementation of an autonomous virtual agent with natural language processing capabilities. This implementation formed the basis for video-based scenario testing of acceptability with adults with a diagnosis of COPD and health professionals involved in their care. Results:
      
    

    
      Adults (n=6) with a diagnosis of COPD and health professionals (n=5) specified 4 priority self-management scenarios for which they would like to receive support: at the time of diagnosis (information provision), during acute exacerbations (crisis support), during periods of low mood (emotional support), and for general self-management (motivation). From the scenario testing, 12 additional adults with COPD felt the system to be both acceptable and engaging, particularly with regard to internet-of-things capabilities. They felt the system would be particularly useful for individuals living alone. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Patients did not explicitly separate mental and physical health needs, although the content they developed for the virtual agent had a clear psychological approach. Supported self-management delivered via an autonomous virtual agent was acceptable to the participants. A co-design process has allowed the research team to identify key design principles, content, and functionality to underpin an autonomous agent for delivering self-management support to older adults living with COPD and potentially other LTCs.","['1 School of Health and Related Research, The University of Sheffield, Sheffield, United Kingdom.', '2 Centre for Assistive Technology and Connected Healthcare, The University of Sheffield, Sheffield, United Kingdom.', '3 Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care Yorkshire and Humber, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, National Institute of Health, Sheffield, United Kingdom.', '4 Lab4Living, Art and Design Research Centre, Sheffield Hallam University, Sheffield, United Kingdom.', '5 Department of Computer Science, The University of Sheffield, Sheffield, United Kingdom.', '6 Department of Psychology, The University of Sheffield, Sheffield, United Kingdom.']","Katherine Easton, Stephen Potter, Remi Bec, Matthew Bennion, Heidi Christensen, Cheryl Grindell, Bahman Mirheidari, Scott Weich, Luc de Witte, Daniel Wolstenholme, Mark S Hawley, ",Journal of medical Internet research,2019,COPD; artificial intelligence; chatbot; chronic illness; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; comorbidity; computer-assisted therapy; conversational agent; mental health; self-management; virtual systems.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31148545
1406,AdaptAhead Optimization Algorithm for Learning Deep CNN Applied to MRI Segmentation,"Deep learning is one of the subsets of machine learning that is widely used in artificial intelligence (AI) field such as natural language processing and machine vision. The deep convolution neural network (DCNN) extracts high-level concepts from low-level features and it is appropriate for large volumes of data. In fact, in deep learning, the high-level concepts are defined by low-level features. Previously, in optimization algorithms, the accuracy achieved for network training was less and high-cost function. In this regard, in this study, AdaptAhead optimization algorithm was developed for learning DCNN with robust architecture in relation to the high volume data. The proposed optimization algorithm was validated in multi-modality MR images of BRATS 2015 and BRATS 2016 data sets. Comparison of the proposed optimization algorithm with other commonly used methods represents the improvement of the performance of the proposed optimization algorithm on the relatively large dataset. Using the Dice similarity metric, we report accuracy results on the BRATS 2015 and BRATS 2016 brain tumor segmentation challenge dataset. Results showed that our proposed algorithm is significantly more accurate than other methods as a result of its deep and hierarchical extraction.","['1 Department of Computer Engineering, Rasht Branch, Islamic Azad University, Rasht, Iran.', '2 Department of Computer Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Guilan, Rasht, Iran. shahbahrami@guilan.ac.ir.']","Farnaz Hoseini, Asadollah Shahbahrami, Peyman Bayat, ",Journal of digital imaging,2019 Feb,Convolutional neural networks; Deep convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; MRI segmentation; Optimization algorithm.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30039425

In the present study, we investigated whether this pattern generalizes to deaf Swedish Sign Language (SSL) users. British and SSLs have a largely overlapping phoneme inventory but are mutually unintelligible because lexical overlap is small. This is important because it means that even when signs lexicalized in BSL are unintelligible to users of SSL they are usually still phonologically acceptable. During fMRI scanning, deaf users of the two different sign languages monitored signs that were lexicalized in either one or both of those languages for phonologically contrastive elements. Neural activation patterns relating to different linguistic levels of processing were similar across SLs; in particular, we found no effect of lexicality, supporting the notion that apparent lexicality effects on sublexical processing of speech may be driven by orthographic strategies. As expected, we found an effect of phonology but not iconicity. Further, there was a difference in neural activation between the two groups in a motion-processing region of the left occipital cortex, possibly driven by cultural differences, such as education. Importantly, this difference was not modulated by the linguistic characteristics of the material, underscoring the robustness of the neural activation patterns relating to different linguistic levels of processing.","['1 Linnaeus Centre HEAD, Swedish Institute for Disability Research, Department of Behavioural Sciences and Learning, Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden.', '2 Deafness, Cognition and Language Research Centre, Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London, London, United Kingdom.', '3 School of Psychology, University of Crete, Rethymno, Greece.', '4 Department of Philosophy, Saarland University, Saarbrücken, Germany.', '5 School of Psychology, University of East Anglia, Norwich, United Kingdom.', '6 Division of Neuroscience & Experimental Psychology, School of Biological Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.']","Mary Rudner, Eleni Orfanidou, Lena Kästner, Velia Cardin, Bencie Woll, Cheryl M Capek, Jerker Rönnberg, ",Frontiers in human neuroscience,2019,iconicity; language processing; lexicality; phonology; semantics; sign language.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31695602
1408,Integrated Cognitive Assessment: Speed and Accuracy of Visual Processing as a Reliable Proxy to Cognitive Performance,"Various mental disorders are accompanied by some degree of cognitive impairment. Particularly in neurodegenerative disorders, cognitive impairment is the phenotypical hallmark of the disease. Effective, accurate and timely cognitive assessment is key to early diagnosis of this family of mental disorders. Current standard-of-care techniques for cognitive assessment are primarily paper-based, and need to be administered by a healthcare professional; they are additionally language and education-dependent and typically suffer from a learning bias. These tests are thus not ideal for large-scale pro-active cognitive screening and disease progression monitoring. We developed the Integrated Cognitive Assessment (referred to as CGN_ICA), a 5-minute computerized cognitive assessment tool based on a rapid visual categorization task, in which a series of carefully selected natural images of varied difficulty are presented to participants. Overall 448 participants, across a wide age-range with different levels of education took the CGN_ICA test. We compared participants' CGN_ICA test results with a variety of standard pen-and-paper tests, such as Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), that are routinely used to assess cognitive performance. CGN_ICA had excellent test-retest reliability, showed convergent validity with the standard-of-care cognitive tests used here, and demonstrated to be suitable for micro-monitoring of cognitive performance.","['1 Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. skhaligh@mit.edu.', '2 Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Cell Science Research Center, Royan Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Technology, ACECR, Tehran, Iran. skhaligh@mit.edu.', '3 Cognetivity ltd, London, UK. skhaligh@mit.edu.', '4 Cognetivity ltd, London, UK.', '5 University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.', '6 School of Cognitive Sciences (SCS), Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences (IPM), Tehran, Iran.', '7 Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Cell Science Research Center, Royan Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Technology, ACECR, Tehran, Iran.', '8 South London & Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.']","Seyed-Mahdi Khaligh-Razavi, Sina Habibi, Maryam Sadeghi, Haniye Marefat, Mahdiyeh Khanbagi, Seyed Massood Nabavi, Elham Sadeghi, Chris Kalafatis, ",Scientific reports,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30705371
1409,"Adapting State-of-the-Art Deep Language Models to Clinical Information Extraction Systems: Potentials, Challenges, and Solutions","Background:
      
    

    
      Deep learning (DL) has been widely used to solve problems with success in speech recognition, visual object recognition, and object detection for drug discovery and genomics. Natural language processing has achieved noticeable progress in artificial intelligence. This gives an opportunity to improve on the accuracy and human-computer interaction of clinical informatics. However, due to difference of vocabularies and context between a clinical environment and generic English, transplanting language models directly from up-to-date methods to real-world health care settings is not always satisfactory. Moreover, the legal restriction on using privacy-sensitive patient records hinders the progress in applying machine learning (ML) to clinical language processing. Objective:
      
    

    
      The aim of this study was to investigate 2 ways to adapt state-of-the-art language models to extracting patient information from free-form clinical narratives to populate a handover form at a nursing shift change automatically for proofing and revising by hand: first, by using domain-specific word representations and second, by using transfer learning models to adapt knowledge from general to clinical English. We have described the practical problem, composed it as an ML task known as information extraction, proposed methods for solving the task, and evaluated their performance. Methods:
      
    

    
      First, word representations trained from different domains served as the input of a DL system for information extraction. Second, the transfer learning model was applied as a way to adapt the knowledge learned from general text sources to the task domain. The goal was to gain improvements in the extraction performance, especially for the classes that were topically related but did not have a sufficient amount of model solutions available for ML directly from the target domain. A total of 3 independent datasets were generated for this task, and they were used as the training (101 patient reports), validation (100 patient reports), and test (100 patient reports) sets in our experiments. Results:
      
    

    
      Our system is now the state-of-the-art in this task. Domain-specific word representations improved the macroaveraged F1 by 3.4%. Transferring the knowledge from general English corpora to the task-specific domain contributed a further 7.1% improvement. The best performance in populating the handover form with 37 headings was the macroaveraged F1 of 41.6% and F1 of 81.1% for filtering out irrelevant information. Performance differences between this system and its baseline were statistically significant (P<.001; Wilcoxon test). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      To our knowledge, our study is the first attempt to transfer models from general deep models to specific tasks in health care and gain a significant improvement. As transfer learning shows its advantage over other methods, especially on classes with a limited amount of training data, less experts' time is needed to annotate data for ML, which may enable good results even in resource-poor domains.","['1 Research School of Computer Science, College of Engineering and Computer Science, The Australian National University, Canberra, Australia.', '2 Machine Learning Group, Data61, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Canberra, Australia.', '3 Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Canberra, Canberra, Australia.', '4 Department of Future Technologies, Faculty of Science and Engineering, University of Turku, Turku, Finland.']","Liyuan Zhou, Hanna Suominen, Tom Gedeon, ",JMIR medical informatics,2019,artificial intelligence; computer systems; deep learning; information storage and retrieval; medical informatics; nursing records; patient handoff.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31021325
1410,Creative utterances about person-centered care among future health care professionals are related to reward dependence rather than to a creative personality profile,"Background:
      
    

    
      Creativity can be defined as the creation of something that is novel, useful, and valuable for society (i.e., high-level creativity) and/or everyday life. In this context, people have implicit theories of creativity as being either non-malleable (i.e., a fixed creative mindset) or malleable (i.e., a growth creative mindset). Our aim was twofold: (1) to test an improved creative mindset priming paradigm (i.e., adding high-level/everyday creativity perspectives and using an organizational important task) by assessing if participants used different ways to answer to the prime and (2) to analyse the relationship between personality and creative utterances regarding an important topic in participants' future professions. Method:
      
    

    
      Students (N = 73) from different health care professions were randomly assigned to the non-malleable or malleable creative mindset priming paradigm (i.e., fixed vs. growth) and then asked to write about (a) their own creativity, (b) person-centered care in their professions (i.e., unusual use test), and to (c) self-rate their personality (Temperament and Character Inventory). We used natural language processing methods (i.e., Latent Semantic Algorithm) to analyse participants' responses in the different conditions and also responses in relation to self-reported personality. Results:
      
    

    
      The fixed versus growth condition was predicted (r = .55, p < 0.0001), following Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons by participants' descriptions about creativity. Although the condition was not predicted (r = .07, p < 0.2755) by participants' utterances about person-centered care, a t-test suggested that participants used words that were semantically different depending on the condition they were randomly assigned to (t(2371) = 5.82, p = .0000). For instance, participants in the growth condition used verbs more frequently, while those in the fixed condition used the personal pronoun I more often. Finally, only the temperament trait of reward dependence (r = .32, p < 0.01) predicted the person-centered care utterances. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      We argue that the paradigm successfully primed participants to write about creativity and person-centered care using narratives with different semantic content. However, individuals' ambition to be socially accepted, rather than creative personality traits, elicited the utterances about person-centered care. The creative mindset priming paradigm presented here along language processing methods might be useful for measuring creative potential at work. We suggest that if health care personnel's notions of the activities related to care are generated from their drive to be socially accepted and not from a truly creative profile, the activities might be self-serving and not person-centered.","['1 Blekinge Centre of Competence, Region Blekinge, Blekinge, Sweden.', '2 Department of Psychology, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', '3 Network for Empowerment and Well-Being, Sweden.', '4 Linnaeus University, Department of Health and Caring Science, Kalmar, Sweden.', '5 Department of Psychology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.']","Danilo Garcia, Izabella Jedel, Max Rapp-Ricciardi, Erik Lindskär, Kristian Molander-Söderholm, Cecilia Fagerström, Sverker Sikström, ",Heliyon,2019,Health profession; Nursing; Psychology.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30963124
1411,Language comprehension in the social brain: Electrophysiological brain signals of social presence effects during syntactic and semantic sentence processing,"Although, evolutionarily, language emerged predominantly for social purposes, much has yet to be uncovered regarding how language processing is affected by social context. Social presence research studies the ways in which the presence of a conspecific affects processing, but has yet to be thoroughly applied to language processes. The principal aim of this study was to see how syntactic and semantic language processing might be subject to mere social presence effects by studying Event-Related brain Potentials (ERP). In a sentence correctness task, participants read sentences with a semantic or syntactic anomaly while being either alone or in the mere presence of a confederate. Compared to the alone condition, the presence condition was associated with an enhanced N400 component and a more centro-posterior LAN component (interpreted as an N400). The results seem to imply a boosting of heuristic language processing strategies, proper of lexico-semantic operations, which actually entails a shift in the strategy to process morphosyntactic violations, typically based on algorithmic or rule-based strategies. The effects cannot be related to increased arousal levels. The apparent enhancement of the activity in the precuneus while in presence of another person suggests that the effects conceivably relate to social cognitive and attentional factors. The present results suggest that understanding language comprehension would not be complete without considering the impact of social presence effects, inherent to the most natural and fundamental communicative scenarios.","['1 Cognitive Neuroscience Section, UCM-ISCIII Center for Human Evolution and Behavior, Madrid, Spain.', '2 Cognitive Neuroscience Section, UCM-ISCIII Center for Human Evolution and Behavior, Madrid, Spain; Department of Psychobiology & Behavioral Sciences Methods, Complutense University of Madrid, Madrid, Spain.

1412,Automating creativity assessment with SemDis: An open platform for computing semantic distance,"Creativity research requires assessing the quality of ideas and products. In practice, conducting creativity research often involves asking several human raters to judge participants' responses to creativity tasks, such as judging the novelty of ideas from the alternate uses task (AUT). Although such subjective scoring methods have proved useful, they have two inherent limitations-labor cost (raters typically code thousands of responses) and subjectivity (raters vary on their perceptions and preferences)-raising classic psychometric threats to reliability and validity. We sought to address the limitations of subjective scoring by capitalizing on recent developments in automated scoring of verbal creativity via semantic distance, a computational method that uses natural language processing to quantify the semantic relatedness of texts. In five studies, we compare the top performing semantic models (e.g., GloVe, continuous bag of words) previously shown to have the highest correspondence to human relatedness judgements. We assessed these semantic models in relation to human creativity ratings from a canonical verbal creativity task (AUT; Studies 1-3) and novelty/creativity ratings from two word association tasks (Studies 4-5). We find that a latent semantic distance factor-comprised of the common variance from five semantic models-reliably and strongly predicts human creativity and novelty ratings across a range of creativity tasks. We also replicate an established experimental effect in the creativity literature (i.e., the serial order effect) and show that semantic distance correlates with other creativity measures, demonstrating convergent validity. We provide an open platform to efficiently compute semantic distance, including tutorials and documentation ( https://osf.io/gz4fc/ ).","['1 Department of Psychology, Pennsylvania State University, 140 Moore Building, University Park, PA, 16802, USA. rebeaty@psu.edu.', '2 Department of Cognitive and Behavioral Science, Washington and Lee University, Lexington, VA, 24450, USA. johnsondr@wlu.edu.']","Roger E Beaty, Dan R Johnson, ",Behavior research methods,2020,Assessment; Creativity; Divergent thinking; Semantic distance; Word association.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32869137

1414,Using Twitter to Understand the Human Bowel Disease Community: Exploratory Analysis of Key Topics,"Background:
      
    

    
      Nowadays, the use of social media is part of daily life, with more and more people, including governments and health organizations, using at least one platform regularly. Social media enables users to interact among large groups of people that share the same interests and suffer the same afflictions. Notably, these channels promote the ability to find and share information about health and medical conditions. Objective:
      
    

    
      This study aimed to characterize the bowel disease (BD) community on Twitter, in particular how patients understand, discuss, feel, and react to the condition. The main questions were as follows: Which are the main communities and most influential users?; Where are the main content providers from?; What are the key biomedical and scientific topics under discussion? How are topics interrelated in patient communications?; How do external events influence user activity?; What kind of external sources of information are being promoted? Methods:
      
    

    
      To answer these questions, a dataset of tweets containing terms related to BD conditions was collected from February to August 2018, accounting for a total of 24,634 tweets from 13,295 different users. Tweet preprocessing entailed the extraction of textual contents, hyperlinks, hashtags, time, location, and user information. Missing and incomplete information about the user profiles was completed using different analysis techniques. Semantic tweet topic analysis was supported by a lexicon-based entity recognizer. Furthermore, sentiment analysis enabled a closer look into the opinions expressed in the tweets, namely, gaining a deeper understanding of patients' feelings and experiences. Results:
      
    

    
      Health organizations received most of the communication, whereas BD patients and experts in bowel conditions and nutrition were among those tweeting the most. In general, the BD community was mainly discussing symptoms, BD-related diseases, and diet-based treatments. Diarrhea and constipation were the most commonly mentioned symptoms, and cancer, anxiety disorder, depression, and chronic inflammations were frequently part of BD-related tweets. Most patient tweets discussed the bad side of BD conditions and other related conditions, namely, depression, diarrhea, and fibromyalgia. In turn, gluten-free diets and probiotic supplements were often mentioned in patient tweets expressing positive emotions. However, for the most part, tweets containing mentions to foods and diets showed a similar distribution of negative and positive sentiments because the effects of certain food components (eg, fiber, iron, and magnesium) were perceived differently, depending on the state of the disease and other personal conditions of the patients. The benefits of medical cannabis for the treatment of different chronic diseases were also highlighted. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      This study evidences that Twitter is becoming an influential space for conversation about bowel conditions, namely, patient opinions about associated symptoms and treatments. So, further qualitative and quantitative content analyses hold the potential to support decision making among health-related stakeholders, including the planning of awareness campaigns.","['1 Department of Computer Science, University of Vigo, Escuela Superior de Ingeniería Informática, Ourense, Spain.', '2 Biomedical Research Centre, Campus Universitario Lagoas-Marcosende, Vigo, Spain.', '3 Next Generation Computer Systems Group, School of Computer Engineering, Galicia Sur Health Research Institute, Galician Health Service - University of Vigo, Vigo, Spain.', '4 Centre of Biological Engineering, Campus de Gualtar, University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.']","Martín Pérez-Pérez, Gael Pérez-Rodríguez, Florentino Fdez-Riverola, Anália Lourenço, ",Journal of medical Internet research,2019,communication; data mining; inflammatory bowel diseases; infodemiology; irritable bowel syndrome; natural language processing; social media.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31411142
1415,Investigating Bullying as a Predictor of Suicidality in a Clinical Sample of Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder,"For typically developing adolescents, being bullied is associated with increased risk of suicidality. Although adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are at increased risk of both bullying and suicidality, there is very little research that examines the extent to which an experience of being bullied may increase suicidality within this specific population. To address this, we conducted a retrospective cohort study to investigate the longitudinal association between experiencing bullying and suicidality in a clinical population of 680 adolescents with ASD. Electronic health records of adolescents (13-17 years), using mental health services in South London, with a diagnosis of ASD were analyzed. Natural language processing was employed to identify mentions of bullying and suicidality in the free text fields of adolescents' clinical records. Cox regression analysis was employed to investigate the longitudinal relationship between bullying and suicidality outcomes. Reported experience of bullying in the first month of clinical contact was associated with an increased risk suicidality over the follow-up period (hazard ratio = 1.82; 95% confidence interval = 1.28-2.59). In addition, female gender, psychosis, affective disorder diagnoses, and higher intellectual ability were all associated with suicidality at follow-up. This study is the first to demonstrate the strength of longitudinal associations between bullying and suicidality in a clinical population of adolescents with ASD, using automated approaches to detect key life events within clinical records. Our findings provide support for identifying and dealing with bullying in schools, and for antibullying strategy's incorporation into wider suicide prevention programs for young people with ASD.

We enrolled 12 Hi-AVH with insight, 15 Hi-AVH without insight, and 15 AVH-free controls (Healthy controls). Global functional connectivity density (gFCD) mapping was used to estimate brain networks. We found that the most common alterations in both Hi-AVH groups were increased gFCD in superior parietal lobule and superior temporal gyrus. We also found that distinct brain functional patterns of Hi-AVH without insight comprised lower gFCD in the frontal lobe oculomotor area, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, supramarginal gyrus, primary auditory cortex, sensorimotor cortex, ventral anterior, and posterior cingulate Our pilot findings support the hypothesis that abnormal reciprocal action in the circuits for processing perception, memory, language, and attentional control may be pathological features of auditory verbal hallucinations.","['1 School of Mental Health, Jining Medical University, Jining, 272119, Shandong Province, China. chuanjunzhuotjmh@163.com.', ""2 Psychiatric-Neuroimaging-Genetics Laboratory, Wenzhou Seventh People's Hospital, Wenzhou, 325000, Zhejiang Province, China. chuanjunzhuotjmh@163.com."", '3 Psychiatric-Neuroimaging-Genetics-Comorbidity Laboratory, Tianjin Mental Health Centre, Tianjin Anding Hospital, Mental Health Teaching Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, 300222, China. chuanjunzhuotjmh@163.com.', '4 Department of Psychiatry, First Hospital/First Clinical Medical College of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China. chuanjunzhuotjmh@163.com.', '5 MDT Center for Cognitive Impairment and Sleep Disorders, First Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, 030001, China. chuanjunzhuotjmh@163.com.', '6 Department of Psychiatry, Changchun Sixth Hospital, Changchun, 130052, Jilin Province, China. chuanjunzhuotjmh@163.com.', '7 School of Mental Health, Jining Medical University, Jining, 272119, Shandong Province, China.', ""8 Psychiatric-Neuroimaging-Genetics Laboratory, Wenzhou Seventh People's Hospital, Wenzhou, 325000, Zhejiang Province, China."", '9 Psychiatric-Neuroimaging-Genetics-Comorbidity Laboratory, Tianjin Mental Health Centre, Tianjin Anding Hospital, Mental Health Teaching Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, 300222, China.', '10 Department of Psychiatry, First Hospital/First Clinical Medical College of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.', '11 MDT Center for Cognitive Impairment and Sleep Disorders, First Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, 030001, China.', '12 Department of Psychiatry, Changchun Sixth Hospital, Changchun, 130052, Jilin Province, China.', '13 Co-collaboration Laboratory of China and Canada, Xiamen Xianyue Hospital and University of Alberta, Xiamen, 361000, China.']","Chuanjun Zhuo, Feng Ji, Xiaodong Lin, Hongjun Tian, Lina Wang, Sha Liu, Hong Sang, Wenqiang Wang, Chunmian Chen, ",Brain imaging and behavior,2019,Auditory verbal hallucinations; Global functional connectivity density; Healthy individuals; Insight.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31834596
1417,Cognitive Processing Therapy for Veterans with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: What is the Median Effective Dose?,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) has been disseminated in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to treat posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Identifying the median effective dose (MED) of CPT, the number of sessions at which the probability of experiencing clinically meaningful improvement (CMI) is 50%, can assist with treatment. Method:
      
    

    
      From a cohort of Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans who received PTSD psychotherapy in VHA between 2001-2017, veterans who received CPT with available PTSD symptom outcomes (PTSD Checklist; PCL) were identified using natural language processing (n=26,189). Cox proportional hazards regression was used to examine how number of CPT sessions, together with covariates, influenced CMI (10-point PCL reduction). Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted to determine MED. Results:
      
    

    
      At eight sessions, there was a 50% probability of experiencing CMI. The Cox proportional hazard regression indicated a greater likelihood of CMI in fewer sessions for veterans who received individual-only CPT versus any group CPT (HR:1.31, 95%CI:1.23-1.39). Kaplan-Meier curves indicated a 50% probability of experiencing CMI at seven sessions for veterans who received individual-only CPT versus ten sessions for veterans receiving any group CPT. Limitations:
      
    

    
      PCL data was not available for all veterans who received CPT or at each potential assessment point. Not all veterans continued in CPT until CMI was observed. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The MED of CPT was eight sessions. Fewer sessions were needed to reach MED for veterans who received individual versus group CPT. These results may help those who treat, research, and are recovering from PTSD through accurately anchoring treatment expectations and providing a marker of initial treatment response.","['1 San Francisco Veterans Affairs Health Care System; Sierra Pacific Mental Illness Research, Education, and Clinical Center; University of California San Francisco School of Medicine.

1418,Isolating syntax in natural language: MEG evidence for an early contribution of left posterior temporal cortex,"Although the construction of syntactic structures is considered a fundamental component of language processing, insights concerning its neurobiological basis have remained elusive. This may be due, in part, to the inherent difficulty of isolating incremental syntax from other components of language, such as semantic composition. However, while pure manipulations of syntax are challenging to design, natural language grammars do have a sparse set of constructions presenting the possibility. Here we examined one such case, English post-nominal adjectives (mountain TALL enough for a strenuous hike), which were contrasted with semantically parallel but structurally simpler noun-adjective sequences in an MEG experiment. We observed a sharp activity increase in the left posterior temporal lobe (PTL) when syntactic composition was more straightforward, approximately 200 msec after adjective onset. The semantic fit between the noun and adjective was also varied, but this affected anterior temporal cortex, consistent with prior work. These findings offer a unique demonstration of the relevance of posterior temporal cortex for syntactic processing in natural language. We also present connectivity evidence that the syntax-related PTL responses were relayed to ipsilateral inferior frontal and anterior temporal regions. The combined results draw an initial picture of the rapid spatio-temporal dynamics of the syntactic and semantic composition network in sentence processing.","['1 NYUAD Institute, New York University Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; Department of Psychology, New York University, USA.

1419,The impact of a momentary language switch on bilingual reading: Intense at the switch but merciful downstream for L2 but not L1 readers,"We investigated whether cross-language activation is sensitive to shifting language demands and language experience during first and second language (i.e., L1, L2) reading. Experiment 1 consisted of L1 French-L2 English bilinguals reading in the L2, and Experiment 2 consisted of L1 English-L2 French bilinguals reading in the L1. Both groups read English sentences with target words serving as indices of cross-language activation: cross-language homographs, cognates, and matched language-unique control words. Critically, we manipulated whether English sentences contained a momentary language switch into French before downstream target words. This allowed us to assess the consequences of shifting language demands, both in the moment, and residually following a switch as a function of language experience. Switches into French were associated with a reading cost at the switch site for both L2 and L1 readers. However, downstream cross-language activation was larger following a switch only for L1 readers. These results suggest that cross-language activation is jointly sensitive to momentary shifts in language demands and language experience, likely reflecting different control demands faced by L2 versus L1 readers, consistent with models of bilingual processing that ascribe a primary role for language control.

1420,Validation of Two Short Personality Inventories Using Self-Descriptions in Natural Language and Quantitative Semantics Test Theory,"Background:
      
    

    
      If individual differences are relevant and prominent features of personality, then they are expected to be encoded in natural language, thus manifesting themselves in single words. Recently, the quantification of text data using advanced natural language processing techniques offers innovative opportunities to map people's own words and narratives to their responses to self-reports. Here, we demonstrate the usefulness of self-descriptions in natural language and what we tentatively call Quantitative Semantic Test Theory (QuSTT) to validate two short inventories that measure character traits. Method:
      
    

    
      In Study 1, participants (N 1 = 997) responded to the Short Character Inventory, which measures self-directedness, cooperativeness, and self-transcendence. In Study 2, participants (N 2 = 2373) responded to Short Dark Triad, which measures Machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy. In both studies, respondents were asked to generate 10 self-descriptive words. We used the Latent Semantic Algorithm to quantify the meaning of each trait using the participants' self-descriptive words. We then used these semantic representations to predict the self-reported scores. In a second set of analyses, we used word-frequency analyses to map the self-descriptive words to each of the participants' trait scores (i.e., one-dimensional analysis) and character profiles (i.e., three-dimensional analysis). Results:
      
    

    
      The semantic representation of each character trait was related to each corresponding self-reported score. However, participants' self-transcendence and Machiavellianism scores demonstrated similar relationships to all three semantic representations of the character traits in their respective personality model. The one-dimensional analyses showed that, for example, ""loving"" was indicative of both high cooperativeness and self-transcendence, while ""compassionate,"" ""kind,"" and ""caring"" was unique for individuals high in cooperativeness. The words ""kind"" and ""caring"" indicated low levels of Machiavellianism and psychopathy, whereas ""shy"" or ""introvert"" indicated low narcissism. We also found specific keywords that unify or that make the individuals in some profiles unique. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Despite being short, both inventories capture individuals' identity as expected. Nevertheless, our method also points out some shortcomings and overlaps between traits measured with these inventories. We suggest that self-descriptive words can be quantified to validate measures of psychological constructs (e.g., prevalence in self-descriptions or QuSTT) and that this method may complement traditional methods for testing the validity of psychological measures.","['1 Blekinge Center of Competence, Karlskrona, Sweden.', '2 Department of Psychology, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', '3 Department of Behavioral Science and Learning, Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden.', '4 Anthropedia Foundation, St. Louis, MO, United States.', '5 Department of Psychology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.']","Danilo Garcia, Patricia Rosenberg, Ali Al Nima, Alexandre Granjard, Kevin M Cloninger, Sverker Sikström, ",Frontiers in psychology,2020,character; identity; narrative self; personality; quantitative semantic test theory.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32140118

The objective of this research is to develop and test a novel tactic to solve the issue of translation from Roman Urdu to the English language. The approach used to construct this practical model is divided into three stages; each stage works out to achieve its desired task. Self-maintained corpus alongwith its corresponding tag-set is used for tokenization. The syntactical structure is covered by writing Urdu POS tagger based on grammatical rules. We prepared the grammatical structures of different sentences for Roman Urdu to English translation. Since Roman script can be expressed in numerous ways, our grammatical structures fulfill the maximum possible needs of writing and produce the best possible English translation. We entered a sentence in Roman Urdu which gave the best possible translation in the English language.

1422,Investigation of Machine Intelligence in Compound Cell Activity Classification,"Machine intelligence has been greatly developed in the past decades and has been widely used in many fields. In the recent years, many reports have shown its satisfactory effect in drug discovery. In this study, machine intelligence methods were explored to assist the cell activity prediction. Multiple machine intelligence methods including support vector machine, decision tree, random forest, extra trees, gradient boosting machine, convolutional neural network, long short-term memory network, and gated recurrent unit network were employed to separate compounds based on their cell activity. Different from some reported classification models, compounds were expressed as a string by the simplified molecular input line entry system and directly used as input rather than any chemical descriptors, which mimicked natural language processing. Both the single cell strain and whole data set under the balanced and imbalanced data distributions were discussed, respectively. Different activity cutoffs were set for the single (Z-score = 3) and the whole (Z-score = 5 and 6) data set. Nine metrics were used to evaluate the models including accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve score, Cohen's κ, Brier score, Matthews correlation coefficient, and balanced accuracy. The results show that the gradient boosting machine is competent at balanced data distribution, and convolutional neural network is qualified for the imbalanced one. The results demonstrate that both classic machine learning methods and deep learning methods have potential in classification of compound cell activity.","['1 Laboratory of Molecular Design and Drug Discovery, School of Science , China Pharmaceutical University , 639 Longmian Avenue , Nanjing 211198 , China.', '2 State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines , China Pharmaceutical University , 24 Tongjiaxiang , Nanjing 210009 , China.']","Yuanrong Fan, Yanmin Zhang, Yi Hua, Yuchen Wang, Lu Zhu, Junnan Zhao, Yan Yang, Xingye Chen, Shuai Lu, Tao Lu, Yadong Chen, Haichun Liu, ",Molecular pharmaceutics,2019,SMILES; convolutional neural network; deep learning; gradient boosting machine; machine learning.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31580683
1423,Sense identification data: A dataset for lexical semantics,"Sense Identification is a newly proposed task; in considering a pair of terms to assess their conceptual similarity, human raters are postulated to preliminarily select a sense pair. Senses involved in this pair are those actually subject to similarity rating. The sense identification task is searching for the sense selected during the similarity rating. The sense individuation task is important to investigate strategies and sense inventories underlying human lexical access and, moreover, it is a relevant complement to the semantic similarity task. Individuating which senses are involved in the similarity rating is also crucial in order to fully assess those ratings: if we have no idea of which two senses were retrieved, on which base can we assess the score expressing their semantic proximity? The Sense Identification Dataset (SID) dataset has been built to provide a common experimental ground to systems and approaches dealing with the sense identification task. It is the first dataset specifically designed for experimenting on the mentioned task. The SID dataset was created by manually annotating with sense identifiers the term pairs from an existing dataset, the SemEval-2017 Task 2 English dataset. The original dataset was originally conceived for experimenting on the semantic similarity task, and it contains a score expressing the human similarity rating for each term pair. For each such term pair we added a pair of annotated senses: in particular, senses were annotated such that they are compatible (explicative of) with the existing similarity ratings. The SID dataset contains BabelNet sense identifiers. This sense inventory is a broadly adopted 'naming convention' for word senses, and such identifiers can be easily mapped onto further resources such as WordNet and WikiData, thereby enabling further processing tasks and usages in the Natural Language Processing pipeline.","['1 Computer Science Department, University of Turin, Italy.']","Davide Colla, Enrico Mensa, Daniele P Radicioni, ",Data in brief,2020,Lexical processing; Lexical semantics; Semantic similarity; Sense annotation; Sense embeddings; Sense individuation; Similarity metrics; Word embeddings.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32984463

1425,Cross-language activation and executive control modulate within-language ambiguity resolution: Evidence from eye movements,"An important question within psycholinguistics is how knowledge of multiple languages impacts the coactivation of word forms and meanings during language comprehension. To the extent that a bilingual's known languages are always partially active, as predicted by models such as the bilingual interactive activation plus model (Dijkstra & Van Heuven, 2002), cross-language activation should influence which meanings are accessed and in which order. Here, we monitored the eye movements of 48 French-English and 40 English-French bilingual adults as they read within-language homonyms embedded in more or less semantically constraining English sentences. The within-language homonyms were either cognate homonyms, whose subordinate meanings were also French cognates (e.g., sage, ""herb"" or, less frequently, ""wise man"" in English and, also, ""wise man"" in French), or uniquely English (e.g., chest). French-English bilinguals processed cognate homonyms with subordinate meanings more quickly than uniquely English homonyms with subordinate meanings, and individual differences in executive control capacity modulated their processing of uniquely English homonyms only. In contrast, English-French bilinguals processed all within-language homonyms similarly, regardless of cognate status and executive control capacity. Our findings suggest that cross-language activation impacts within-language ambiguity resolution by changing the relative dominance of the meanings associated with a word form, and that cross-language activation varies as a function of the language tested (first or second language).

1426,Large Scale Semi-Automated Labeling of Routine Free-Text Clinical Records for Deep Learning,"Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer death among women in the USA. Screening mammography is effective in reducing mortality, but has a high rate of unnecessary recalls and biopsies. While deep learning can be applied to mammography, large-scale labeled datasets, which are difficult to obtain, are required. We aim to remove many barriers of dataset development by automatically harvesting data from existing clinical records using a hybrid framework combining traditional NLP and IBM Watson. An expert reviewer manually annotated 3521 breast pathology reports with one of four outcomes: left positive, right positive, bilateral positive, negative. Traditional NLP techniques using seven different machine learning classifiers were compared to IBM Watson's automated natural language classifier. Techniques were evaluated using precision, recall, and F-measure. Logistic regression outperformed all other traditional machine learning classifiers and was used for subsequent comparisons. Both traditional NLP and Watson's NLC performed well for cases under 1024 characters with weighted average F-measures above 0.96 across all classes. Performance of traditional NLP was lower for cases over 1024 characters with an F-measure of 0.83. We demonstrate a hybrid framework using traditional NLP techniques combined with IBM Watson to annotate over 10,000 breast pathology reports for development of a large-scale database to be used for deep learning in mammography. Our work shows that traditional NLP and IBM Watson perform extremely well for cases under 1024 characters and can accelerate the rate of data annotation.","['1 Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA. hari.trivedi@gmail.com.', '2 Institute for Computational Health Sciences, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.', '3 University of California School of Medicine, San Francisco, CA, USA.', '4 Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.', '5 Department of Pathology, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.']","Hari M Trivedi, Maryam Panahiazar, April Liang, Dmytro Lituiev, Peter Chang, Jae Ho Sohn, Yunn-Yi Chen, Benjamin L Franc, Bonnie Joe, Dexter Hadley, ",Journal of digital imaging,2019 Feb,Artificial intelligence; Deep learning; IBM Watson; Machine learning; Mammography; Natural language processing (NLP); Pathology.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30128778
1427,Enhancing timeliness of drug overdose mortality surveillance: A machine learning approach,"Background:
      
    

    
      Timely data is key to effective public health responses to epidemics. Drug overdose deaths are identified in surveillance systems through ICD-10 codes present on death certificates. ICD-10 coding takes time, but free-text information is available on death certificates prior to ICD-10 coding. The objective of this study was to develop a machine learning method to classify free-text death certificates as drug overdoses to provide faster drug overdose mortality surveillance. Methods:
      
    

    
      Using 2017-2018 Kentucky death certificate data, free-text fields were tokenized and features were created from these tokens using natural language processing (NLP). Word, bigram, and trigram features were created as well as features indicating the part-of-speech of each word. These features were then used to train machine learning classifiers on 2017 data. The resulting models were tested on 2018 Kentucky data and compared to a simple rule-based classification approach. Documented code for this method is available for reuse and extensions: https://github.com/pjward5656/dcnlp. Results:
      
    

    
      The top scoring machine learning model achieved 0.96 positive predictive value (PPV) and 0.98 sensitivity for an F-score of 0.97 in identification of fatal drug overdoses on test data. This machine learning model achieved significantly higher performance for sensitivity (p<0.001) than the rule-based approach. Additional feature engineering may improve the model's prediction. This model can be deployed on death certificates as soon as the free-text is available, eliminating the time needed to code the death certificates. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Machine learning using natural language processing is a relatively new approach in the context of surveillance of health conditions. This method presents an accessible application of machine learning that improves the timeliness of drug overdose mortality surveillance. As such, it can be employed to inform public health responses to the drug overdose epidemic in near-real time as opposed to several weeks following events.","['1 Kentucky Injury Prevention and Research Center, College of Public Health, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, United States of America.', '2 Department of Epidemiology, College of Public Health, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, United States of America.', '3 Department of Biostatistics, College of Public Health, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, United States of America.', '4 Center on Drug and Alcohol Research, College of Medicine, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, United States of America.', '5 Department of Preventive Medicine and Environmental Health, College of Public Health, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, United States of America.', '6 Department of Computer Science, College of Engineering, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, United States of America.', '7 Division of Biomedical Informatics, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, United States of America.']","Patrick J Ward, Peter J Rock, Svetla Slavova, April M Young, Terry L Bunn, Ramakanth Kavuluru, ",PloS one,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31618226
1428,Expectations about word stress modulate neural activity in speech-sensitive cortical areas,"A recent dual-stream model of language processing proposed that the postero-dorsal stream performs predictive sequential processing of linguistic information via hierarchically organized internal models. However, it remains unexplored whether the prosodic segmentation of linguistic information involves predictive processes. Here, we addressed this question by investigating the processing of word stress, a major component of speech segmentation, using probabilistic repetition suppression (RS) modulation as a marker of predictive processing. In an event-related acoustic fMRI RS paradigm, we presented pairs of pseudowords having the same (Rep) or different (Alt) stress patterns, in blocks with varying Rep and Alt trial probabilities. We found that the BOLD signal was significantly lower for Rep than for Alt trials, indicating RS in the posterior and middle superior temporal gyrus (STG) bilaterally, and in the anterior STG in the left hemisphere. Importantly, the magnitude of RS was modulated by repetition probability in the posterior and middle STG. These results reveal the predictive processing of word stress in the STG areas and raise the possibility that words stress processing is related to the dorsal ""where"" auditory stream.","['1 Brain Imaging Centre, Research Centre for Natural Sciences, Budapest, Hungary; Institute of Psychology, Eötvös Loránd University, Budapest, Hungary.

We developed and validated a rule-based computerized algorithm called PregHisEx to characterize past obstetrical history (preeclampsia/eclampsia) by mining prenatal clinical notes for women delivered in 2012 within a large healthcare maintenance organization.

1430,Using Language Representation Learning Approach to Efficiently Identify Protein Complex Categories in Electron Transport Chain,"We herein proposed a novel approach based on the language representation learning method to categorize electron complex proteins into 5 types. The idea is stemmed from the the shared characteristics of human language and protein sequence language, thus advanced natural language processing techniques were used for extracting useful features. Specifically, we employed transfer learning and word embedding techniques to analyze electron complex sequences and create efficient feature sets before using a support vector machine algorithm to classify them. During the 5-fold cross-validation processes, seven types of sequence-based features were analyzed to find the optimal features. On an average, our final classification models achieved the accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and MCC of 96 %, 96.1 %, 95.3 %, and 0.86, respectively on cross-validation data. For the independent test data, those corresponding performance scores are 95.3 %, 92.6 %, 94 %, and 0.87. We concluded that using feature extracted using these representation learning methods, the prediction performance of simple machine learning algorithm is on par with existing deep neural network method on the task of categorizing electron complexes while enjoying a much faster way for feature generation. Furthermore, the results also showed that the combination of features learned from the representation learning methods and sequence motif counts helps yield better performance.","['1 Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Yuan Ze University, Chung-Li, Taiwan, 32003.', '2 Professional Master Program in Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei City, 106, Taiwan.', '3 Research Center for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei City, 106, Taiwan.', '4 University of Economics, University of Danang, 41 Leduan St, Danang City, 550000, Vietnam.']","Trinh-Trung-Duong Nguyen, Nguyen-Quoc-Khanh Le, Quang-Thai Ho, Dinh-Van Phan, Yu-Yen Ou, ",Molecular informatics,2020,electron complexes; motif frequencies; protein function prediction; representation learning; transfer learning; word embeddings.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32598045

To further valid our approach, we also applied different machine learning algorithms on cohort using automatically generated keywords.

1432,Domain-general and domain-specific computations in single word processing,"Language comprehension relies on a multitude of domain-general and domain-specific cognitive operations. This study asks whether the domain-specific grammatical computations are obligatorily invoked whenever we process linguistic inputs. Using fMRI and three complementary measures of neural activity, we tested how domain-general and domain-specific demands of single word comprehension engage cortical language networks, and whether the left frontotemporal network (commonly taken to support domain-specific grammatical computations) automatically processes grammatical information present in inflectionally complex words. In a natural listening task, participants were presented with words that manipulated domain-general and domain-specific processing demands in a 2 × 2 manner. The results showed that only domain-general demands of mapping words onto their representations consistently engaged the language processing system during single word comprehension, triggering increased activity and connectivity in bilateral frontotemporal regions, as well as bilateral encoding across multivoxel activity patterns. In contrast, inflectional complexity failed to activate left frontotemporal regions in this task, implying that domain-specific grammatical processing in the left hemisphere is not automatically triggered when the processing context does not specifically require such analysis. This suggests that cortical computations invoked by language processing critically depend on the current communicative goals and demands, underlining the importance of domain-general processes in language comprehension, and arguing against the strong domain-specific view of the LH network function.","['1 Basque Center on Cognition, Brain and Language, Mikeletegi Pasealekua, 69, 20009, Donostia, Gipuzkoa, Spain.

      Although injured employees are legally covered by workers' compensation insurance in South Korea, some employers make agreements to prevent the injured employees from claiming their compensation. Thus, this leads to underreporting of occupational injury statistics. Illegal compensation (called gong-sang in Korean) is a critical method used to underreport or cover-up occupational injuries. However, gong-sang is not counted in the official occupational injury statistics; therefore, we cannot identify gong-sang-related issues. Objective:
      
    

    
      This study aimed to analyze social media data using topic modeling to explore hidden knowledge about illegal compensation-gong-sang-for occupational injury in South Korea. Methods:
      
    

    
      We collected 2210 documents from social media data by filtering the keyword, gong-sang. The study period was between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2017. After completing natural language processing of the Korean language, a morphological analyzer, we performed topic modeling using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) in the Python library, Gensim. A 10-topic model was selected and run with 3000 Gibbs sampling iterations to fit the model. Results:
      
    

    
      The LDA model was used to classify gong-sang-related documents into 4 categories from a total of 10 topics. Topic 1 was the greatest concern (60.5%). Workers who suffered from industrial accidents seemed to be worried about illegal compensation and legal insurance claims, wherein keywords on the choice between illegal compensation and legal insurance claims were included. In topic 2, keywords were associated with claims for industrial accident insurance benefits. Topics 3 and 4, as the second highest concern (19%), contained keywords implying the monetary compensation of gong-sang. Topics 5 to 10 included keywords on vulnerable jobs (ie, workers in the construction and defense industry, delivery riders, and foreign workers) and body parts (ie, injuries to the hands, face, teeth, lower limbs, and back) to gong-sang. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We explored hidden knowledge to identify the salient issues surrounding gong-sang using the LDA model. These topics may provide valuable information to ensure the more efficient operation of South Korea's occupational health and safety administration and protect vulnerable workers from illegal gong-sang compensation practices.","['1 Institute of Health and Environment, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', '2 Department of Preventive Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']","Jin-Young Min, Sung-Hee Song, HyeJin Kim, Kyoung-Bok Min, ",JMIR medical informatics,2019,Korea; occupational injuries; social media; worker’s compensation.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31573948
1434,UDSMProt: universal deep sequence models for protein classification,"Motivation:
      
    

    
      Inferring the properties of a protein from its amino acid sequence is one of the key problems in bioinformatics. Most state-of-the-art approaches for protein classification are tailored to single classification tasks and rely on handcrafted features, such as position-specific-scoring matrices from expensive database searches. We argue that this level of performance can be reached or even be surpassed by learning a task-agnostic representation once, using self-supervised language modeling, and transferring it to specific tasks by a simple fine-tuning step. Results:
      
    

    
      We put forward a universal deep sequence model that is pre-trained on unlabeled protein sequences from Swiss-Prot and fine-tuned on protein classification tasks. We apply it to three prototypical tasks, namely enzyme class prediction, gene ontology prediction and remote homology and fold detection. The proposed method performs on par with state-of-the-art algorithms that were tailored to these specific tasks or, for two out of three tasks, even outperforms them. These results stress the possibility of inferring protein properties from the sequence alone and, on more general grounds, the prospects of modern natural language processing methods in omics. Moreover, we illustrate the prospects for explainable machine learning methods in this field by selected case studies. Availability and implementation:

1435,A Deep Learning-Based Decision Support Tool for Precision Risk Assessment of Breast Cancer,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      The Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) lexicon was developed to standardize mammographic reporting to assess cancer risk and facilitate the decision to biopsy. Because of substantial interobserver variability in the application of the BI-RADS lexicon, the decision to biopsy varies greatly and results in overdiagnosis and excessive biopsies. The false-positive rate from mammograms is estimated to be 7% to approximately 10% overall, but within the BI-RADS 4 category, it is greater than 70%. Therefore, we developed the Breast Cancer Risk Calculator (BRISK) to target a well-characterized and specific patient subgroup (BI-RADS 4) rather than a broad heterogeneous group in assessing breast cancer risk. Methods:
      
    

    
      BRISK provides a novel precise risk assessment model to reduce overdiagnosis and unnecessary biopsies. It was developed by applying natural language processing and deep learning methods on 5,147 patient records archived in the Houston Methodist systemwide data warehouse from 2006 to May 2015, including imaging and pathology reports, mammographic images, and patient demographics. Key characteristics for BI-RADS 4 patients were collected and computed to output an index measure for biopsy recommendation that is clinically relevant and informative and improves upon the traditional BI-RADS 4 scores. Results:
      
    

    
      For the validation set, we assessed data from 1,247 BI-RADS 4 patients, including mammographic images and medical reports. The BRISK model sensitivity to predict malignancy was 100%, whereas the specificity was 74%. The total accuracy of our implemented model in BRISK was 81%. Overall area under the curve was 0.93.

1436,The Detection of Opioid Misuse and Heroin Use From Paramedic Response Documentation: Machine Learning for Improved Surveillance,"Background:
      
    

    
      Timely, precise, and localized surveillance of nonfatal events is needed to improve response and prevention of opioid-related problems in an evolving opioid crisis in the United States. Records of naloxone administration found in prehospital emergency medical services (EMS) data have helped estimate opioid overdose incidence, including nonhospital, field-treated cases. However, as naloxone is often used by EMS personnel in unconsciousness of unknown cause, attributing naloxone administration to opioid misuse and heroin use (OM) may misclassify events. Better methods are needed to identify OM. Objective:
      
    

    
      This study aimed to develop and test a natural language processing method that would improve identification of potential OM from paramedic documentation. Methods:
      
    

    
      First, we searched Denver Health paramedic trip reports from August 2017 to April 2018 for keywords naloxone, heroin, and both combined, and we reviewed narratives of identified reports to determine whether they constituted true cases of OM. Then, we used this human classification as reference standard and trained 4 machine learning models (random forest, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, and L1-regularized logistic regression). We selected the algorithm that produced the highest area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) for model assessment. Finally, we compared positive predictive value (PPV) of the highest performing machine learning algorithm with PPV of searches of keywords naloxone, heroin, and combination of both in the binary classification of OM in unseen September 2018 data. Results:
      
    

    
      In total, 54,359 trip reports were filed from August 2017 to April 2018. Approximately 1.09% (594/54,359) indicated naloxone administration. Among trip reports with reviewer agreement regarding OM in the narrative, 57.6% (292/516) were considered to include information revealing OM. Approximately 1.63% (884/54,359) of all trip reports mentioned heroin in the narrative. Among trip reports with reviewer agreement, 95.5% (784/821) were considered to include information revealing OM. Combined results accounted for 2.39% (1298/54,359) of trip reports. Among trip reports with reviewer agreement, 77.79% (907/1166) were considered to include information consistent with OM. The reference standard used to train and test machine learning models included details of 1166 trip reports. L1-regularized logistic regression was the highest performing algorithm (AUC=0.94; 95% CI 0.91-0.97) in identifying OM. Tested on 5983 unseen reports from September 2018, the keyword naloxone inaccurately identified and underestimated probable OM trip report cases (63 cases; PPV=0.68). The keyword heroin yielded more cases with improved performance (129 cases; PPV=0.99). Combined keyword and L1-regularized logistic regression classifier further improved performance (146 cases; PPV=0.99). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      A machine learning application enhanced the effectiveness of finding OM among documented paramedic field responses. This approach to refining OM surveillance may lead to improved first-responder and public health responses toward prevention of overdoses and other opioid-related problems in US communities.","['1 Division of Scientific Education and Professional Development, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, United States.', '2 Denver Public Health, Denver Health and Hospital Authority, Denver, CO, United States.', '3 Department of Epidemiology, Colorado School of Public Health, Aurora, CO, United States.', '4 Denver Health Paramedics, Denver Health and Hospital Authority, Denver, CO, United States.', '5 Department of Family Medicine, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, United States.', '6 Department of Biostatistics and Informatics, Colorado School of Public Health, Aurora, CO, United States.']","José Tomás Prieto, Kenneth Scott, Dean McEwen, Laura J Podewils, Alia Al-Tayyib, James Robinson, David Edwards, Seth Foldy, Judith C Shlay, Arthur J Davidson, ",Journal of medical Internet research,2020,artificial intelligence; emergency medical services; heroin; naloxone; natural language processing; opioid crisis; substance-related disorders.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31899451
1437,Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Cardiovascular Health Care,"Background:
      
    

    
      This review article provides an overview of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) as it relates to cardiovascular health care. Methods:
      
    

    
      An overview of the terminology and algorithms used in ML as it relates to health care are provided by the author. Articles published up to August 1, 2019, in the field of AI and ML in cardiovascular medicine are also reviewed and placed in the context of the potential role these approaches will have in clinical practice in the future. Results:
      
    

    
      AI is a broader term referring to the ability of machines to perform intelligent tasks, and ML is a subset of AI that refers to the ability of machines to learn independently and make accurate predictions. An expanding body of literature has been published using ML in cardiovascular health care. Moreover, ML has been applied in the settings of automated imaging interpretation, natural language processing and data extraction from electronic health records, and predictive analytics. Examples include automated interpretation of chest roentgenograms, electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, and angiography; identification of patients with early heart failure using clinical notes evaluated by ML; and predicting mortality or complications following percutaneous or surgical cardiovascular procedures. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Although there is an expanding body of literature on AI and ML in cardiovascular medicine, the future these fields will have in clinical practice remains to be paved. In particular, there is a promising role in providing automated imaging interpretation, automated data extraction and quality control, and clinical risk prediction, although these techniques require further refinement and evaluation.","['1 Division of Cardiac Surgery, Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

1438,Attention in Natural Language Processing,"Attention is an increasingly popular mechanism used in a wide range of neural architectures. The mechanism itself has been realized in a variety of formats. However, because of the fast-paced advances in this domain, a systematic overview of attention is still missing. In this article, we define a unified model for attention architectures in natural language processing, with a focus on those designed to work with vector representations of the textual data. We propose a taxonomy of attention models according to four dimensions: the representation of the input, the compatibility function, the distribution function, and the multiplicity of the input and/or output. We present the examples of how prior information can be exploited in attention models and discuss ongoing research efforts and open challenges in the area, providing the first extensive categorization of the vast body of literature in this exciting domain.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Andrea Galassi, Marco Lippi, Paolo Torroni, ",IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32915750
1439,Applications of Artificial Intelligence to Electronic Health Record Data in Ophthalmology,"Widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has resulted in the collection of massive amounts of clinical data. In ophthalmology in particular, the volume range of data captured in EHR systems has been growing rapidly. Yet making effective secondary use of this EHR data for improving patient care and facilitating clinical decision-making has remained challenging due to the complexity and heterogeneity of these data. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques present a promising way to analyze these multimodal data sets. While AI techniques have been extensively applied to imaging data, there are a limited number of studies employing AI techniques with clinical data from the EHR. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of different AI methods applied to EHR data in the field of ophthalmology. This literature review highlights that the secondary use of EHR data has focused on glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and cataracts with the use of AI techniques. These techniques have been used to improve ocular disease diagnosis, risk assessment, and progression prediction. Techniques such as supervised machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing were most commonly used in the articles reviewed.","['1 Department of Medical Informatics and Clinical Epidemiology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', '2 School of Medicine, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', '3 Department of Ophthalmology, Casey Eye Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA.']","Wei-Chun Lin, Jimmy S Chen, Michael F Chiang, Michelle R Hribar, ",Translational vision science & technology,2020,artificial intelligence; electronic health record; machine learning; ophthalmology.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32704419
1440,Phase synchronization varies systematically with linguistic structure composition,"Computation in neuronal assemblies is putatively reflected in the excitatory and inhibitory cycles of activation distributed throughout the brain. In speech and language processing, coordination of these cycles resulting in phase synchronization has been argued to reflect the integration of information on different timescales (e.g. segmenting acoustics signals to phonemic and syllabic representations; (Giraud and Poeppel 2012 Nat. Neurosci. 15, 511 (doi:10.1038/nn.3063)). A natural extension of this claim is that phase synchronization functions similarly to support the inference of more abstract higher-level linguistic structures (Martin 2016 Front. Psychol. 7, 120; Martin and Doumas 2017 PLoS Biol. 15, e2000663 (doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.2000663); Martin and Doumas. 2019 Curr. Opin. Behav. Sci. 29, 77-83 (doi:10.1016/j.cobeha.2019.04.008)). Hale et al. (Hale et al. 2018 Finding syntax in human encephalography with beam search. arXiv 1806.04127 (http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.04127)) showed that syntactically driven parsing decisions predict electroencephalography (EEG) responses in the time domain; here we ask whether phase synchronization in the form of either inter-trial phrase coherence or cross-frequency coupling (CFC) between high-frequency (i.e. gamma) bursts and lower-frequency carrier signals (i.e. delta, theta), changes as the linguistic structures of compositional meaning (viz., bracket completions, as denoted by the onset of words that complete phrases) accrue. We use a naturalistic story-listening EEG dataset from Hale et al. to assess the relationship between linguistic structure and phase alignment. We observe increased phase synchronization as a function of phrase counts in the delta, theta, and gamma bands, especially for function words. A more complex pattern emerged for CFC as phrase count changed, possibly related to the lack of a one-to-one mapping between 'size' of linguistic structure and frequency band-an assumption that is tacit in recent frameworks. These results emphasize the important role that phase synchronization, desynchronization, and thus, inhibition, play in the construction of compositional meaning by distributed neural networks in the brain. This article is part of the theme issue 'Towards mechanistic models of meaning composition'.","['1 Department of Linguistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', '2 Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Wundtlaan 1, 6525 XD Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', '3 Donders Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behavior, Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']","Jonathan R Brennan, Andrea E Martin, ","Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

1441,Using the DRM paradigm to assess language processing in monolinguals and bilinguals,"Both languages are jointly activated in the bilingual brain, requiring bilinguals to select the target language while avoiding interference from the unwanted language. This cross-language interference is similar to the within-language interference created by the Deese-Roediger-McDermott false memory paradigm (DRM; Roediger & McDermott, 1995, Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 21[4], 803-814). Although the mechanisms mediating false memory in the DRM paradigm remain an area of investigation, two of the more prominent theories-implicit associative response (IAR) and fuzzy trace-provide frameworks for using the DRM paradigm to advance our understanding of bilingual language processing. Three studies are reported comparing accuracy of monolingual and bilingual participants on different versions of the DRM. Study 1 presented lists of phonological associates and found that bilinguals showed higher rates of false recognition than did monolinguals. Study 2 used the standard semantic variant of the task and found that bilinguals showed lower false recognition rates than did monolinguals. Study 3 replicated and extended the findings in Experiment 2 in another semantic version of the task presented to younger and older adult monolingual and bilingual participants. These results are discussed within the frameworks of IAR and fuzzy-trace theories as further explicating differences between monolingual and bilingual processing.","['1 Department of Psychology, York University, 4700 Keele St., Toronto, ON, M3J 1P3, Canada. ellenb@yorku.ca.', '2 Center for Vital Longevity, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA.', '3 Department of Psychology, Ryerson University, Toronto, ON, Canada.', '4 Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, USA.']","Ellen Bialystok, Avanti Dey, Margot D Sullivan, Mitchell S Sommers, ",Memory & cognition,2020 Jul,Aging; Bilingualism; False memory; Phonology; Selective attention; Semantics.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31975029
1442,Speech recognition for clinical documentation from 1990 to 2018: a systematic review,"Objective:
      
    

    
      The study sought to review recent literature regarding use of speech recognition (SR) technology for clinical documentation and to understand the impact of SR on document accuracy, provider efficiency, institutional cost, and more. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      We searched 10 scientific and medical literature databases to find articles about clinician use of SR for documentation published between January 1, 1990, and October 15, 2018. We annotated included articles with their research topic(s), medical domain(s), and SR system(s) evaluated and analyzed the results. Results:
      
    

    
      One hundred twenty-two articles were included. Forty-eight (39.3%) involved the radiology department exclusively and 10 (8.2%) involved emergency medicine; 10 (8.2%) mentioned multiple departments. Forty-eight (39.3%) articles studied productivity; 20 (16.4%) studied the effect of SR on documentation time, with mixed findings. Decreased turnaround time was reported in all 19 (15.6%) studies in which it was evaluated. Twenty-nine (23.8%) studies conducted error analyses, though various evaluation metrics were used. Reported percentage of documents with errors ranged from 4.8% to 71%; reported word error rates ranged from 7.4% to 38.7%. Seven (5.7%) studies assessed documentation-associated costs; 5 reported decreases and 2 reported increases. Many studies (44.3%) used products by Nuance Communications. Other vendors included IBM (9.0%) and Philips (6.6%); 7 (5.7%) used self-developed systems. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Despite widespread use of SR for clinical documentation, research on this topic remains largely heterogeneous, often using different evaluation metrics with mixed findings. Further, that SR-assisted documentation has become increasingly common in clinical settings beyond radiology warrants further investigation of its use and effectiveness in these settings.","['1 Clinical and Quality Analysis, Information Systems, Partners HealthCare, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', ""2 General Medicine and Primary Care, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."", '3 Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']","Suzanne V Blackley, Jessica Huynh, Liqin Wang, Zfania Korach, Li Zhou, ",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2019,clinical document quality; clinical documentation; dictation; natural language processing; speech recognition software.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30753666
1443,"The role of public challenges and data sets towards algorithm development, trust, and use in clinical practice","In the past decade, machine learning and artificial intelligence have made significant advancements in pattern analysis, including speech and natural language processing, image recognition, object detection, facial recognition, and action categorization. Indeed, in many of these applications, accuracy has reached or exceeded human levels of performance. Subsequently, a multitude of studies have begun to examine the application of these technologies to health care, and in particular, medical image analysis. Perhaps the most difficult subdomain involves skin imaging because of the lack of standards around imaging hardware, technique, color, and lighting conditions. In addition, unlike radiological images, skin image appearance can be significantly affected by skin tone as well as the broad range of diseases. Furthermore, automated algorithm development relies on large high-quality annotated image data sets that incorporate the breadth of this circumstantial and diagnostic variety. These issues, in combination with unique complexities regarding integrating artificial intelligence systems into a clinical workflow, have led to difficulty in using these systems to improve sensitivity and specificity of skin diagnostics in health care networks around the world. In this article, we summarize recent advancements in machine learning, with a focused perspective on the role of public challenges and data sets on the progression of these technologies in skin imaging. In addition, we highlight the remaining hurdles toward effective implementation of technologies to the clinical workflow and discuss how public challenges and data sets can catalyze the development of solutions.","['1 Dermatology Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', '2 IBM Research AI, T.J.

1444,Coloring Book: A new method for testing language comprehension,"We present a new method for investigating children's language comprehension and argue that it has the potential to mitigate known task-related biases and expose children's grammatical and lexical knowledge in a more natural and ecologically valid manner. The new method consists of filling in a digital coloring page, according to sentence stimuli (e.g., The green monkey is being scratched by the blue monkey; The rabbit is red.). Through the playful act of coloring in the page, children reveal their interpretations of grammatical constructions and lexical items. We argue that this method gives more accurate results than existing methods, in which children are asked to choose among several pictures representing a number of possible interpretations. We present two experimental studies: one with Dutch-speaking children, tested on four types of grammatical constructions, and a second study with children learning Dutch as a second language, tested on their vocabulary knowledge. In both studies, the new method was compared with one of the most widely used methods: the picture selection task. In the first study where children's performance is said to be underestimated, the new method reveals better performance whereas in the second study where children's performance is assumed to be overestimated, the new method reveals lower performance. The results suggest therefore that the new task indeed decreases external task-related effects and offers a more reliable measurement of children's linguistic knowledge.","['1 Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands. m.pinto@uu.nl.', '2 Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']","Manuela Pinto, Shalom Zuckerman, ",Behavior research methods,2019 Dec,Ecological validity; Grammatical development; Language comprehension; Processing; Task-related effects; Vocabulary assessment.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30187431

In fact, data re-analysis can either answer novel questions or provide critical data able to complement in-house experiments. However, despite the development of standards for the compilation of metadata, the identification and organization of samples still constitutes a major bottleneck hampering data reuse. We introduce Onassis, an R package within the Bioconductor environment providing key functionalities of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools. Leveraging biomedical ontologies, Onassis greatly simplifies the association of samples from large-scale repositories to their representation in terms of ontology-based annotations. Moreover, through the use of semantic similarity measures, Onassis hierarchically organizes the datasets of interest, thus supporting the semantically aware analysis of the corresponding omics data. In conclusion, Onassis leverages NLP techniques, biomedical ontologies, and the R statistical framework, to identify, relate, and analyze datasets from public repositories. The tool was tested on various large-scale datasets, including compendia of gene expression, histone marks, and DNA methylation, illustrating how it can facilitate the integrative analysis of various omics data.","['1 Center for Genomic Science of IIT@SEMM, Fondazione Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Milano, Italy.', '2 Center for Genomic Science of IIT@SEMM, Fondazione Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Milano, Italy. mattia.pelizzola@iit.it.']","Eugenia Galeota, Kamal Kishore, Mattia Pelizzola, ",Scientific reports,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31959844
1446,Multimodal 18 F-AV-1451 and MRI Findings in Nonfluent Variant of Primary Progressive Aphasia: Possible Insights on Nodal Propagation of Tau Protein Across the Syntactic Network,"Although abnormally folded tau protein has been found to self-propagate from neuron to connected neuron, similar propagation through human brain networks has not been fully documented. We studied tau propagation in the left hemispheric syntactic network, which comprises an anterior frontal node and a posterior temporal node connected by the white matter of the left arcuate fasciculus. This network is affected in the nonfluent variant of primary progressive aphasia, a neurodegenerative disorder with tau accumulation. Methods: Eight patients with the nonfluent variant of primary progressive aphasia (age, 67.0 ± 7.4 y; 4 women) and 8 healthy controls (age, 69.6 ± 7.0 y; 4 women) were scanned with 18F-AV-1451 tau PET to determine tau deposition in the brain and with MRI to determine the fractional anisotropy of the arcuate fasciculus. Normal syntactic network characteristics were confirmed with structural MRI diffusion imaging in our healthy controls and with blood oxygenation level-dependent functional imaging in 35 healthy participants from the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. Results: Language scores in patients indicated dysfunction of the anterior node. 18F-AV-1451 deposition was greatest in the 2 nodes of the syntactic network. The left arcuate fasciculus had decreased fractional anisotropy, particularly near the anterior node. Normal MRI structural connectivity from an area similar to the one containing tau in the anterior frontal node projected to an area similar to the one containing tau in the patients in the posterior temporal node. Conclusion: Tau accumulation likely started in the more affected anterior node and, at the disease stage at which we studied these patients, appeared as well in the brain region (in the temporal lobe) spatially separate from but most connected with it. The arcuate fasciculus, connecting both of them, was most severely affected anteriorly, as would correspond to a loss of axons from the anterior node. These findings are suggestive of tau propagation from node to connected node in a natural human brain network and support the idea that neurons that wire together die together.","['1 Nantz National Alzheimer Center, Stanley H.

1447,The moment-to-moment pitch dynamics of child-directed speech shape toddlers' attention and learning,"Young children have an overall preference for child-directed speech (CDS) over adult-directed speech (ADS), and its structural features are thought to facilitate language learning. Many studies have supported these findings, but less is known about processing of CDS at short, sub-second timescales. How do the moment-to-moment dynamics of CDS influence young children's attention and learning? In Study 1, we used hierarchical clustering to characterize patterns of pitch variability in a natural CDS corpus, which uncovered four main word-level contour shapes: 'fall', 'rise', 'hill', and 'valley'. In Study 2, we adapted a measure from adult attention research-pupil size synchrony-to quantify real-time attention to speech across participants, and found that toddlers showed higher synchrony to the dynamics of CDS than to ADS. Importantly, there were consistent differences in toddlers' attention when listening to the four word-level contour types. In Study 3, we found that pupil size synchrony during exposure to novel words predicted toddlers' learning at test. This suggests that the dynamics of pitch in CDS not only shape toddlers' attention but guide their learning of new words. By revealing a physiological response to the real-time dynamics of CDS, this investigation yields a new sub-second framework for understanding young children's engagement with one of the most important signals in their environment.","['1 Department of Psychology, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA.', '2 Princeton Neuroscience Institute, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA.']","Mira L Nencheva, Elise A Piazza, Casey Lew-Williams, ",Developmental science,2020,attention; child-directed speech; learning; pitch; pupillometry; synchrony.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32441385
1448,Automatic Detection of Negated Findings in Radiological Reports for Spanish Language: Methodology Based on Lexicon-Grammatical Information Processing,"We present a methodology for the automatic recognition of negated findings in radiological reports considering morphological, syntactic, and semantic information. In order to achieve this goal, a series of rules for processing lexical and syntactic information was elaborated. This required development of an electronic dictionary of medical terminology and informatics grammars. Pertinent information for the assembly of the specialized dictionary was extracted from the ontology SNOMED CT and a medical dictionary (RANM, 2012). Likewise, a general language dictionary was also included. Lexicon-Grammar (LG), proposed by Gross (1975; Cahiers de l'institut de linguistique de Louvain, 24. 23-41 1998), was used to set up the database, which allowed an exhaustive description of the argument structure of predicates projected by lexical units. Computational framework was carried out with NooJ, a free software developed by Silberztein (Silberztein and Noo 2018, 2016), which has various utilities for treating natural language, such as morphological and syntactic grammar, as well as dictionaries. This methodology was compared with a Spanish version of NegEx (Chapman et al. Journal of Biomedical Informatics, 34(5):301-310 2001; Stricker 2016). Results show that there are minimal differences in favor of the algorithm developed using NooJ, but the quality and specificity of the data improves if lexical-grammatical information is added.","['1 Instituto de Literatura y Ciencias del Lenguaje, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso, Proyecto FONDECyT 1171033, Valparaíso, Chile. walter.koza@pucv.cl.', '2 Hospital Pediátrico Garrahan, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', '3 Departamento de Ciencias de la Computación, FCEyN, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', '4 Instituto de Literatura y Ciencias del Lenguaje, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso, Proyecto FONDECyT 1171033, Valparaíso, Chile.', '5 Universidad Diego Portales, Santiago, Chile.']","Walter Koza, Darío Filippo, Viviana Cotik, Vanesa Stricker, Mirian Muñoz, Ninoska Godoy, Natalia Rivas, Ricardo Martínez-Gamboa, ",Journal of digital imaging,2019 Feb,Automatic recognition; Lexicon-grammar; NegEx; Negated findings; NooJ.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30097747
1449,Online Processing of Subject-Verb-Object Order in a Diverse Sample of Mandarin-Exposed Preschool Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder,"Grammatical comprehension remains a strength in English-exposed young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), yet limited research has investigated how preschool children with ASD process grammatical structures in real time, in any language. Using the eye-movement measures of Intermodal Preferential Looking, we assessed online processing of subject-verb-object (SVO) order in seventy 2- to 5-year-old children with ASD exposed to Mandarin Chinese across the spectrum, whose vocabulary production scores were dramatically delayed compared with the typical controls. With this Mandarin-exposed sample, we tested the extent to which children with ASD require (a) highly consistent input and/or (b) good discourse/pragmatics for acquiring grammatical structures. Children viewed side-by-side videos depicting reversible actions (e.g., a bird pushing a horse vs. a horse pushing a bird), and heard an audio matching only one of those actions; their eyegaze to each video was coded and analyzed. Both typically developing children and children with ASD demonstrated comprehension of SVO word order, suggesting that core grammatical structures such as basic word order may be preserved in children with ASD across languages despite radical differences in language environment, social/pragmatic abilities, and neurological organization. However, children with ASD were less efficient in online sentence processing than typical children, and the efficiency of their online sentence processing was related to their standardized language assessment scores. Of note is that across both Mandarin Chinese and English, some proportion of minimally verbal children with ASD exhibited SVO comprehension despite their profoundly impaired expressive language skills. Autism Res 2019, 12: 1829-1844. © 2019 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: Grammar is a strength in the language comprehension of young English learners with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Eye-movement data from a diverse sample of Chinese preschoolers with ASD indicated similar grammatical strength of basic word order in Chinese (e.g., to understand sentences like ""The bird is pushing the horse""). Moreover, children's proficiency of sentence processing was related to their language assessment scores. Across languages, such knowledge is even spared in some minimally verbal children with ASD.","['1 Child Language Lab, School of Foreign Languages, Central South University, Changsha, China.', '2 Department of Psychological Sciences, University of Connecticut, Mansfield, Connecticut.']","Yi Esther Su, Letitia R Naigles, ",Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research,2019 Dec,Mandarin Chinese; grammar; online sentence processing; preschoolers; word order.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31402597
1450,Keyword extraction and structuralization of medical reports,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      In recent years, patients usually accept more accurate and detailed examinations because of the rapid advances in medical technology. Many of the examination reports are not represented in numerical data, but text documents written by the medical examiners based on the observations from the instruments and biochemical tests. If the above-mentioned unstructured data can be organized as a report in a structured form, it will help doctors to understand a patient's status of the various examinations more efficiently. Besides, further association analysis on the structuralized data can be performed to identify potential factors that affect a disease. Methods:
      
    

    
      In this paper, from the pathology examination reports of renal diseases, we applied the POS tagging results of natural language analysis to automatically extract the keyword phrases. Then a medical dictionary for various examination items in an examination report is established, which is used as the basic information for retrieving the terms to construct a structured form of the report. Moreover, a topical probability modeling method is applied to automatically discover the candidate keyword phrases of the examination items from the reports. Finally, a system is implemented to generate the structured form for the various examination items in a report according to the constructed medical dictionary. Results and conclusion:
      
    

    
      The results of the experiments showed that the methods proposed in this paper can effectively construct a structural form of examination reports. Furthermore, the keywords of the popular examination items can be extracted correctly. The above techniques will help automatic processing and analysis of medical text reports.","['1 1Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan Normal University, Taipei, Taiwan.', '2 2Big Data Center and Nephrology Division, China Medical University Hospital and College of Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', '3 3Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Asia University, Taichung, Taiwan.']","Pei-Hao Wu, Avon Yu, Ching-Wei Tsai, Jia-Ling Koh, Chin-Chi Kuo, Arbee L P Chen, ",Health information science and systems,2020,Extraction; Medical dictionary construction; Structuralization of medical report.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32269770
1451,Highly accurate classification of chest radiographic reports using a deep learning natural language model pretrained on 3.8 million text reports,"Motivation:
      
    

    
      The development of deep, bidirectional transformers such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) led to an outperformance of several Natural Language Processing (NLP) benchmarks. Especially in radiology, large amounts of free-text data are generated in the daily clinical workflow. These report texts could be of particular use for the generation of labels in machine learning, especially for image classification. However, as report text are mostly unstructured, advanced NLP methods are needed for text classification. While neural networks can be used for this purpose, they must first be trained on large amounts of manually labelled data in order to achieve good results. In contrast, BERT models can be pre-trained on unlabelledunlabeled data and then only require fine tuning on a small amount of manually labelled data to achieve even better results. Results:
      
    

    
      By using BERT to identify the most important findings in intensive care chest x-ray reports, we achieve areas under the receiver operation characteristics curve of 0.98 for congestion, 0.97 for effusion, 0.97 for consolidation and 0.99 for pneumothorax, surpassing the accuracy of previous approaches with comparatively little annotation effort. Our approach could help to improve information extraction from free-text medical reports.","['1 Department of Radiology, Charité, Hindenburgdamm 30, Berlin, Germany.', '2 Department of Oral- and Maxillofacial Surgery, Charité, Hindenburgdamm 30, Berlin.']","Keno K Bressem, Lisa C Adams, Robert A Gaudin, Daniel Tröltzsch, Bernd Hamm, Marcus R Makowski, Chan-Yong Schüle, Janis L Vahldiek, Stefan M Niehues, ","Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32702106
1452,A frame semantic overview of NLP-based information extraction for cancer-related EHR notes,"Objective:
      
    

    
      There is a lot of information about cancer in Electronic Health Record (EHR) notes that can be useful for biomedical research provided natural language processing (NLP) methods are available to extract and structure this information. In this paper, we present a scoping review of existing clinical NLP literature for cancer. Methods:
      
    

    
      We identified studies describing an NLP method to extract specific cancer-related information from EHR sources from PubMed, Google Scholar, ACL Anthology, and existing reviews. Two exclusion criteria were used in this study. We excluded articles where the extraction techniques used were too broad to be represented as frames (e.g., document classification) and also where very low-level extraction methods were used (e.g. simply identifying clinical concepts). 78 articles were included in the final review. We organized this information according to frame semantic principles to help identify common areas of overlap and potential gaps. Results:
      
    

    
      Frames were created from the reviewed articles pertaining to cancer information such as cancer diagnosis, tumor description, cancer procedure, breast cancer diagnosis, prostate cancer diagnosis and pain in prostate cancer patients. These frames included both a definition as well as specific frame elements (i.e. extractable attributes). We found that cancer diagnosis was the most common frame among the reviewed papers (36 out of 78), with recent work focusing on extracting information related to treatment and breast cancer diagnosis. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The list of common frames described in this paper identifies important cancer-related information extracted by existing NLP techniques and serves as a useful resource for future researchers requiring cancer information extracted from EHR notes. We also argue, due to the heavy duplication of cancer NLP systems, that a general purpose resource of annotated cancer frames and corresponding NLP tools would be valuable.","['1 School of Biomedical Informatics, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, TX, USA.', '2 School of Biomedical Informatics, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, TX, USA; Department of Internal Medicine, McGovern Medical School, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, TX, USA.', '3 School of Biomedical Informatics, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, TX, USA.

Data normalization is a key challenge for the secondary use of EHRs for COVID-19 research across institutions. In this study, we addressed the challenge of automating the normalization of COVID-19 diagnostic tests, which are critical data elements, but for which controlled terminology terms were published after clinical implementation. We developed a simple but effective rule-based tool called COVID-19 TestNorm to automatically normalize local COVID-19 testing names to standard LOINC (Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes) codes. COVID-19 TestNorm was developed and evaluated using 568 test names collected from 8 healthcare systems. Our results show that it could achieve an accuracy of 97.4% on an independent test set. COVID-19 TestNorm is available as an open-source package for developers and as an online Web application for end users (https://clamp.uth.edu/covid/loinc.php). We believe that it will be a useful tool to support secondary use of EHRs for research on COVID-19.","['1 School of Biomedical Informatics, University of Texas, Houston, Texas, USA.', '2 Department of Health Outcomes and Biomedical Informatics, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.', '3 VA Informatics and Computing Infrastructure, Veterans Affairs Salt Lake City Health Care System, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.', '4 Department of Internal Medicine Division of Epidemiology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.', '5 Tennessee Valley Healthcare System, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', '6 Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', '7 Division of Digital Health Sciences, Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', '8 Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA.', '9 Medical Informatics Services, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York, USA.', '10 Department of Biomedical Informatics, UCSD Health, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA.', '11 Division of Health Services Research and Development, Veterans Administration San Diego Healthcare System, La Jolla, California, USA.', '12 Department of Pharmaceutical Care and Health Systems, College of Pharmacy, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', '13 Division of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA.', '14 LOINC and Health Data Standards, Regenstrief Institute, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.']","Xiao Dong, Jianfu Li, Ekin Soysal, Jiang Bian, Scott L DuVall, Elizabeth Hanchrow, Hongfang Liu, Kristine E Lynch, Michael Matheny, Karthik Natarajan, Lucila Ohno-Machado, Serguei Pakhomov, Ruth Madeleine Reeves, Amy M Sitapati, Swapna Abhyankar, Theresa Cullen, Jami Deckard, Xiaoqian Jiang, Robert Murphy, Hua Xu, ",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2020,COVID-19; COVID-19 TestNorm; LOINC; natural language processing; testing name normalization.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32569358

1455,Chest Radiograph Interpretation with Deep Learning Models: Assessment with Radiologist-adjudicated Reference Standards and Population-adjusted Evaluation,"BackgroundDeep learning has the potential to augment the use of chest radiography in clinical radiology, but challenges include poor generalizability, spectrum bias, and difficulty comparing across studies.PurposeTo develop and evaluate deep learning models for chest radiograph interpretation by using radiologist-adjudicated reference standards.Materials and MethodsDeep learning models were developed to detect four findings (pneumothorax, opacity, nodule or mass, and fracture) on frontal chest radiographs. This retrospective study used two data sets. Data set 1 (DS1) consisted of 759 611 images from a multicity hospital network and ChestX-ray14 is a publicly available data set with 112 120 images. Natural language processing and expert review of a subset of images provided labels for 657 954 training images. Test sets consisted of 1818 and 1962 images from DS1 and ChestX-ray14, respectively. Reference standards were defined by radiologist-adjudicated image review. Performance was evaluated by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value. Four radiologists reviewed test set images for performance comparison. Inverse probability weighting was applied to DS1 to account for positive radiograph enrichment and estimate population-level performance.ResultsIn DS1, population-adjusted areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for pneumothorax, nodule or mass, airspace opacity, and fracture were, respectively, 0.95 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.91, 0.99), 0.72 (95% CI: 0.66, 0.77), 0.91 (95% CI: 0.88, 0.93), and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.79, 0.92). With ChestX-ray14, areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were 0.94 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.96), 0.91 (95% CI: 0.89, 0.93), 0.94 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.95), and 0.81 (95% CI: 0.75, 0.86), respectively.ConclusionExpert-level models for detecting clinically relevant chest radiograph findings were developed for this study by using adjudicated reference standards and with population-level performance estimation.

      The secondary use of medical data contained in electronic medical records, such as hospital discharge letters, is a valuable resource for the improvement of clinical care (e.g. in terms of medication safety) or for research purposes. However, the automated processing and analysis of medical free text still poses a huge challenge to available natural language processing (NLP) systems. The aim of this study was to implement a knowledge-based best of breed approach, combining a terminology server with integrated ontology, a NLP pipeline and a rules engine. Methods:
      
    

    
      We tested the performance of this approach in a use case. The clinical event of interest was the particular drug-disease interaction ""proton-pump inhibitor [PPI] use and osteoporosis"". Cases were to be identified based on free text digital discharge letters as source of information. Automated detection was validated against a gold standard. Results:
      
    

    
      Precision of recognition of osteoporosis was 94.19%, and recall was 97.45%. PPIs were detected with 100% precision and 97.97% recall. The F-score for the detection of the given drug-disease-interaction was 96,13%. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      We could show that our approach of combining a NLP pipeline, a terminology server, and a rules engine for the purpose of automated detection of clinical events such as drug-disease interactions from free text digital hospital discharge letters was effective. There is huge potential for the implementation in clinical and research contexts, as this approach enables analyses of very high numbers of medical free text documents within a short time period.","['1 Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Corporate Member of Freie Universität Berlin, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute of Health, Lipid Clinic at Interdisciplinary Metabolism Center, Berlin, Germany.', '2 Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Corporate Member of Freie Universität Berlin, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute of Health, Department of Nephrology and Internal Intensive Care Medicine Berlin, Germany.', '3 ID Information und Dokumentation im Gesundheitswesen GmbH, Berlin, Germany.', '4 Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, BCRT-Berlin Institute of Health Center for Regenerative Therapies, Berlin, Germany.']","Maximilian König, André Sander, Ilja Demuth, Daniel Diekmann, Elisabeth Steinhagen-Thiessen, ",PloS one,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31774830

      Incidentally discovered silent brain infarcts (id-SBIs) are an understudied condition with probable clinical significance, but it is not known how patients respond to or prioritize this condition. We sought to assess reporting of id-SBIs and how patients approach their diagnosis. Methods:
      
    

    
      Patients with id-SBIs were identified from sequential scans between 12/2015-5/2016, were referred by treating clinicians, or self-referred for the study. This study used qualitative semi-structured interviews. Purposeful sampling was used to achieve diversity in acuity, setting, and recruitment strategy. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. A constant comparative method was used to develop a coding schema, find consensus, and iteratively explore emergent themes until thematic saturation was achieved. Results:
      
    

    
      Only 10 of 102 patients prospectively identified by neuroimaging were informed of the imaging findings. Twelve participants in total were interviewed. Among the study participants, the primary themes were cognitive, emotional, and behavioral responses to diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic uncertainty regarding id-SBIs. Clinicians described id-SBIs to participants as an ambiguous condition. Participants feared potential consequences of id-SBIs, including symptomatic stroke, dementia, and disability. Participants attempted to reduce uncertainty with strategies including equating id-SBIs with symptomatic stroke, self-education about stroke, and seeking second opinions. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Participants considered id-SBIs to be a serious medical condition. Ambiguous counseling by clinicians on id-SBIs provoked or failed to attenuate fear, leading to participants adopting strategies aimed at reducing uncertainty.","['1 Department of Neurology, Tufts Medical Center, 800 Washington Street, Box 314, Boston, MA, 02111, USA. lester.y.leung.md@gmail.com.', '2 Center for Outcomes Research & Evaluation, Maine Medical Center Research Institute, Portland, USA.', '3 Predictive Analytics and Comparative Effectiveness Center, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, USA.', '4 Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, USA.', '5 Department of Neurology, Tufts Medical Center, 800 Washington Street, Box 314, Boston, MA, 02111, USA.']","Lester Y Leung, Paul K J Han, Christine Lundquist, Gene Weinstein, David E Thaler, David M Kent, ",Journal of patient-reported outcomes,2019,Counseling; Incidental; Patient centered outcomes research; Patient preferences; Silent brain infarction; Silent brain infarcts; Silent stroke; Stroke; Uncertainty.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30982930

      We aimed to address deficiencies in structured electronic health record (EHR) data for race and ethnicity by identifying black and Hispanic patients from unstructured clinical notes and assessing differences between patients with or without structured race/ethnicity data. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      Using EHR notes for 16 665 patients with encounters at a primary care practice, we developed rule-based natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to classify patients as black/Hispanic. We evaluated performance of the method against an annotated gold standard, compared race and ethnicity between NLP-derived and structured EHR data, and compared characteristics of patients identified as black or Hispanic using only NLP vs patients identified as such only in structured EHR data. Results:
      
    

    
      For the sample of 16 665 patients, NLP identified 948 additional patients as black, a 26%increase, and 665 additional patients as Hispanic, a 20% increase. Compared with the patients identified as black or Hispanic in structured EHR data, patients identified as black or Hispanic via NLP only were older, more likely to be male, less likely to have commercial insurance, and more likely to have higher comorbidity. Discussion:
      
    

    
      Structured EHR data for race and ethnicity are subject to data quality issues. Supplementing structured EHR race data with NLP-derived race and ethnicity may allow researchers to better assess the demographic makeup of populations and draw more accurate conclusions about intergroup differences in health outcomes.

This technique can provide important clues for biologically active molecules, which is useful in the following researches of durg discovery. In this work, combining with Word2vec, a natural language processing technique, dense fully connected neural network (DFCNN) algorithm is utilized to build up a prediction model. This model is able to perform a binary classification. Based on the query molecule, the input protein candidates can be classified into two subsets. One set is that potential targets with high possibilities to bind with the query molecule and the other one is that the proteins with low possibilities to bind with the query molecule. This model is named as IVS2vec. IVS2vec also can output a score reflecting binding possibility of the association between a protein and a molecule, which is useful to improve efficiency of research. We applied IVS2vec on several databases related to drug development and shown that our model can detect possible therapeutic targets. In addition, our model can identify targets related to adverse drug reactions which is useful to improve medication safety and repurpose drugs. Moreover, IVS2vec can give a very fast speed to perform prediction jobs. It is suitable for processing a large number of compounds in the chemical databases.

      Emergency department information systems (EDIS) facilitate free-text data use for clinical research; however, no study has validated whether the Next Stage ER system (NSER), an EDIS used in Japan, accurately translates electronic medical records (EMRs) into structured data. Methods:
      
    

    
      This is a retrospective cohort study using data from the emergency department (ED) of a tertiary care hospital from 2018 to 2019. We used EMRs of 500 random samples from 27,000 ED visits during the study period. Through the NSER system, chief complaints were translated into 231 chief complaint categories based on the Japan Triage and Acuity Scale. Medical history and physician's diagnoses were encoded using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision; medications were encoded as Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System codes. Two reviewers independently reviewed 20 items (e.g., presence of fever) for each study component (e.g., chief complaints). We calculated association measures of the structured data by the NSER system, using the chart review results as the gold standard. Results:
      
    

    
      Sensitivities were very high (>90%) in 17 chief complaints. Positive predictive values were high for 14 chief complaints (≥80%). Negative predictive values were ≥96% for all chief complaints. For medical history and medications, most of the association measures were very high (>90%). For physicians' ED diagnoses, sensitivities were very high (>93%) in 16 diagnoses; specificities and negative predictive values were very high (>97%). Conclusions:

1461,"""Tobacco and Water"": Testing the Health Halo Effect of Natural American Spirit Cigarette Ads and Its Relationship with Perceived Absolute Harm and Use Intentions","In 2015, the FDA formally warned Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company that their ""natural"" and ""additive-free"" claims for its Natural American Spirit cigarettes conveyed reduced harm to consumers. In a settlement, Santa Fe was allowed to continue using the word ""natural"" in the brand name and the phrase ""tobacco and water"". The company also uses eco-friendly language and plant imagery and these tactics have also been shown to communicate reduced product harm. In this study, we propose the health halo effect as an overarching framework for explaining how these ad tactics mislead consumers in an effort to provide more comprehensive guidance for regulatory action. In a between-subjects experiment, 1,577 US young adults, ages 18-24, were randomly assigned to view one of five Natural American Spirit cigarette ads featuring either: 1) eco-friendly language; 2) plant imagery; 3) the phrase ""tobacco and water""; 4) all of these tactics; or 5) a control condition featuring none of these tactics. In line with past research, ads with the phrase ""tobacco and water"" or with all the tactics together (vs. control) created a health halo effect, increasing perceptions that Natural American Spirit cigarettes were healthier and had less potential to cause disease; these tactics also had an indirect positive effect on smoking intentions through reduced perceptions of the brand's potential to cause disease and perceived absolute harm. Inconsistent with prior work, the eco-friendly language and plant imagery (vs. control) reduced healthfulness perceptions, increased perceptions of absolute harm, and had an indirect negative effect on smoking intentions. We contribute to past research showing that Natural American Spirit cigarette ad tactics mislead consumers. Inconsistent findings are explained in terms of stimuli design and processing of message features, indices of relative message persuasiveness, and multiple versus single-message designs.","['1 Cancer Prevention Fellowship Program, Division of Cancer Prevention, National Cancer Institute.', '2 Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.', '3 School of Community Health Sciences, University of Nevada at Reno.', ""4 O'Neill Institute for National & Global Health Law, Georgetown University Law Center."", '5 Department of Health, Behavior, and Society, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.']","Irina A Iles, Jennifer L Pearson, Eric Lindblom, Meghan Bridgid Moran, ",Health communication,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31922429
1462,Machine Learning in the OR: A Collaborative Environment for Surgical Interventions in Visceral Medicine,"Modern surgical methods are becoming increasingly sophisticated and the number of technical devices that are used during these interventions is increasing. However, the surgical operating room (OR) remains a mere conglomerate of unconnected medical devices. The increase in the complexity of device functionality, in addition to the demands of surgery, pushes human mental capacity to its limit. Hence, an ""intelligent"" collaborative support system would be more than welcome. We envision a ""human-like"" intelligent system, which could support the surgical team as a situation-aware consultant. This so-called ""active collaborative support system"" (ACSS) is based on four main pillars: real-time data inflow, a comprehensive knowledge-base, access to the Internet of Things (surgical devices), and an understanding of human language through natural language processing. Recent advances in the area of AI are bringing this ambitious goal within reach, but there is still a considerable amount of work to be done, including the establishment of a new way of thinking in the collaboration between surgeons and computer scientists/engineers, and possibly one day with intelligent machines-provided that AI systems can be sufficiently trusted.","['1 Research Group MITI, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technical University Munich, Munich, Germany.', '2 Research Group MITI, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technical University Munich, Munich, Germany, Department of Surgery, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technical University Munich, Munich, Germany.']","Daniel Ostler, Dirk Wilhelm, Lukas Bernhard, Jonas Fuchtmann, Michael Kranzfelder, Thomas Vogel, Hubertus Feussner, ",Surgical technology international,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32681728
1463,"PGxCorpus, a manually annotated corpus for pharmacogenomics","Pharmacogenomics (PGx) studies how individual gene variations impact drug response phenotypes, which makes PGx-related knowledge a key component towards precision medicine. A significant part of the state-of-the-art knowledge in PGx is accumulated in scientific publications, where it is hardly reusable by humans or software. Natural language processing techniques have been developed to guide experts who curate this amount of knowledge. But existing works are limited by the absence of a high quality annotated corpus focusing on PGx domain. In particular, this absence restricts the use of supervised machine learning. This article introduces PGxCorpus, a manually annotated corpus, designed to fill this gap and to enable the automatic extraction of PGx relationships from text. It comprises 945 sentences from 911 PubMed abstracts, annotated with PGx entities of interest (mainly gene variations, genes, drugs and phenotypes), and relationships between those. In this article, we present the corpus itself, its construction and a baseline experiment that illustrates how it may be leveraged to synthesize and summarize PGx knowledge.","['1 Université de Lorraine, CNRS, Inria, LORIA, Nancy, France. joel.legrand@inria.fr.', '2 Université de Lorraine, CNRS, Inria, LORIA, Nancy, France.', '3 Sorbonne Université, INSERM, Université Paris 13, LIMICS, Paris, France.', '4 Hôpital Européen Georges Pompidou, AP-HP, Université Paris Descartes, Université Sorbonne Paris Cité, Paris, France.', '5 INSERM UMR 1138 Equipe 22, Université Paris Descartes, Université Sorbonne Paris Cité, Paris, France.', '6 Department of Biomedical Informatics and Medical Education, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.', '7 INSERM U1256 - NGERE, Université de Lorraine, Nancy, France.', '8 Centre Régional de Pharmacovigilance, CHRU of Nancy, Nancy, France.', '9 Stanford Center for Biomedical Informatics Research, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA.']","Joël Legrand, Romain Gogdemir, Cédric Bousquet, Kevin Dalleau, Marie-Dominique Devignes, William Digan, Chia-Ju Lee, Ndeye-Coumba Ndiaye, Nadine Petitpain, Patrice Ringot, Malika Smaïl-Tabbone, Yannick Toussaint, Adrien Coulet, ",Scientific data,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31896797
1464,The Adverse Drug Reactions From Patient Reports in Social Media Project: Protocol for an Evaluation Against a Gold Standard,"Background:
      
    

    
      Social media is a potential source of information on postmarketing drug safety surveillance that still remains unexploited nowadays. Information technology solutions aiming at extracting adverse reactions (ADRs) from posts on health forums require a rigorous evaluation methodology if their results are to be used to make decisions. First, a gold standard, consisting of manual annotations of the ADR by human experts from the corpus extracted from social media, must be implemented and its quality must be assessed. Second, as for clinical research protocols, the sample size must rely on statistical arguments. Finally, the extraction methods must target the relation between the drug and the disease (which might be either treated or caused by the drug) rather than simple co-occurrences in the posts. Objective:
      
    

    
      We propose a standardized protocol for the evaluation of a software extracting ADRs from the messages on health forums. The study is conducted as part of the Adverse Drug Reactions from Patient Reports in Social Media project. Methods:
      
    

    
      Messages from French health forums were extracted. Entity recognition was based on Racine Pharma lexicon for drugs and Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities terminology for potential adverse events (AEs). Natural language processing-based techniques automated the ADR information extraction (relation between the drug and AE entities). The corpus of evaluation was a random sample of the messages containing drugs and/or AE concepts corresponding to recent pharmacovigilance alerts. A total of 2 persons experienced in medical terminology manually annotated the corpus, thus creating the gold standard, according to an annotator guideline. We will evaluate our tool against the gold standard with recall, precision, and f-measure. Interannotator agreement, reflecting gold standard quality, will be evaluated with hierarchical kappa. Granularities in the terminologies will be further explored. Results:
      
    

    
      Necessary and sufficient sample size was calculated to ensure statistical confidence in the assessed results. As we expected a global recall of 0.5, we needed at least 384 identified ADR concepts to obtain a 95% CI with a total width of 0.10 around 0.5. The automated ADR information extraction in the corpus for evaluation is already finished. The 2 annotators already completed the annotation process. The analysis of the performance of the ADR information extraction module as compared with gold standard is ongoing. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      This protocol is based on the standardized statistical methods from clinical research to create the corpus, thus ensuring the necessary statistical power of the assessed results. Such evaluation methodology is required to make the ADR information extraction software useful for postmarketing drug safety surveillance.

1465,"FIB-4 stage of liver fibrosis is associated with incident heart failure with preserved, but not reduced, ejection fraction among people with and without HIV or hepatitis C","Background:
      
    

    
      Liver fibrosis, is independently associated with incident heart failure (HF). Investigating the association between liver fibrosis and type of HF, specifically HF with reduced ejection fraction (EF; HFrEF) or HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), may provide mechanistic insight into this association. We sought to determine the association between liver fibrosis score (FIB-4) and type of HF, and to assess whether HIV or hepatitis C status modified this association. Methods:
      
    

    
      We included patients alive on or after 4/1/2003 from the Veterans Aging Cohort Study. We followed patients without prevalent cardiovascular disease until their first HF event, death, last clinic visit, or 9/30/2015. We defined liver fibrosis as: likely advanced fibrosis (FIB-4 > 3.25), indeterminate (FIB-4 range 1.45-3.25), unlikely advanced fibrosis (FIB-4 < 1.45). Primary outcomes were HFrEF and HFpEF (defined using ICD-9 diagnoses for HF, and EF extracted from electronic medical records using natural language processing). Cox proportional hazards models were adjusted for potential confounders and used to estimate hazard ratios (HR). Results:
      
    

    
      Among 108,708 predominantly male (96%) participants mean age was 49 years. Likely advanced fibrosis was present in 4% at baseline and was associated with an increased risk of HFpEF [HR (95% confidence interval)] [1.70 (1.3-2.3)]; and non-significantly with HFrEF [1.20 (0.9-1.7)]. These associations were not modified by HIV or hepatitis C status. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Likely advanced fibrosis was independently associated with incident HFpEF but not HFrEF. This suggests that risk factors and/or mechanisms for liver fibrosis may have greater overlap with those for HFpEF than HFrEF.","['1 Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.

1466,Newborn infants differently process adult directed and infant directed speech,"Infant directed speech (IDS) may serve important functions in language acquisition and in adult-infant communication. The processing of IDS evolves during the first years of life. In order to serve as an effective tool of language acquisition, already very young infants should be able to distinguish IDS from adult directed speech (ADS). We tested whether the ability to discriminate these two speech registers is functional in neonates, by recording EEG from 98 newborn infants in response to Hungarian words naturally spoken in the IDS and the ADS register. Words presented in the ADS register elicited a centro-parietal slow positivity in the 200-600 ms time window whereas words in IDS register elicited a small frontal negativity in the 700-900 ms time window. We conclude that newborn infants differentiate natural speech sounds based on speech register.","['1 Research Centre for Natural Sciences, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Magyar tudósok körútja 2, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary.

1467,Spiking neurons from tunable Gaussian heterojunction transistors,"Spiking neural networks exploit spatiotemporal processing, spiking sparsity, and high interneuron bandwidth to maximize the energy efficiency of neuromorphic computing. While conventional silicon-based technology can be used in this context, the resulting neuron-synapse circuits require multiple transistors and complicated layouts that limit integration density. Here, we demonstrate unprecedented electrostatic control of dual-gated Gaussian heterojunction transistors for simplified spiking neuron implementation. These devices employ wafer-scale mixed-dimensional van der Waals heterojunctions consisting of chemical vapor deposited monolayer molybdenum disulfide and solution-processed semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes to emulate the spike-generating ion channels in biological neurons. Circuits based on these dual-gated Gaussian devices enable a variety of biological spiking responses including phasic spiking, delayed spiking, and tonic bursting. In addition to neuromorphic computing, the tunable Gaussian response has significant implications for a range of other applications including telecommunications, computer vision, and natural language processing.","['1 Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, 60208, USA.', '2 Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Chicago, IL, 60607, USA.', '3 Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, 60208, USA. m-hersam@northwestern.edu.', '4 Department of Chemistry, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, 60208, USA. m-hersam@northwestern.edu.', '5 Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, 60208, USA. m-hersam@northwestern.edu.']","Megan E Beck, Ahish Shylendra, Vinod K Sangwan, Silu Guo, William A Gaviria Rojas, Hocheon Yoo, Hadallia Bergeron, Katherine Su, Amit R Trivedi, Mark C Hersam, ",Nature communications,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32218433
1468,Primary Care Opioid Taper Plans Are Associated with Sustained Opioid Dose Reduction,"Background:
      
    

    
      Primary care providers prescribe most long-term opioid therapy and are increasingly asked to taper the opioid doses of these patients to safer levels. A recent systematic review suggests that multiple interventions may facilitate opioid taper, but many of these are not feasible within the usual primary care practice. Objective:
      
    

    
      To determine if opioid taper plans documented by primary care providers in the electronic health record are associated with significant and sustained opioid dose reductions among patients on long-term opioid therapy. Design:
      
    

    
      A nested case-control design was used to compare cases (patients with a sustained opioid taper defined as average daily opioid dose of ≤ 30 mg morphine equivalent (MME) or a 50% reduction in MME) to controls (patients matched to cases on year and quarter of cohort entry, sex, and age group, who had not achieved a sustained taper). Each case was matched with four controls. Participants:
      
    

    
      Two thousand four hundred nine patients receiving a ≥ 60-day supply of opioids with an average daily dose of ≥ 50 MME during 2011-2015. Main measures:
      
    

    
      Opioid taper plans documented in prescription instructions or clinical notes within the electronic health record identified through natural language processing; opioid dosing, patient characteristics, and taper plan components also abstracted from the electronic health record. Key results:
      
    

    
      Primary care taper plans were associated with an increased likelihood of sustained opioid taper after adjusting for all patient covariates and near peak dose (OR = 3.63 [95% CI 2.96-4.46], p < 0.0001). Both taper plans in prescription instructions (OR = 4.03 [95% CI 3.19-5.09], p < 0.0001) and in clinical notes (OR = 2.82 [95% CI 2.00-3.99], p < 0.0001) were associated with sustained taper. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      These results suggest that planning for opioid taper during primary care visits may facilitate significant and sustained opioid dose reduction.","['1 University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA. sullimar@uw.edu.', '2 Kaiser Permanente Washington Research Institute, Seattle, WA, USA.']","Mark D Sullivan, Denise Boudreau, Laura Ichikawa, David Cronkite, Ladia Albertson-Junkans, Gladys Salgado, Michael VonKorff, David S Carrell, ",Journal of general internal medicine,2020 Mar,case-control study; dose reduction; long-term opioid therapy; natural language processing; opioid discontinuation.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31907789

      Falls are common adverse events in hospitals, frequently leading to additional health costs due to prolonged stays and extra care. Therefore, reliable fall detection is vital to develop and test fall prevention strategies. However, conventional methods-voluntary incident reports and manual chart reviews-are error-prone and time consuming, respectively. Using a search algorithm to examine patients' electronic health record data and flag fall indicators offers an inexpensive, sensitive, cost-effective alternative. Objective:
      
    

    
      This study's purpose was to develop a fall detection algorithm for use with electronic health record data, then to evaluate it alongside the Global Trigger Tool, incident reports, a manual chart review, and patient-reported falls. Methods:
      
    

    
      Conducted on 2 campuses of a large hospital system in Switzerland, this retrospective diagnostic accuracy study consisted of 2 substudies: the first, targeting 240 patients, for algorithm development and the second, targeting 298 patients, for validation. In the development study, we compared the new algorithm's in-hospital fall rates with those indicated by the Global Trigger Tool and incident reports; in the validation study, we compared the algorithm's in-hospital fall rates with those from patient-reported falls and manual chart review. We compared the various methods by calculating sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values. Results:
      
    

    
      Twenty in-hospital falls were discovered in the development study sample. Of these, the algorithm detected 19 (sensitivity 95%), the Global Trigger Tool detected 18 (90%), and incident reports detected 14 (67%). Of the 15 falls found in the validation sample, the algorithm identified all 15 (100%), the manual chart review identified 14 (93%), and the patient-reported fall measure identified 5 (33%). Owing to relatively high numbers of false positives based on falls present on admission, the algorithm's positive predictive values were 50% (development sample) and 47% (validation sample). Instead of requiring 10 minutes per case for a full manual review or 20 minutes to apply the Global Trigger Tool, the algorithm requires only a few seconds, after which only the positive results (roughly 11% of the full case number) require review. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The newly developed electronic health record algorithm demonstrated very high sensitivity for fall detection. Applied in near real time, the algorithm can record in-hospital falls events effectively and help to develop and test fall prevention measures.","['1 MediZentrum Täuffelen, Täuffelen, Switzerland.', '2 Nursing & Midwifery Research Unit, Inselspital Bern University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland.', '3 Department of General Internal Medicine, Inselspital Bern University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland.', '4 Institute of Nursing Science, Department of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.']","Elisa Dolci, Barbara Schärer, Nicole Grossmann, Sarah Naima Musy, Franziska Zúñiga, Stefanie Bachnick, Michael Simon, ",Journal of medical Internet research,2020,adverse event; algorithm; falls; harm; natural language processing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32955445

      Interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) have been proven to impair cognitive function. However, it is not clear whether IEDs disrupt academic performance in children with idiopathic epilepsy, and the contribution of cognitive function deficits to impaired academic performance has not been clarified. This study aimed to examine the cognitive deficits and academic impairment in childhood idiopathic epilepsy with IEDs. Methods:
      
    

    
      Ninety-seven childhood idiopathic epilepsy with IEDs, 77 childhood idiopathic epilepsy without IEDs, and 71 healthy controls completed a series of cognitive tests. We analyzed the cognitive performance in several domains including language, mathematics, psychomotor speed, spatial ability, memory, general intelligence, attention and executive functioning. Analysis of variance was conducted to compare the performance on all tests between the three groups. Results:
      
    

    
      Childhood idiopathic epilepsy with IEDs exhibited not only general cognitive deficits in processing speed, spatial ability, and attention, but also arithmetic impairment. Furthermore, general cognitive deficits could account for the impaired arithmetic performance in childhood idiopathic epilepsy with IEDs. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our study suggested that IEDs in children with idiopathic epilepsy affected both cognitive function and academic performance, and that the cognitive deficits may be responsible for arithmetic performance impairment.","['1 Department of Pediatric Neurology, Capital Institute of Pediatrics, Beijing, 100020, China.', '2 National Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning, Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, 100875, China.', '3 Department of Pediatric Neurology, Capital Institute of Pediatrics, Beijing, 100020, China. chenqianxhl@163.com.']","Dazhi Cheng, Xiuxian Yan, Keming Xu, Xinlin Zhou, Qian Chen, ",BMC neurology,2020,Academic performance; Cognitive function; Idiopathic epilepsy; Interictal epileptiform discharges; Neuropsychological tests.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32505173
1473,Speech Processing Difficulties in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,"The large body of research that forms the ease of language understanding (ELU) model emphasizes the important contribution of cognitive processes when listening to speech in adverse conditions; however, speech-in-noise (SIN) processing is yet to be thoroughly tested in populations with cognitive deficits. The purpose of the current study was to contribute to the field in this regard by assessing SIN performance in a sample of adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and comparing results with age-matched controls. This population was chosen because core symptoms of ADHD include developmental deficits in cognitive control and working memory capacity and because these top-down processes are thought to reach maturity during adolescence in individuals with typical development. The study utilized natural language sentence materials under experimental conditions that manipulated the dependency on cognitive mechanisms in varying degrees. In addition, participants were tested on cognitive capacity measures of complex working memory-span, selective attention, and lexical access. Primary findings were in support of the ELU-model. Age was shown to significantly covary with SIN performance, and after controlling for age, ADHD participants demonstrated greater difficulty than controls with the experimental manipulations. In addition, overall SIN performance was strongly predicted by individual differences in cognitive capacity. Taken together, the results highlight the general disadvantage persons with deficient cognitive capacity have when attending to speech in typically noisy listening environments. Furthermore, the consistently poorer performance observed in the ADHD group suggests that auditory processing tasks designed to tax attention and working memory capacity may prove to be beneficial clinical instruments when diagnosing ADHD.","['1 Disability Research Division, Institute for Behavioral Science and Learning, Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden.', '2 Faculty of Teacher Education Arts and Sports, Western Norway University of Applied Sciences, Sogndal, Norway.']","Rina Blomberg, Henrik Danielsson, Mary Rudner, Göran B W Söderlund, Jerker Rönnberg, ",Frontiers in psychology,2019,adolescents; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; auditory; cognitive control; speech in noise; speech processing; working memory.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31333549
1474,Bootstrapping Knowledge Graphs From Images and Text,"The problem of generating structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs) is difficult and open but relevant to a range of tasks related to decision making and information augmentation. A promising approach is to study generating KGs as a relational representation of inputs (e.g., textual paragraphs or natural images), where nodes represent the entities and edges represent the relations. This procedure is naturally a mixture of two phases: extracting primary relations from input, and completing the KG with reasoning. In this paper, we propose a hybrid KG builder that combines these two phases in a unified framework and generates KGs from scratch. Specifically, we employ a neural relation extractor resolving primary relations from input and a differentiable inductive logic programming (ILP) model that iteratively completes the KG. We evaluate our framework in both textual and visual domains and achieve comparable performance on relation extraction datasets based on Wikidata and the Visual Genome. The framework surpasses neural baselines by a noticeable gap in reasoning out dense KGs and overall performs particularly well for rare relations.","['1 Natural Language Processing Lab, Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.', '2 Knowledge Technology Group, Department of Informatics, University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany.']","Jiayuan Mao, Yuan Yao, Stefan Heinrich, Tobias Hinz, Cornelius Weber, Stefan Wermter, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun, ",Frontiers in neurorobotics,2019,inductive logic programming; information extraction; knowledge graphs; relation learning; relation prediction.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31798437
1475,Can Machine Learning Methods Produce Accurate and Easy-to-use Prediction Models of 30-day Complications and Mortality After Knee or Hip Arthroplasty?,"Background:
      
    

    
      Existing universal and procedure-specific surgical risk prediction models of death and major complications after elective total joint arthroplasty (TJA) have limitations including poor transparency, poor to modest accuracy, and insufficient validation to establish performance across diverse settings. Thus, the need remains for accurate and validated prediction models for use in preoperative management, informed consent, shared decision-making, and risk adjustment for reimbursement. Questions/purposes:
      
    

    
      The purpose of this study was to use machine learning methods and large national databases to develop and validate (both internally and externally) parsimonious risk-prediction models for mortality and complications after TJA. Methods:
      
    

    
      Preoperative demographic and clinical variables from all 107,792 nonemergent primary THAs and TKAs in the 2013 to 2014 American College of Surgeons-National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) were evaluated as predictors of 30-day death and major complications. The NSQIP database was chosen for its high-quality data on important outcomes and rich characterization of preoperative demographic and clinical predictors for demographically and geographically diverse patients. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, a type of machine learning that optimizes accuracy and parsimony, was used for model development. Tenfold validation was used to produce C-statistics, a measure of how well models discriminate patients who experience an outcome from those who do not. External validation, which evaluates the generalizability of the models to new data sources and patient groups, was accomplished using data from the Veterans Affairs Surgical Quality Improvement Program (VASQIP). Models previously developed from VASQIP data were also externally validated using NSQIP data to examine the generalizability of their performance with a different group of patients outside the VASQIP context. Results:
      
    

    
      The models, developed using LASSO regression with diverse clinical (for example, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, comorbidities) and demographic (for example, age, gender) inputs, had good accuracy in terms of discriminating the likelihood a patient would experience, within 30 days of arthroplasty, a renal complication (C-statistic, 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76-0.80), death (0.73; 95% CI, 0.70-0.76), or a cardiac complication (0.73; 95% CI, 0.71-0.75) from one who would not. By contrast, the models demonstrated poor accuracy for venous thromboembolism (C-statistic, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.60-0.62) and any complication (C-statistic, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.63-0.65). External validation of the NSQIP- derived models using VASQIP data found them to be robust in terms of predictions about mortality and cardiac complications, but not for predicting renal complications. Models previously developed with VASQIP data had poor accuracy when externally validated with NSQIP data, suggesting they should not be used outside the context of the Veterans Health Administration. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Moderately accurate predictive models of 30-day mortality and cardiac complications after elective primary TJA were developed as well as internally and externally validated. To our knowledge, these are the most accurate and rigorously validated TJA-specific prediction models currently available (http://med.stanford.edu/s-spire/Resources/clinical-tools-.html). Methods to improve these models, including the addition of nonstandard inputs such as natural language processing of preoperative clinical progress notes or radiographs, should be pursued as should the development and validation of models to predict longer term improvements in pain and function.

1476,Family history information extraction via deep joint learning,"Family history (FH) information, including family members, side of family of family members (i.e., maternal or paternal), living status of family members, observations (diseases) of family members, etc., is very important in the decision-making process of disorder diagnosis and treatment. However FH information cannot be used directly by computers as it is always embedded in unstructured text in electronic health records (EHRs). In order to extract FH information form clinical text, there is a need of natural language processing (NLP). In the BioCreative/OHNLP2018 challenge, there is a task regarding FH extraction (i.e., task1), including two subtasks: (1) entity identification, identifying family members and their observations (diseases) mentioned in clinical text; (2) family history extraction, extracting side of family of family members, living status of family members, and observations of family members. For this task, we propose a system based on deep joint learning methods to extract FH information. Our system achieves the highest F1- scores of 0.8901 on subtask1 and 0.6359 on subtask2, respectively.","['1 Key Laboratory of Network Oriented Intelligent Computation, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China.', '2 Yidu Cloud (Beijing) Technology Co.,Ltd, Beijing, China.', '3 Key Laboratory of Network Oriented Intelligent Computation, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China. tangbuzhou@gmail.com.']","Xue Shi, Dehuan Jiang, Yuanhang Huang, Xiaolong Wang, Qingcai Chen, Jun Yan, Buzhou Tang, ",BMC medical informatics and decision making,2019,Deep joint learning; Entity identification; Family history extraction; Family history information.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31881967
1477,Effects of the Co-occurrence of Anxiety and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder on Intrinsic Functional Network Centrality among Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder,"Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) present with a high co-occurrence of anxiety and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, it remains unclear how the co-occurrence of anxiety and ADHD in children with ASD alters whole-brain functional networks. Here, we aimed to examine anxiety- and ADHD-related brain network centrality in children with ASD separately and their relationships with ASD symptoms. Clinical anxiety and ADHD levels in children with ASD, aged 6-13 years old, were assessed. Participants were categorized into four groups: ASD only (n = 28), ASD + anxiety (n = 19), ASD + ADHD (n = 25), and ASD + both anxiety and ADHD (n = 28). Subsequently, we compared voxel-wise network degree centrality (DC) among the four groups. We found that: (a) compared with ASD only, children with ASD + anxiety showed higher DC in the left middle temporal gyrus, right lingual gyrus, and left cuneus, and lower DC in the right precuneus; (b) children with ASD + ADHD presented higher DC in the right calcarine and left superior frontal gyrus (SFG) compared with ASD only; (c) children with ASD + both displayed higher DC in the right calcarine and lower centrality in the right middle occipital gyrus compared with ASD only; and (d) across all children with ASD, there was a positive correlation between DC of the right calcarine with nonverbal behavior scores, and DC of the left SFG was negatively correlated with social scores. Our findings suggest that the right calcarine, left SFG, and default mode network nodes play important roles in the co-occurrence of anxiety and ADHD among children with ASD. Autism Res 2019, 12: 1057-1068. © 2019 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: The co-occurrence of anxiety and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been shown to influence the brain function of children with ASD. In order to gain a better understanding of this, the present study compared degree centrality, the amount of effective brain functional connectivity that reflects the characteristics of brain networks, among four groups: ASD only, ASD + anxiety, ASD + ADHD, and ASD + both anxiety and ADHD. We found that some areas located in the language processing network and primary visual cortex were associated with the co-occurrence of ADHD, and some other areas located in the default mode network were associated with the co-occurrence of both anxiety and ADHD. These findings provide more knowledge about the neural basis underlying behavioral changes related to the co-occurrence of anxiety and ADHD in children with ASD.","['1 Department of Maternal and Child Health, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', '2 Department of Neuropsychiatry, University of Fukui, Fukui, Japan.', '3 Department of Medical Radiology, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China.']","Bin Wan, Zengjian Wang, Minyoung Jung, Yanchun Lu, Haoqiang He, Qi Chen, Yu Jin, ",Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research,2019 Jul,ADHD; anxiety; autism spectrum disorder; functional degree centrality.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31074587

Some kinds of MWEs, such as verbal ones, are particularly hard to identify in corpora, due to their high degree of morphosyntactic flexibility. This paper describes a linguistically motivated method to gather detailed information about verb+noun MWEs (VNMWEs) from corpora. Although the main focus of this study is Spanish, the method is easily adaptable to other languages. Monolingual and parallel corpora are used as input, and data about the morphosyntactic variability of VNMWEs is extracted. This information is then tested in an identification task, obtaining an F score of 0.52, which is considerably higher than related work.","['1 HiTZ Basque center for language technologies, Ixa NLP group, University of the Basque Country, Leioa, Spain.', '2 Department of Catalan Philology and General Linguistics, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.']","Uxoa Inurrieta, Itziar Aduriz, Arantza Díaz de Ilarraza, Gorka Labaka, Kepa Sarasola, ",PloS one,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32853283
1479,Computerised cognitive training for 12 or more weeks for maintaining cognitive function in cognitively healthy people in late life,"Background:
      
    

    
      Increasing age is associated with a natural decline in cognitive function and is the greatest risk factor for dementia. Cognitive decline and dementia are significant threats to independence and quality of life in older adults. Therefore, identifying interventions that help to maintain cognitive function in older adults or that reduce the risk of dementia is a research priority. Cognitive training uses repeated practice on standardised exercises targeting one or more cognitive domains and may be intended to improve or maintain optimal cognitive function. This review examines the effects of computerised cognitive training interventions lasting at least 12 weeks on the cognitive function of healthy adults aged 65 or older and has formed part of a wider project about modifying lifestyle to maintain cognitive function. We chose a minimum 12 weeks duration as a trade-off between adequate exposure to a sustainable intervention and feasibility in a trial setting. Objectives:
      
    

    
      To evaluate the effects of computerised cognitive training interventions lasting at least 12 weeks on cognitive function in cognitively healthy people in late life. Search methods:
      
    

    
      We searched to 31 March 2018 in ALOIS (www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois), and we performed additional searches of MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO Portal/ICTRP (www.apps.who.int/trialsearch), to ensure that the search was as comprehensive and as up-to-date as possible to identify published, unpublished, and ongoing trials. Selection criteria:
      
    

    
      We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs, published or unpublished, reported in any language. Participants were cognitively healthy people, and at least 80% of the study population had to be aged 65 or older. Experimental interventions adhered to the following criteria: intervention was any form of interactive computerised cognitive intervention - including computer exercises, computer games, mobile devices, gaming console, and virtual reality - that involved repeated practice on standardised exercises of specified cognitive domain(s) for the purpose of enhancing cognitive function; the duration of the intervention was at least 12 weeks; cognitive outcomes were measured; and cognitive training interventions were compared with active or inactive control interventions. Data collection and analysis:
      
    

    
      We performed preliminary screening of search results using a 'crowdsourcing' method to identify RCTs. At least two review authors working independently screened the remaining citations against inclusion criteria. At least two review authors also independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included RCTs. Where appropriate, we synthesised data in random-effects meta-analyses, comparing computerised cognitive training (CCT) separately with active and inactive controls. We expressed treatment effects as standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used GRADE methods to describe the overall quality of the evidence for each outcome. Main results:
      
    

    
      We identified eight RCTs with a total of 1183 participants. The duration of the interventions ranged from 12 to 26 weeks; in five trials, the duration of intervention was 12 or 13 weeks. The included studies had moderate risk of bias, and the overall quality of evidence was low or very low for all outcomes. We compared CCT first against active control interventions, such as watching educational videos. Negative SMDs favour CCT over control. Trial results suggest slight improvement in global cognitive function at the end of the intervention period (12 weeks) (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.57 to -0.05; 232 participants; 2 studies; low-quality evidence). One of these trials also assessed global cognitive function 12 months after the end of the intervention; this trial provided no clear evidence of a persistent effect (SMD -0.21, 95% CI -0.66 to 0.24; 77 participants; 1 study; low-quality evidence). CCT may result in little or no difference at the end of the intervention period in episodic memory (12 to 17 weeks) (SMD 0.06, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.26; 439 participants; 4 studies; low-quality evidence) or working memory (12 to 16 weeks) (SMD -0.17, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.02; 392 participants; 3 studies; low-quality evidence). Because of the very low quality of the evidence, we are very uncertain about the effects of CCT on speed of processing and executive function. We also compared CCT to inactive control (no interventions). We found no data on our primary outcome of global cognitive function. At the end of the intervention, CCT may lead to slight improvement in episodic memory (6 months) (mean difference (MD) in Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test (RBMT) -0.90 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.73 to -0.07; 150 participants; 1 study; low-quality evidence) but can have little or no effect on executive function (12 weeks to 6 months) (SMD -0.08, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.15; 292 participants; 2 studies; low-quality evidence), working memory (16 weeks) (MD -0.08, 95% CI -0.43 to 0.27; 60 participants; 1 study; low-quality evidence), or verbal fluency (6 months) (MD -0.11, 95% CI -1.58 to 1.36; 150 participants; 1 study; low-quality evidence). We could not determine any effects on speed of processing because the evidence was of very low quality. We found no evidence on quality of life, activities of daily living, or adverse effects in either comparison. Authors' conclusions:
      
    

    
      We found low-quality evidence suggesting that immediately after completion of the intervention, small benefits of CCT may be seen for global cognitive function when compared with active controls, and for episodic memory when compared with an inactive control. These benefits are of uncertain clinical importance. We found no evidence that the effect on global cognitive function persisted 12 months later. Our confidence in the results was low, reflecting the overall quality of the evidence. In five of the eight trials, the duration of the intervention was just three months. The possibility that more extensive training could yield larger benefit remains to be more fully explored. We found substantial literature on cognitive training, and collating all available scientific information posed problems. Duration of treatment may not be the best way to categorise interventions for inclusion. As the primary interest of older people and of guideline writers and policymakers involves sustained cognitive benefit, an alternative would be to categorise by length of follow-up after selecting studies that assess longer-term effects.","['1 University of New South Wales, Centre for Healthy Brain Ageing (CHeBA), Suite 407 185 Elizabeth Street, Sydney, NSW, Australia, 2000.', '2 University of Bern, Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM), Mittelstrasse 43, Bern, Bern, Switzerland, 3012.', '3 University of Bern, Institute of Primary Health Care (BIHAM), Mittelstrasse 43, Bern, Bern, Switzerland, 3012.', '4 University ""G.

1482,Exploration of Artificial Intelligence Use with ARIES in Multiple Myeloma Research,"Background:
      
    

    
      Natural language processing (NLP) is a powerful tool supporting the generation of Real-World Evidence (RWE). There is no NLP system that enables the extensive querying of parameters specific to multiple myeloma (MM) out of unstructured medical reports. We therefore created a MM-specific ontology to accelerate the information extraction (IE) out of unstructured text. Methods:
      
    

    
      Our MM ontology consists of extensive MM-specific and hierarchically structured attributes and values. We implemented ""A Rule-based Information Extraction System"" (ARIES) that uses this ontology. We evaluated ARIES on 200 randomly selected medical reports of patients diagnosed with MM. Results:
      
    

    
      Our system achieved a high F1-Score of 0.92 on the evaluation dataset with a precision of 0.87 and recall of 0.98. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our rule-based IE system enables the comprehensive querying of medical reports. The IE accelerates the extraction of data and enables clinicians to faster generate RWE on hematological issues. RWE helps clinicians to make decisions in an evidence-based manner. Our tool easily accelerates the integration of research evidence into everyday clinical practice.","['1 Department of Internal Medicine II, University Hospital Würzburg, 97080 Würzburg, Germany.

These studies require longitudinally measured dose, outcomes, and covariates in large numbers of patients; however, prospective data collection is cost-prohibitive. Electronic health records (EHRs) can be an excellent source for such data, but there are challenges, including accurate ascertainment of drug dose. We developed a standardized system to prepare datasets from EHRs for population PK/PD studies. Our system handles a variety of tasks involving data extraction from clinical text using a natural language processing algorithm, data processing, and data building. Applying this system, we performed a fentanyl population PK analysis, resulting in comparable parameter estimates to a prior study. This new system makes the EHR data extraction and preparation process more efficient and accurate and provides a powerful tool to facilitate postmarketing population PK/PD studies using information available in EHRs.","['1 Department of Biostatistics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', '2 Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', '3 Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', '4 Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', '5 Department of Pharmacology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', '6 Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.']","Leena Choi, Cole Beck, Elizabeth McNeer, Hannah L Weeks, Michael L Williams, Nathan T James, Xinnan Niu, Bassel W Abou-Khalil, Kelly A Birdwell, Dan M Roden, C Michael Stein, Cosmin A Bejan, Joshua C Denny, Sara L Van Driest, ",Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,2020 Apr,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31957870

We show that language can also shape our knowledge about visual objects. We investigated sign language that enables deaf individuals to communicate through hand movements with as much expressive power as any other natural language. A few signs represent objects in a specific orientation. Sign-language users (signers) recognized visual objects faster when oriented as in the sign, and this match in orientation elicited specific brain responses in signers, as measured by event-related potentials (ERPs). Further analyses suggested that signers' responsiveness to object orientation derived from changes in the visual object representations induced by the signs. Our results also show that language facilitates discrimination between objects of the same kind (e.g., different cars), an effect never reported before with spoken languages. By focusing on sign language we could better characterize the impact of language (a uniquely human ability) on object visual processing.","['1 Dipartimento di Psicologia dello Sviluppo e della Socializzazione, Università di Padova, Padova, 35137, Italy.', '2 Columbia University, New York, 10027, USA.', '3 Dipartimento di Psicologia dello Sviluppo e della Socializzazione, Università di Padova, Padova, 35137, Italy. francesca.peressotti@unipd.it.']","Eduardo Navarrete, Michele Miozzo, Francesca Peressotti, ",Scientific reports,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32439859

      To apply machine learning to create an algorithm that predicts CRT outcome using electronic health record (EHR) data avaible before the procedure. Methods and results:
      
    

    
      We applied machine learning and natural language processing to the EHR of 990 patients who received CRT at two academic hospitals between 2004-2015. The primary outcome was reduced CRT benefit, defined as <0% improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 6-18 months post-procedure or death by 18 months. Data regarding demographics, laboratory values, medications, clinical characteristics, and past health services utilization were extracted from the EHR available before the CRT procedure. Bigrams (i.e., two-word sequences) were also extracted from the clinical notes using natural language processing. Patients accrued on average 75 clinical notes (SD, 29) before the procedure including data not captured anywhere else in the EHR. A machine learning model was built using 80% of the patient sample (training and validation dataset), and tested on a held-out 20% patient sample (test dataset). Among 990 patients receiving CRT the mean age was 71.6 (SD, 11.8), 78.1% were male, 87.2% non-Hispanic white, and the mean baseline LVEF was 24.8% (SD, 7.69). Out of 990 patients, 403 (40.7%) were identified as having a reduced benefit from the CRT device (<0% LVEF improvement in 25.2%, death by 18 months in 15.6%). The final model identified 26% of these patients at a positive predictive value of 79% (model performance: Fβ (β = 0.1): 77%; recall 0.26; precision 0.79; accuracy 0.65). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      A machine learning model that leveraged readily available EHR data and clinical notes identified a subset of CRT patients who may not benefit from CRT before the procedure.","['1 Department of Radiology, Masachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.', '2 Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, CSAIL, MIT, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.', '3 Department of Health Policy and Management, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.', '4 Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States of America.', '5 Richard A. and Susan F.

1487,Text mining brain imaging reports,"Background:
      
    

    
      With the improvements to text mining technology and the availability of large unstructured Electronic Healthcare Records (EHR) datasets, it is now possible to extract structured information from raw text contained within EHR at reasonably high accuracy. We describe a text mining system for classifying radiologists' reports of CT and MRI brain scans, assigning labels indicating occurrence and type of stroke, as well as other observations. Our system, the Edinburgh Information Extraction for Radiology reports (EdIE-R) system, which we describe here, was developed and tested on a collection of radiology reports.The work reported in this paper is based on 1168 radiology reports from the Edinburgh Stroke Study (ESS), a hospital-based register of stroke and transient ischaemic attack patients. We manually created annotations for this data in parallel with developing the rule-based EdIE-R system to identify phenotype information related to stroke in radiology reports. This process was iterative and domain expert feedback was considered at each iteration to adapt and tune the EdIE-R text mining system which identifies entities, negation and relations between entities in each report and determines report-level labels (phenotypes). Results:
      
    

    
      The inter-annotator agreement (IAA) for all types of annotations is high at 96.96 for entities, 96.46 for negation, 95.84 for relations and 94.02 for labels. The equivalent system scores on the blind test set are equally high at 95.49 for entities, 94.41 for negation, 98.27 for relations and 96.39 for labels for the first annotator and 96.86, 96.01, 96.53 and 92.61, respectively for the second annotator. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Automated reading of such EHR data at such high levels of accuracies opens up avenues for population health monitoring and audit, and can provide a resource for epidemiological studies. We are in the process of validating EdIE-R in separate larger cohorts in NHS England and Scotland. The manually annotated ESS corpus will be available for research purposes on application.","['1 School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh, Informatics Forum, 10 Crichton Street, Edinburgh, UK. balex@ed.ac.uk.', '2 Edinburgh Futures Institute, School of Literatures, Languages and Cultures, University of Edinburgh, 50 George Square, Edinburgh, UK. balex@ed.ac.uk.', '3 The Alan Turing Institute, The British Library, 96 Euston Road, London, UK. balex@ed.ac.uk.', '4 School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh, Informatics Forum, 10 Crichton Street, Edinburgh, UK.', '5 The Alan Turing Institute, The British Library, 96 Euston Road, London, UK.', '6 Centre for Medical Informatics, University of Edinburgh, 9 Little France Road, Edinburgh, UK.', ""7 Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Chancellor's Building, 49 Little France Crescent, Edinburgh, UK.""]","Beatrice Alex, Claire Grover, Richard Tobin, Cathie Sudlow, Grant Mair, William Whiteley, ",Journal of biomedical semantics,2019,Electronic healthcare records; Neuroimaging reports; Stroke classification; Text mining.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31711539
1488,Multiple Source Localization in a Shallow Water Waveguide Exploiting Subarray Beamforming and Deep Neural Networks,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been shown to be effective for single sound source localization in shallow water environments. However, multiple source localization is a more challenging task because of the interactions among multiple acoustic signals. This paper proposes a framework for multiple source localization on underwater horizontal arrays using deep neural networks. The two-stage DNNs are adopted to determine both the directions and ranges of multiple sources successively. A feed-forward neural network is trained for direction finding, while the long short term memory recurrent neural network is used for source ranging. Particularly, in the source ranging stage, we perform subarray beamforming to extract features of sources that are detected by the direction finding stage, because subarray beamforming can enhance the mixed signal to the desired direction while preserving the horizontal-longitudinal correlations of the acoustic field. In this way, a universal model trained in the single-source scenario can be applied to multi-source scenarios with arbitrary numbers of sources. Both simulations and experiments in a range-independent shallow water environment of SWellEx-96 Event S5 are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","['1 Key Laboratory of Speech Acoustics and Content Understanding, Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, China. huangzhaoqiong@hccl.ioa.ac.cn.', '2 Key Laboratory of Speech Acoustics and Content Understanding, Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, China. xuji@hccl.ioa.ac.cn.', '3 State Key Laboratory of Acoustics, Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, China. gzx@mail.ioa.ac.cn.', '4 State Key Laboratory of Acoustics, Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, China. whb@mail.ioa.ac.cn.', '5 Key Laboratory of Speech Acoustics and Content Understanding, Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, China. yanyonghong@hccl.ioa.ac.cn.', '6 Xinjiang Key Laboratory of Minority Speech and Language Information Processing, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wulumuqi 830011, China. yanyonghong@hccl.ioa.ac.cn.']","Zhaoqiong Huang, Ji Xu, Zaixiao Gong, Haibin Wang, Yonghong Yan, ","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019,deep neural network; multiple source localization; shallow water environment; subarray beamforming.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31684045
1489,Antipsychotic use in dementia: the relationship between neuropsychiatric symptom profiles and adverse outcomes,"Antipsychotic treatments are associated with safety concerns in people with dementia. The authors aimed to investigate whether risk of adverse outcomes related to antipsychotic prescribing differed according to major neuropsychiatric syndromes-specifically psychosis, agitation, or a combination. A cohort of 10,106 patients with a diagnosis of dementia was assembled from a large dementia care database in South East London. Neuropsychiatric symptoms closest to first dementia diagnosis were determined according to the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales' mental and behavioural problem scores and the sample was divided into four groups: 'agitation and psychosis', 'agitation, but no psychosis', 'psychosis, but no agitation', and 'neither psychosis nor agitation'. Antipsychotic prescription in a one-year window around first dementia diagnosis was ascertained as exposure variable through natural language processing from free text. Cox regression models were used to analyse associations of antipsychotic prescription with all-cause and stroke-specific mortality, emergency hospitalisation and hospitalised stroke adjusting for sixteen potential confounders including demographics, cognition, functioning, as well as physical and mental health. Only in the group 'psychosis, but no agitation' (n = 579), 30% of whom were prescribed an antipsychotic, a significant antipsychotic-associated increased risk of hospitalised stroke was present after adjustment (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 2.16; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09-4.25). An increased antipsychotic-related all-cause (adjusted HR 1.14; 95% CI 1.04-1.24) and stroke-specific mortality risk (adjusted HR 1.28; 95% CI 1.01-1.63) was detected in the whole sample, but no interaction between the strata and antipsychotic-related mortality. In conclusion, the adverse effects of antipsychotics in dementia are complex. Stroke risk may be highest when used in patients presenting with psychosis without agitation, indicating the need for novel interventions for this group.","[""1 King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, De Crespigny Park, London, UK. christoph.mueller@kcl.ac.uk."", '2 South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK. christoph.mueller@kcl.ac.uk.', ""3 King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, De Crespigny Park, London, UK."", '4 Stavanger University Hospital, Centre for Age-Related Disease, Stavanger, Norway.', '5 University of Exeter Medical School, Exeter, UK.', '6 South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.']","Christoph Mueller, Christeena John, Gayan Perera, Dag Aarsland, Clive Ballard, Robert Stewart, ",European journal of epidemiology,2020,Antipsychotics; Dementia; Mortality; Prognosis; Risk stratification; Stroke.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32415541

1491,Identifying Diabetes in Clinical Notes in Hebrew: A Novel Text Classification Approach Based on Word Embedding,"NimbleMiner is a word embedding-based, language-agnostic natural language processing system for clinical text classification. Previously, NimbleMiner was applied in English and this study applied NimbleMiner on a large sample of inpatient clinical notes in Hebrew to identify instances of diabetes mellitus. The study data included 521,278 clinical notes (one admission and one discharge note per patient) for 268,664 hospital admissions to medical-surgical units of a large hospital in Israel. NimbleMiner achieved overall good performance (F-score =.94) when tested on a gold standard human annotated dataset of 800 clinical notes. We found 15% more patients with diabetes mentioned in the clinical notes compared with diagnoses data. Our findings about underreporting of diabetes in the coded diagnoses data highlight the urgent need for tools and algorithms that will help busy providers identify a range of useful information, like having a diabetes.","['1 School of Nursing & Data Science Institute, Columbia University, New York City, NY, USA.', '2 Visiting Nurse Service of New York, New York City, NY, USA.', '3 Cheryl Spencer Department of Nursing, University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel.', '4 Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.']","Maxim Topaz, Ludmila Murga, Chagai Grossman, Daniella Daliyot, Shlomit Jacobson, Noa Rozendorn, Eyal Zimlichman, Nadav Furie, ",Studies in health technology and informatics,2019,Diabetes; Natural language processing; Text classification.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31437952
1492,Improving Moderator Responsiveness in Online Peer Support Through Automated Triage,"Background:
      
    

    
      Online peer support forums require oversight to ensure they remain safe and therapeutic. As online communities grow, they place a greater burden on their human moderators, which increases the likelihood that people at risk may be overlooked. This study evaluated the potential for machine learning to assist online peer support by directing moderators' attention where it is most needed. Objective:
      
    

    
      This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of an automated triage system and the extent to which it influences moderator behavior. Methods:
      
    

    
      A machine learning classifier was trained to prioritize forum messages as green, amber, red, or crisis depending on how urgently they require attention from a moderator. This was then launched as a set of widgets injected into a popular online peer support forum hosted by ReachOut.com, an Australian Web-based youth mental health service that aims to intervene early in the onset of mental health problems in young people. The accuracy of the system was evaluated using a holdout test set of manually prioritized messages. The impact on moderator behavior was measured as response ratio and response latency, that is, the proportion of messages that receive at least one reply from a moderator and how long it took for these replies to be made. These measures were compared across 3 periods: before launch, after an informal launch, and after a formal launch accompanied by training. Results:
      
    

    
      The algorithm achieved 84% f-measure in identifying content that required a moderator response. Between prelaunch and post-training periods, response ratios increased by 0.9, 4.4, and 10.5 percentage points for messages labelled as crisis, red, and green, respectively, but decreased by 5.0 percentage points for amber messages. Logistic regression indicated that the triage system was a significant contributor to response ratios for green, amber, and red messages, but not for crisis messages. Response latency was significantly reduced (P<.001), between the same periods, by factors of 80%, 80%, 77%, and 12% for crisis, red, amber, and green messages, respectively. Regression analysis indicated that the triage system made a significant and unique contribution to reducing the time taken to respond to green, amber, and red messages, but not to crisis messages, after accounting for moderator and community activity. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The triage system was generally accurate, and moderators were largely in agreement with how messages were prioritized. It had a modest effect on response ratios, primarily because moderators were already more likely to respond to high priority content before the introduction of triage. However, it significantly and substantially reduced the time taken for moderators to respond to prioritized content. Further evaluations are needed to assess the impact of mistakes made by the triage algorithm and how changes to moderator responsiveness impact the well-being of forum members.","['1 School of Information, Systems and Modelling, Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, University of Technology, Sydney, Sydney, Australia.', '2 School of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.', '3 Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of California (Davis), Davis, CA, United States.', '4 Medical Investigation of Neurodevelopmental Disorders Institute, University of California (Davis), Davis, CA, United States.', '5 Dyson School of Design Engineering, Imperial College, London, United Kingdom.']","David N Milne, Kathryn L McCabe, Rafael A Calvo, ",Journal of medical Internet research,2019,classification; natural language processing; social support; triage.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31025945
1493,Automatic Detection of Hypoglycemic Events From the Electronic Health Record Notes of Diabetes Patients: Empirical Study,"Background:
      
    

    
      Hypoglycemic events are common and potentially dangerous conditions among patients being treated for diabetes. Automatic detection of such events could improve patient care and is valuable in population studies. Electronic health records (EHRs) are valuable resources for the detection of such events. Objective:
      
    

    
      In this study, we aim to develop a deep-learning-based natural language processing (NLP) system to automatically detect hypoglycemic events from EHR notes. Our model is called the High-Performing System for Automatically Detecting Hypoglycemic Events (HYPE). Methods:
      
    

    
      Domain experts reviewed 500 EHR notes of diabetes patients to determine whether each sentence contained a hypoglycemic event or not. We used this annotated corpus to train and evaluate HYPE, the high-performance NLP system for hypoglycemia detection. We built and evaluated both a classical machine learning model (ie, support vector machines [SVMs]) and state-of-the-art neural network models. Results:
      
    

    
      We found that neural network models outperformed the SVM model. The convolutional neural network (CNN) model yielded the highest performance in a 10-fold cross-validation setting: mean precision=0.96 (SD 0.03), mean recall=0.86 (SD 0.03), and mean F1=0.91 (SD 0.03). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Despite the challenges posed by small and highly imbalanced data, our CNN-based HYPE system still achieved a high performance for hypoglycemia detection. HYPE can be used for EHR-based hypoglycemia surveillance and population studies in diabetes patients.","['1 Department of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts Lowell, Lowell, MA, United States.', '2 Center for Healthcare Organization and Implementation Research, Bedford, MA, United States.', '3 Section of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, School of Medicine, Boston University, Boston, MA, United States.', '4 Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, United States.', '5 Department of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, MA, United States.']","Yonghao Jin, Fei Li, Varsha G Vimalananda, Hong Yu, ",JMIR medical informatics,2019,adverse events; convolutional neural networks; hypoglycemia; natural language processing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31702562

1495,Concept embedding to measure semantic relatedness for biomedical information ontologies,"There have been many attempts to identify relationships among concepts corresponding to terms from biomedical information ontologies such as the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). In particular, vector representation of such concepts using information from UMLS definition texts is widely used to measure the relatedness between two biological concepts. However, conventional relatedness measures have a limited range of applicable word coverage, which limits the performance of these models. In this paper, we propose a concept-embedding model of a UMLS semantic relatedness measure to overcome the limitations of earlier models. We obtained context texts of biological concepts that are not defined in UMLS by utilizing Wikipedia as an external knowledgebase. Concept vector representations were then derived from the context texts of the biological concepts. The degree of relatedness between two concepts was defined as the cosine similarity between corresponding concept vectors. As a result, we validated that our method provides higher coverage and better performance than the conventional method.","['1 Department of Bio and Brain Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, Republic of Korea.', '2 Milner Therapeutics Institute University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, UK.', '3 Department of Bio and Brain Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, Republic of Korea.

1496,Partially automated whole-genome sequencing reanalysis of previously undiagnosed pediatric patients can efficiently yield new diagnoses,"To investigate the diagnostic and clinical utility of a partially automated reanalysis pipeline, forty-eight cases of seriously ill children with suspected genetic disease who did not receive a diagnosis upon initial manual analysis of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) were reanalyzed at least 1 year later. Clinical natural language processing (CNLP) of medical records provided automated, updated patient phenotypes, and an automated analysis system delivered limited lists of possible diagnostic variants for each case. CNLP identified a median of 79 new clinical features per patient at least 1 year later. Compared to a standard manual reanalysis pipeline, the partially automated pipeline reduced the number of variants to be analyzed by 90% (range: 74%-96%). In 2 cases, diagnoses were made upon reinterpretation, representing an incremental diagnostic yield of 4.2% (2/48, 95% CI: 0.5-14.3%). Four additional cases were flagged with a possible diagnosis to be considered during subsequent reanalysis. Separately, copy number analysis led to diagnoses in two cases. Ongoing discovery of new disease genes and refined variant classification necessitate periodic reanalysis of negative WGS cases. The clinical features of patients sequenced as infants evolve rapidly with age. Partially automated reanalysis, including automated re-phenotyping through CNLP, has the potential to identify molecular diagnoses with reduced expert labor intensity.","[""1 Rady Children's Institute for Genomic Medicine, San Diego, CA USA."", '2 Diploid, Leuven, Belgium.']","Kiely N James, Michelle M Clark, Brandon Camp, Cyrielle Kint, Peter Schols, Sergey Batalov, Benjamin Briggs, Narayanan Veeraraghavan, Shimul Chowdhury, Stephen F Kingsmore, ",NPJ genomic medicine,2020,Genetic testing; Molecular medicine.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32821428

Currently, however, existing SDOH data collection methods are ad hoc and inadequate, and SDOH data are not systematically included in clinical research or used to inform patient care. Social contextual data are rarely captured prospectively in a structured and comprehensive manner, leaving large knowledge gaps. Extraction methods are now being developed to facilitate the collection, standardization, and integration of SDOH data into electronic health records. If successful, these efforts may have implications for health equity, such as reducing disparities in access and outcomes.

1498,Plant science decadal vision 2020-2030: Reimagining the potential of plants for a healthy and sustainable future,"Plants, and the biological systems around them, are key to the future health of the planet and its inhabitants. The Plant Science Decadal Vision 2020-2030 frames our ability to perform vital and far-reaching research in plant systems sciences, essential to how we value participants and apply emerging technologies. We outline a comprehensive vision for addressing some of our most pressing global problems through discovery, practical applications, and education. The Decadal Vision was developed by the participants at the Plant Summit 2019, a community event organized by the Plant Science Research Network. The Decadal Vision describes a holistic vision for the next decade of plant science that blends recommendations for research, people, and technology. Going beyond discoveries and applications, we, the plant science community, must implement bold, innovative changes to research cultures and training paradigms in this era of automation, virtualization, and the looming shadow of climate change. Our vision and hopes for the next decade are encapsulated in the phrase reimagining the potential of plants for a healthy and sustainable future. The Decadal Vision recognizes the vital intersection of human and scientific elements and demands an integrated implementation of strategies for research (Goals 1-4), people (Goals 5 and 6), and technology (Goals 7 and 8). This report is intended to help inspire and guide the research community, scientific societies, federal funding agencies, private philanthropies, corporations, educators, entrepreneurs, and early career researchers over the next 10 years. The research encompass experimental and computational approaches to understanding and predicting ecosystem behavior; novel production systems for food, feed, and fiber with greater crop diversity, efficiency, productivity, and resilience that improve ecosystem health; approaches to realize the potential for advances in nutrition, discovery and engineering of plant-based medicines, and ""green infrastructure."" Launching the Transparent Plant will use experimental and computational approaches to break down the phytobiome into a ""parts store"" that supports tinkering and supports query, prediction, and rapid-response problem solving. Equity, diversity, and inclusion are indispensable cornerstones of realizing our vision. We make recommendations around funding and systems that support customized professional development. Plant systems are frequently taken for granted therefore we make recommendations to improve plant awareness and community science programs to increase understanding of scientific research. We prioritize emerging technologies, focusing on non-invasive imaging, sensors, and plug-and-play portable lab technologies, coupled with enabling computational advances. Plant systems science will benefit from data management and future advances in automation, machine learning, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence-assisted data integration, pattern identification, and decision making. Implementation of this vision will transform plant systems science and ripple outwards through society and across the globe. Beyond deepening our biological understanding, we envision entirely new applications. We further anticipate a wave of diversification of plant systems practitioners while stimulating community engagement, underpinning increasing entrepreneurship. This surge of engagement and knowledge will help satisfy and stoke people's natural curiosity about the future, and their desire to prepare for it, as they seek fuller information about food, health, climate and ecological systems.","['1 American Society of Plant Biologists Rockville MD USA.', '2 University of Massachusetts Amherst Amherst MA USA.', '3 Washington State University Pullman WA USA.', '4 Michigan State University East Lansing MI USA.', '5 University of Wisconsin-Madison Madison WI USA.', '6 Arkansas State University State University Jonesboro AR USA.', '7 University of Arizona Tucson AZ USA.', ""8 Beck's Hybrids Noblesville IN USA."", '9 Texas A&M University College Station TX USA.', '10 Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research Ithaca NY USA.', '11 Cornell University Ithaca NY USA.', '12 Center for Genome Research and Biocomputing, and Department of Botany and Plant Pathology Oregon State University Corvallis Armenia.', '13 NC State University Raleigh NC USA.', '14 University of California Berkley CA USA.', '15 Duke University Durham NC USA.', '16 University of Missouri Columbia MO USA.', '17 Corteva Agriscience Johnston IA USA.', '18 Stetson University Deland FL USA.', '19 Yale New Haven CT USA.', '20 California State University Monterey Bay, Seaside CA USA.', '21 Oklahoma State University (emerita) Corrales NM USA.', '22 Oregon State University Corvallis OR USA.', '23 Bayer Crop Science Ballwin MO USA.', '24 Roger Williams University Bristol RI USA.', '25 Washington University in St Louis St Louis MO USA.', '26 American Farmland Trust St. Paul MN USA.', '27 University of Leeds Leeds United Kingdom.', '28 Boyce Thompson Institute, and Plant Biology Section Cornell University Ithaca NY USA.', '29 The Pennsylvania State University University Park USA.', '30 California Botanic Garden Claremont CA USA.', '31 Harvard University Seattle WA USA.', '32 University of Washington Seattle WA USA.', '33 University of Florida Apopka FL USA.', '34 Valent BioSciences LLC Libertyville IL USA.', '35 University of California Irvine CA USA.', '36 University of Kentucky Lexington KY USA.', '37 University of California Los Angeles CA USA.']","Natalie Henkhaus, Madelaine Bartlett, David Gang, Rebecca Grumet, Ingrid Jordon-Thaden, Argelia Lorence, Eric Lyons, Samantha Miller, Seth Murray, Andrew Nelson, Chelsea Specht, Brett Tyler, Thomas Wentworth, David Ackerly, David Baltensperger, Philip Benfey, James Birchler, Sreekala Chellamma, Roslyn Crowder, Michael Donoghue, Jose Pablo Dundore-Arias, Jacqueline Fletcher, Valerie Fraser, Kelly Gillespie, Lonnie Guralnick, Elizabeth Haswell, Mitchell Hunter, Shawn Kaeppler, Stefan Kepinski, Fay-Wei Li, Sally Mackenzie, Lucinda McDade, Ya Min, Jennifer Nemhauser, Brian Pearson, Peter Petracek, Katie Rogers, Ann Sakai, Delanie Sickler, Crispin Taylor, Laura Wayne, Ole Wendroth, Felipe Zapata, David Stern, ",Plant direct,2020,research areas; research methods; research organisms.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32904806

Cognitive decline and dementia are significant threats to independence and quality of life in older adults. Therefore, identifying interventions that help to maintain cognitive function in older adults or to reduce the risk of dementia is a research priority. Cognitive training uses repeated practice on standardised exercises targeting one or more cognitive domains and is intended to maintain optimum cognitive function. This review examines the effect of computerised cognitive training interventions lasting at least 12 weeks on the cognitive function of healthy adults aged 65 or older. Objectives:
      
    

    
      To evaluate the effects of computerised cognitive training interventions lasting at least 12 weeks for the maintenance or improvement of cognitive function in cognitively healthy people in late life. Search methods:
      
    

    
      We searched to 31 March 2018 in ALOIS (www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois) and performed additional searches of MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO Portal/ICTRP (www.apps.who.int/trialsearch) to ensure that the search was as comprehensive and as up-to-date as possible, to identify published, unpublished, and ongoing trials. Selection criteria:
      
    

    
      We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs, published or unpublished, reported in any language. Participants were cognitively healthy people, and at least 80% of the study population had to be aged 65 or older. Experimental interventions adhered to the following criteria: intervention was any form of interactive computerised cognitive intervention - including computer exercises, computer games, mobile devices, gaming console, and virtual reality - that involved repeated practice on standardised exercises of specified cognitive domain(s) for the purpose of enhancing cognitive function; duration of the intervention was at least 12 weeks; cognitive outcomes were measured; and cognitive training interventions were compared with active or inactive control interventions. Data collection and analysis:
      
    

    
      We performed preliminary screening of search results using a 'crowdsourcing' method to identify RCTs. At least two review authors working independently screened the remaining citations against inclusion criteria. At least two review authors also independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included RCTs. Where appropriate, we synthesised data in random-effect meta-analyses, comparing computerised cognitive training (CCT) separately with active and inactive controls. We expressed treatment effects as standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used GRADE methods to describe the overall quality of the evidence for each outcome. Main results:
      
    

    
      We identified eight RCTs with a total of 1183 participants. Researchers provided interventions over 12 to 26 weeks; in five trials, the duration of intervention was 12 or 13 weeks. The included studies had a moderate risk of bias. Review authors noted a lot of inconsistency between trial results. The overall quality of evidence was low or very low for all outcomes.We compared CCT first against active control interventions, such as watching educational videos. Because of the very low quality of the evidence, we were unable to determine any effect of CCT on our primary outcome of global cognitive function or on secondary outcomes of episodic memory, speed of processing, executive function, and working memory.We also compared CCT versus inactive control (no interventions). Negative SMDs favour CCT over control. We found no studies on our primary outcome of global cognitive function. In terms of our secondary outcomes, trial results suggest slight improvement in episodic memory (mean difference (MD) -0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.73 to -0.07; 150 participants; 1 study; low-quality evidence) and no effect on executive function (SMD -0.08, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.15; 292 participants; 2 studies; low-quality evidence), working memory (MD -0.08, 95% CI -0.43 to 0.27; 60 participants; 1 study; low-quality evidence), or verbal fluency (MD -0.11, 95% CI -1.58 to 1.36; 150 participants; 1 study; low-quality evidence). We could not determine any effects on speed of processing at trial endpoints because the evidence was of very low quality.We found no evidence on quality of life, activities of daily living, or adverse effects in either comparison. Authors' conclusions:
      
    

    
      We found little evidence from the included studies to suggest that 12 or more weeks of CCT improves cognition in healthy older adults. However, our limited confidence in the results reflects the overall quality of the evidence. Inconsistency between trials was a major limitation. In five of the eight trials, the duration of intervention was just three months. The possibility that longer periods of training could be beneficial remains to be more fully explored.","['1 Centre for Healthy Brain Ageing (CHeBA), University of New South Wales, Suite 407 185 Elizabeth Street, Sydney, NSW, Australia, 2000.']","Nicola J Gates, Anne Ws Rutjes, Marcello Di Nisio, Salman Karim, Lee-Yee Chong, Evrim March, Gabriel Martínez, Robin Wm Vernooij, ",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30864187

1501,Neural sentence embedding models for semantic similarity estimation in the biomedical domain,"Background:
      
    

    
      Neural network based embedding models are receiving significant attention in the field of natural language processing due to their capability to effectively capture semantic information representing words, sentences or even larger text elements in low-dimensional vector space. While current state-of-the-art models for assessing the semantic similarity of textual statements from biomedical publications depend on the availability of laboriously curated ontologies, unsupervised neural embedding models only require large text corpora as input and do not need manual curation. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of current state-of-the-art neural sentence embedding models for semantic similarity estimation of sentences from biomedical literature. We trained different neural embedding models on 1.7 million articles from the PubMed Open Access dataset, and evaluated them based on a biomedical benchmark set containing 100 sentence pairs annotated by human experts and a smaller contradiction subset derived from the original benchmark set. Results:
      
    

    
      Experimental results showed that, with a Pearson correlation of 0.819, our best unsupervised model based on the Paragraph Vector Distributed Memory algorithm outperforms previous state-of-the-art results achieved on the BIOSSES biomedical benchmark set. Moreover, our proposed supervised model that combines different string-based similarity metrics with a neural embedding model surpasses previous ontology-dependent supervised state-of-the-art approaches in terms of Pearson's r (r = 0.871) on the biomedical benchmark set. In contrast to the promising results for the original benchmark, we found our best models' performance on the smaller contradiction subset to be poor. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      In this study, we have highlighted the value of neural network-based models for semantic similarity estimation in the biomedical domain by showing that they can keep up with and even surpass previous state-of-the-art approaches for semantic similarity estimation that depend on the availability of laboriously curated ontologies, when evaluated on a biomedical benchmark set. Capturing contradictions and negations in biomedical sentences, however, emerged as an essential area for further work.","['1 Section for Artificial Intelligence and Decision Support, Center for Medical Statistics, Informatics, and Intelligent Systems, Medical University of Vienna, Währinger Straße 25a, 1090, Vienna, Austria.', '2 Section for Artificial Intelligence and Decision Support, Center for Medical Statistics, Informatics, and Intelligent Systems, Medical University of Vienna, Währinger Straße 25a, 1090, Vienna, Austria. matthias.samwald@meduniwien.ac.at.']","Kathrin Blagec, Hong Xu, Asan Agibetov, Matthias Samwald, ",BMC bioinformatics,2019,Natural language processing; Neural embedding models; Semantics.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30975071
1502,GWAS and enrichment analyses of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease identify new trait-associated genes and pathways across eMERGE Network,"Background:
      
    

    
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common chronic liver illness with a genetically heterogeneous background that can be accompanied by considerable morbidity and attendant health care costs. The pathogenesis and progression of NAFLD is complex with many unanswered questions. We conducted genome-wide association studies (GWASs) using both adult and pediatric participants from the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network to identify novel genetic contributors to this condition. Methods:
      
    

    
      First, a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm was developed, tested, and deployed at each site to identify 1106 NAFLD cases and 8571 controls and histological data from liver tissue in 235 available participants. These include 1242 pediatric participants (396 cases, 846 controls). The algorithm included billing codes, text queries, laboratory values, and medication records. Next, GWASs were performed on NAFLD cases and controls and case-only analyses using histologic scores and liver function tests adjusting for age, sex, site, ancestry, PC, and body mass index (BMI). Results:
      
    

    
      Consistent with previous results, a robust association was detected for the PNPLA3 gene cluster in participants with European ancestry. At the PNPLA3-SAMM50 region, three SNPs, rs738409, rs738408, and rs3747207, showed strongest association (best SNP rs738409 p = 1.70 × 10- 20). This effect was consistent in both pediatric (p = 9.92 × 10- 6) and adult (p = 9.73 × 10- 15) cohorts. Additionally, this variant was also associated with disease severity and NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) (p = 3.94 × 10- 8, beta = 0.85). PheWAS analysis link this locus to a spectrum of liver diseases beyond NAFLD with a novel negative correlation with gout (p = 1.09 × 10- 4). We also identified novel loci for NAFLD disease severity, including one novel locus for NAS score near IL17RA (rs5748926, p = 3.80 × 10- 8), and another near ZFP90-CDH1 for fibrosis (rs698718, p = 2.74 × 10- 11). Post-GWAS and gene-based analyses identified more than 300 genes that were used for functional and pathway enrichment analyses. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      In summary, this study demonstrates clear confirmation of a previously described NAFLD risk locus and several novel associations. Further collaborative studies including an ethnically diverse population with well-characterized liver histologic features of NAFLD are needed to further validate the novel findings.","[""1 Center for Autoimmune Genomics and Etiology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), Cincinnati, OH, USA. bahram.namjou@cchmc.org."", '2 College of Medicine, University of Cincinnati, 3333 Burnet Avenue, Cincinnati, OH, 45229, USA. bahram.namjou@cchmc.org.', '3 College of Medicine, University of Cincinnati, 3333 Burnet Avenue, Cincinnati, OH, 45229, USA.', ""4 Division of Biomedical Informatics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", ""5 Center for Autoimmune Genomics and Etiology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), Cincinnati, OH, USA."", '6 Department of Biomedical Informatics Medical Education, School of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', ""7 Center for Applied Genomics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Bethesda, MD, USA."", '8 Research IS and Computing, Partners HealthCare, Harvard University, Somerville, MA, USA.', '9 Departments of Biomedical Informatics and Medicine, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA.', '10 Center for Genetic Medicine, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', ""11 Division of Immunobiology, Department of Pediatrics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Research Foundation and the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", '12 Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute (Formerly Group Health Cooperative-Seattle), Kaiser Permanente, Seattle, WA, USA.', '13 Department of Molecular and Functional Genomics, Geisinger, Danville, PA, USA.', '14 Department of Genetics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', '15 Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York City, NY, USA.', '16 Research Information Science and Computing, Partners HealthCare, Boston, MA, USA.', '17 Genomic Medicine Institute (M.S.W.), Geisinger, Danville, PA, USA.', '18 Departments of Medicine (Medical Genetics) and Genome Sciences, University of Washington Medical Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', '19 Department of Cardiovascular Diseases, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', '20 Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', '21 National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', ""22 Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Department of Pediatrics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, University of Cincinnati School of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", '23 U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA.']","Bahram Namjou, Todd Lingren, Yongbo Huang, Sreeja Parameswaran, Beth L Cobb, Ian B Stanaway, John J Connolly, Frank D Mentch, Barbara Benoit, Xinnan Niu, Wei-Qi Wei, Robert J Carroll, Jennifer A Pacheco, Isaac T W Harley, Senad Divanovic, David S Carrell, Eric B Larson, David J Carey, Shefali Verma, Marylyn D Ritchie, Ali G Gharavi, Shawn Murphy, Marc S Williams, David R Crosslin, Gail P Jarvik, Iftikhar J Kullo, Hakon Hakonarson, Rongling Li, eMERGE Network, Stavra A Xanthakos, John B Harley, ",BMC medicine,2019,Fatty liver; GWAS; Genetic polymorphism; NAFLD; PheWAS; Polygenic risk score.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31311600
1503,Determinants of cognitive performance and decline in 20 diverse ethno-regional groups: A COSMIC collaboration cohort study,"Background:
      
    

    
      With no effective treatments for cognitive decline or dementia, improving the evidence base for modifiable risk factors is a research priority. This study investigated associations between risk factors and late-life cognitive decline on a global scale, including comparisons between ethno-regional groups. Methods and findings:
      
    

    
      We harmonized longitudinal data from 20 population-based cohorts from 15 countries over 5 continents, including 48,522 individuals (58.4% women) aged 54-105 (mean = 72.7) years and without dementia at baseline. Studies had 2-15 years of follow-up. The risk factors investigated were age, sex, education, alcohol consumption, anxiety, apolipoprotein E ε4 allele (APOE*4) status, atrial fibrillation, blood pressure and pulse pressure, body mass index, cardiovascular disease, depression, diabetes, self-rated health, high cholesterol, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, physical activity, smoking, and history of stroke. Associations with risk factors were determined for a global cognitive composite outcome (memory, language, processing speed, and executive functioning tests) and Mini-Mental State Examination score. Individual participant data meta-analyses of multivariable linear mixed model results pooled across cohorts revealed that for at least 1 cognitive outcome, age (B = -0.1, SE = 0.01), APOE*4 carriage (B = -0.31, SE = 0.11), depression (B = -0.11, SE = 0.06), diabetes (B = -0.23, SE = 0.10), current smoking (B = -0.20, SE = 0.08), and history of stroke (B = -0.22, SE = 0.09) were independently associated with poorer cognitive performance (p < 0.05 for all), and higher levels of education (B = 0.12, SE = 0.02) and vigorous physical activity (B = 0.17, SE = 0.06) were associated with better performance (p < 0.01 for both). Age (B = -0.07, SE = 0.01), APOE*4 carriage (B = -0.41, SE = 0.18), and diabetes (B = -0.18, SE = 0.10) were independently associated with faster cognitive decline (p < 0.05 for all). Different effects between Asian people and white people included stronger associations for Asian people between ever smoking and poorer cognition (group by risk factor interaction: B = -0.24, SE = 0.12), and between diabetes and cognitive decline (B = -0.66, SE = 0.27; p < 0.05 for both). Limitations of our study include a loss or distortion of risk factor data with harmonization, and not investigating factors at midlife. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      These results suggest that education, smoking, physical activity, diabetes, and stroke are all modifiable factors associated with cognitive decline. If these factors are determined to be causal, controlling them could minimize worldwide levels of cognitive decline. However, any global prevention strategy may need to consider ethno-regional differences.","['1 Centre for Healthy Brain Ageing, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', '2 Instituto René Rachou, Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', '3 Departamento de Psiquiatria, Universidade Federal de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.', '4 Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Cambridge University, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', '5 Institute of Health and Society, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom.', '6 Finlay-Albarrán Faculty of Medical Sciences, Medical University of Havana, Havana, Cuba.', '7 Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Havana, Cuba.', '8 Memory and Aging Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America.', '9 Medical University of Matanzas, Matanzas, Cuba.', '10 Saul R.

1504,Assessing the enrichment of dietary supplement coverage in the Unified Medical Language System,"Objective:
      
    

    
      We sought to assess the need for additional coverage of dietary supplements (DS) in the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) by investigating (1) the overlap between the integrated DIetary Supplements Knowledge base (iDISK) DS ingredient terminology and the UMLS and (2) the coverage of iDISK and the UMLS over DS mentions in the biomedical literature. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      We estimated the overlap between iDISK and the UMLS by mapping iDISK to the UMLS using exact and normalized strings. The coverage of iDISK and the UMLS over DS mentions in the biomedical literature was evaluated via a DS named-entity recognition (NER) task within PubMed abstracts. Results:
      
    

    
      The coverage analysis revealed that only 30% of iDISK terms can be matched to the UMLS, although these cover over 99% of iDISK concepts. A manual review revealed that a majority of the unmatched terms represented new synonyms, rather than lexical variants. For NER, iDISK nearly doubles the precision and achieves a higher F1 score than the UMLS, while maintaining a competitive recall. Discussion:
      
    

    
      While iDISK has significant concept overlap with the UMLS, it contains many novel synonyms. Furthermore, almost 3000 of these overlapping UMLS concepts are missing a DS designation, which could be provided by iDISK. The NER experiments show that the specialization of iDISK is useful for identifying DS mentions. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our results show that the DS representation in the UMLS could be enriched by adding DS designations to many concepts and by adding new synonyms.","['1 Institute for Health Informatics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', '2 Department of Pharmaceutical Care and Health Systems, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', '3 Department of Experimental and Clinical Pharmacy, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', '4 Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications, National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.']","Jake Vasilakes, Anusha Bompelli, Jeffrey R Bishop, Terrence J Adam, Olivier Bodenreider, Rui Zhang, ",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2020,"dietary supplements; named entity recognition, natural language processing; terminology; unified medical language system.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32940692
1505,Part of Speech Production in Patients With Primary Progressive Aphasia: An Analysis Based on Natural Language Processing,"Background Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a progressive decline of language functions. Its symptoms are grouped into three PPA variants: nonfluent PPA, logopenic PPA, and semantic PPA. Grammatical deficiencies differ depending on the PPA variant. Aims This study aims to determine the differences between PPA variants with respect to part of speech (POS) production and to identify morphological markers that classify PPA variants using machine learning. By fulfilling these aims, the overarching goal is to provide objective measures that can facilitate clinical diagnosis, evaluation, and prognosis. Method and Procedure Connected speech productions from PPA patients produced in a picture description task were transcribed, and the POS class of each word was estimated using natural language processing, namely, POS tagging. We then implemented a twofold analysis: (a) linear regression to determine how patients with nonfluent PPA, semantic PPA, and logopenic PPA variants differ in their POS productions and (b) a supervised classification analysis based on POS using machine learning models (i.e., random forests, decision trees, and support vector machines) to subtype PPA variants and generate feature importance (FI). Outcome and Results Using an automated analysis of a short picture description task, this study showed that content versus function words can distinguish patients with nonfluent PPA, semantic PPA, and logopenic PPA variants. Verbs were less important as distinguishing features of patients with different PPA variants than earlier thought. Finally, the study showed that among the most important distinguishing features of PPA variants were elaborative speech elements, such as adjectives and adverbs.","['1 Department of Neurology, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.', '2 Department of Otolaryngology, Johns Hopkins Medicine, Baltimore MD.', '3 Department of Cognitive Science, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore MD.']","Charalambos Themistocleous, Kimberly Webster, Alexandros Afthinos, Kyrana Tsapkini, ",American journal of speech-language pathology,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32697669

1507,Medical Information Extraction in the Age of Deep Learning,"Objectives:
      
    

    
      We survey recent developments in medical Information Extraction (IE) as reported in the literature from the past three years. Our focus is on the fundamental methodological paradigm shift from standard Machine Learning (ML) techniques to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). We describe applications of this new paradigm concentrating on two basic IE tasks, named entity recognition and relation extraction, for two selected semantic classes-diseases and drugs (or medications)-and relations between them. Methods:
      
    

    
      For the time period from 2017 to early 2020, we searched for relevant publications from three major scientific communities: medicine and medical informatics, natural language processing, as well as neural networks and artificial intelligence. Results:
      
    

    
      In the past decade, the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has undergone a profound methodological shift from symbolic to distributed representations based on the paradigm of Deep Learning (DL). Meanwhile, this trend is, although with some delay, also reflected in the medical NLP community. In the reporting period, overwhelming experimental evidence has been gathered, as illustrated in this survey for medical IE, that DL-based approaches outperform non-DL ones by often large margins. Still, small-sized and access-limited corpora create intrinsic problems for data-greedy DL as do special linguistic phenomena of medical sublanguages that have to be overcome by adaptive learning strategies. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The paradigm shift from (feature-engineered) ML to DNNs changes the fundamental methodological rules of the game for medical NLP. This change is by no means restricted to medical IE but should also deeply influence other areas of medical informatics, either NLP- or non-NLP-based.","['1 Jena University Language & Information Engineering (JULIE) Lab, Friedrich-Schiller-Universität Jena, Jena, Germany.', '2 Institute for Medical Informatics, Statistics and Documentation, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.']","Udo Hahn, Michel Oleynik, ",Yearbook of medical informatics,2020 Aug,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32823318
1508,Image Hallucination From Attribute Pairs,"Recent image-generation methods have demonstrated that realistic images can be produced from captions. Despite the promising results achieved, existing caption-based generation methods confront a dilemma. On the one hand, the image generator should be provided with sufficient details for realistic hallucination, meaning that longer sentences with rich content are preferred, but on the other hand, the generator is meanwhile fragile to long sentences due to their complex semantics and syntax like long-range dependencies and the combinatorial explosion of object visual features. Toward alleviating this dilemma, a novel approach is proposed in this article to hallucinate images from attribute pairs, which can be extracted from natural language processing (NLP) toolsets in the presence of complex semantics and syntax. Attribute pairs, therefore, enable our image generator to tackle long sentences handily and alleviate the combinatorial explosion, and at the same time, allow us to enlarge the training dataset and to produce hallucinations from randomly combined attribute pairs at ease. Experiments on widely used datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach yields results superior to the state of the art.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Fuxiang Wu, Jun Cheng, Xinchao Wang, Lei Wang, Dapeng Tao, ",IEEE transactions on cybernetics,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32275630
1509,CoMNRank: An integrated approach to extract and prioritize human microbial metabolites from MEDLINE records,"Motivation:
      
    

    
      Trillions of bacteria in human body (human microbiota) affect human health and diseases by controlling host functions through small molecule metabolites.An accurate and comprehensive catalog of the metabolic output from human microbiota is critical for our deep understanding of how microbial metabolism contributes to human health.The large number of published biomedical research articles is a rich resource of microbiome studies.However, automatically extracting microbial metabolites from free-text documents and differentiating them from other human metabolites is a challenging task.Here we developed an integrated approach called Co-occurrence Metabolite Network Ranking (CoMNRank) by combining named entity extraction, network construction and topic sensitive network-based prioritization to extract and prioritize microbial metabolites from biomedical articles. Methods:
      
    

    
      The text data included 28,851,232 MEDLINE records.CoMNRank consists of three steps: (1) extraction of human metabolites from MEDLINE records; (2) construction of a weighted co-occurrence metabolite network (CoMN); (3) prioritization and differentiation of microbial metabolites from other human metabolites. Results:
      
    

    
      For the first step of CoMNRank, we extracted 11,846 human metabolites from MEDLINE articles, with a baseline performance of precision of 0.014, recall of 0.959 and F1 of 0.028.We then constructed a weighted CoMN of 6,996 nodes and 986,186 edges.CoMNRank effectively prioritized microbial metabolites: the precision of top ranked metabolites is 0.45, a 31-fold enrichment as compared to the overall precision of 0.014.Manual curation of top 100 metabolites showed a true precision of 0.67, among which 48% true positives are not captured by existing databases. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Our study sets the foundation for future tasks of microbial entity and relationship extractions as well as data-driven studies of how microbial metabolism contributes to human health and diseases.","['1 Center for Artificial Intelligence in Drug Discovery, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH 44106, United States.', '2 Center for Artificial Intelligence in Drug Discovery, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH 44106, United States.

1510,A computational ecosystem to support eHealth Knowledge Discovery technologies in Spanish,"The massive amount of biomedical information published online requires the development of automatic knowledge discovery technologies to effectively make use of this available content. To foster and support this, the research community creates linguistic resources, such as annotated corpora, and designs shared evaluation campaigns and academic competitive challenges. This work describes an ecosystem that facilitates research and development in knowledge discovery in the biomedical domain, specifically in Spanish language. To this end, several resources are developed and shared with the research community, including a novel semantic annotation model, an annotated corpus of 1045 sentences, and computational resources to build and evaluate automatic knowledge discovery techniques. Furthermore, a research task is defined with objective evaluation criteria, and an online evaluation environment is setup and maintained, enabling researchers interested in this task to obtain immediate feedback and compare their results with the state-of-the-art. As a case study, we analyze the results of a competitive challenge based on these resources and provide guidelines for future research. The constructed ecosystem provides an effective learning and evaluation environment to encourage research in knowledge discovery in Spanish biomedical documents.","['1 Faculty of Math and Computer Science, University of Habana, La Habana 10200, Cuba.

1511,Analysing Sentiment and Topics Related to Multiple Sclerosis on Twitter,"Background and objective:
      
    

    
      Social media could be valuable tools to support people with multiple sclerosis (MS). There is little evidence on the MS-related topics that are discussed on social media, and the sentiment linked to these topics. The objective of this work is to identify the MS-related main topics discussed on Twitter, and the sentiment linked to them. Methods:
      
    

    
      Tweets dealing with MS in the English language were extracted. Latent-Dirilecht Allocation (LDA) was used to identify the main topics discussed in these tweets. Iterative inductive process was used to group the tweets into recurrent topics. The sentiment analysis of these tweets was performed using SentiStrength. Results:
      
    

    
      LDA' identified topics were grouped into 4 categories, tweets dealing with: related chronic conditions; condition burden; disease-modifying drugs; and awareness-raising. Tweets on condition burden and related chronic conditions were the most negative (p<0.001). A significant lower positive sentiment was found for both tweets dealing with disease-modifying drugs, condition burden, and related chronic conditions (p<0.001). Only tweets on awareness-raising were most positive than the average (p<0.001). Discussion:
      
    

    
      The use of both tools to identify the main discussed topics on social media and to analyse the sentiment of these topics, increases the knowledge of the themes that could represent the bigger burden for persons affected with MS. This knowledge can help to improve support and therapeutic approaches addressed to them.","['1 University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland.', '2 Universidad de Sevilla, Seville, Spain.', '3 Norwegian Centre for E-health Research, University Hospital North Norway, Tromsø, Norway.']","Guido Giunti, Maëlick Claes, Enrique Dorronzoro Zubiete, Octavio Rivera-Romero, Elia Gabarron, ",Studies in health technology and informatics,2020,Multiple sclerosis; Twitter; natural language processing; sentiment analysis; topic modelling.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32570514
1512,CCMapper: An adaptive NLP-based free-text chief complaint mapping algorithm,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Chief complaint (CC) is among the earliest health information recorded at the beginning of a patient's visit to an emergency department (ED). We propose a heuristic methodology for automatically mapping the free-text data into a structured list of CCs. Methods:
      
    

    
      A comprehensive structured list categorizing CCs was developed by experienced Emergency Medicine (EM) physicians. Using this list, we developed a natural language processing-based algorithm, referred to as Chief Complaint Mapper (CCMapper), for automatically mapping a CC into the most appropriate category (ies). We trained and validated CCMapper using free-text CC data from the Mayo Clinic ED in Rochester, MN. We developed a consensus-based validation approach to handle both indifferences and disagreements between the two EM physicians who manually mapped a random sample of free-text CCs into categories within the structured list. Results:
      
    

    
      The kappa statistic demonstrated a high level of agreement (κ = 0.958) between the two physicians with less than 2% human error. CCMapper achieved a total sensitivity of 94.2% with a specificity of 99.8% and F-score of 94.7% on the validation set. The sensitivity of CCMapper when mapping free-text data with multiple CCs was 82.3% with a specificity of 99.1% and total F-score of 82.3%. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Due to its simplicity, high performance, and capability of incorporating new free-text CC data, CCMapper can be readily adopted by other EDs to support clinical decision making. CCMapper can facilitate the development of predictive models for the type and timing of important events in ED (e.g., ICU admission).","['1 Department of Health Informatics and Data Science, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, IL, USA; Center for Health Outcomes and Informatics Research, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, IL, USA.

And how to extract these information from EMRs has become a hot research topic. In this paper, we propose an ELMo-ET-CRF model based approach to extract medical named entity from Chinese electronic medical records (CEMRs). Firstly, a domain-specific ELMo model is fine-tuned on a common ELMo model with 4679 raw CEMRs. Then we use the encoder from Transformer (ET) as our model's encoder to alleviate the long context dependency problem, and the CRF is utilized as the decoder. At last, we compare the BiLSTM-CRF and ET-CRF model with word2vec and ELMo embeddings to CEMRs respectively to validate the effectiveness of ELMo-ET-CRF model. With the same training data and test data, the ELMo-ET-CRF outperforms all the other mentioned model architectures in this paper with 85.59% F1-score, which indicates the effectiveness of the proposed model architecture, and the performance is also competitive on the CCKS2019 leaderboard.","['1 Science and Technology on Parallel and Distributed Processing Laboratory, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha 410073, China.', '2 Laboratory of Software Engineering for Complex Systems, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha 410073, China.', '3 College of Computer, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha 410073, China.']","Qian Wan, Jie Liu, Luo Na Wei, Bin Ji, ",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,2020,Chinese electronic medical records; ELMo; named entity recognition; natural language processing; self-attention.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32987540
1514,The CLASSE GATOR (CLinical Acronym SenSE disambiGuATOR): A Method for predicting acronym sense from neonatal clinical notes,"Objective:
      
    

    
      To develop an algorithm for identifying acronym 'sense' from clinical notes without requiring a clinically annotated training set. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      Our algorithm is called CLASSE GATOR: Clinical Acronym SenSE disambiGuATOR. CLASSE GATOR extracts acronyms and definitions from PubMed Central (PMC). A logistic regression model is trained using words associated with specific acronym-definition pairs from PMC. CLASSE GATOR uses this library of acronym-definitions and their corresponding word feature vectors to predict the acronym 'sense' from Beth Israel Deaconess (MIMIC-III) neonatal notes. Results:
      
    

    
      We identified 1,257 acronyms and 8,287 definitions including a random definition from 31,764 PMC articles on prenatal exposures and 2,227,674 PMC open access articles. The average number of senses (definitions) per acronym was 6.6 (min = 2, max = 50). The average internal 5-fold cross validation was 87.9 % (on PMC). We found 727 unique acronyms (57.29 %) from PMC were present in 105,044 neonatal notes (MIMIC-III). We evaluated the performance of acronym prediction using 245 manually annotated clinical notes with 9 distinct acronyms. CLASSE GATOR achieved an overall accuracy of 63.04 % and outperformed random for 8/9 acronyms (88.89 %) when applied to clinical notes. We also compared our algorithm with UMN's acronym set, and found that CLASSE GATOR outperformed random for 63.46 % of 52 acronyms when using logistic regression, 75.00 % when using Bert and 76.92 % when using BioBert as the prediction algorithm within CLASSE GATOR. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      CLASSE GATOR is the first automated acronym sense disambiguation method for clinical notes. Importantly, CLASSE GATOR does not require an expensive manually annotated acronym-definition corpus for training.","['1 Department of Computer Science, University of Pennsylvania, United States.', ""2 Department of Pediatrics, Division of Neonatology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, United States; Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, United States."", ""3 Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, United States; Institute for Biomedical Informatics, University of Pennsylvania, United States; Center for Excellence in Environmental Toxicology, University of Pennsylvania, United States; Department of Biomedical and Health Informatics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, United States.

      Accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) to tumors is related to cancer prognosis. We investigated the contribution of host stromal microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) to the accumulation of MDSCs in metastasized lungs of prostate cancer in mice. Material and methods:
      
    

    
      Eight-week-old male C57Bl/6 wild type (WT) mice and mPGES-1 knock out mice (mPGES-1KO) were injected with RM9 murine prostate cancer cell line (5 × 106 cells/mL). Lung metastasis was evaluated by the number of colonies, the weight of the lung, and the number of MDSCs (CD11b+Gr1+ cells) in the lung. Results:
      
    

    
      Intravenous injections of RM9, a murine prostate cancer cell line to WT mice revealed that lung metastasis and accumulation of MDCSs were suppressed with treatments with a Gr1 antibody, a COX-2 inhibitor, and an mPGES-1 inhibitor. Lung metastasis and accumulation of CD11b+Gr1+MDSCs were suppressed in mPGES-1KO mice. The mRNA level of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) in the lung and the number of accumulated SDF-1-expressing CD11b+Gr1+ MDSCs were elevated at an early stage in lung metastasis of C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4)-expressing RM9 in an mPGES-1-dependent manner. The number of CXCR4-expressing CD11b+Gr1+MDSCs in WT mice was higher than that in mPGES-1KO mice. RM9 lung metastasis and accumulation of CD11b+Gr1+MDSCs were suppressed by CXCR4 antibody in WT mice but not in mPGES-1KO. WT mice transplanted with mPGES-1 KO bone marrow (BM) showed a significant reduction in lung metastasis and accumulation of CD11b+Gr1+MDSCs. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      These results suggest that mPGES-1 enhances tumor metastasis by inducing accumulation of BM-derived MDSCs. Selective mPGES-1 inhibitors might, therefore, represent valuable therapeutic tools for the suppression of tumor metastasis.","['1 Department of Pharmacology, Kitasato University School of Medicine, Japan; Department of Molecular Pharmacology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kitasato University, Japan; Medical Corporation Shibaakamonkai, Tochigi, Japan.', '2 Department of Pharmacology, Kitasato University School of Medicine, Japan; Department of Molecular Pharmacology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kitasato University, Japan.', '3 Department of Immunology, Japan.', '4 Department of Urology, Kitasato University School of Medicine, Japan.', '5 Department of Microbiology, Kitasato University School of Allied Health Science, Kanagawa, Japan.', '6 Division of Innate immune regulation, International Research and Development Center for Mucosal Vaccine, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Mucosal Immunology, School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', '7 Department of Medicine, Rheumatology Unit, Karolinska University Hospital, Karolinska Institutet, S-171 76, Stockholm, Sweden.', '8 Laboratory of Host Defense, WPI Immunology Frontier Research Center (IFReC), Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.', '9 Department of Pharmacology, Kitasato University School of Medicine, Japan; Department of Molecular Pharmacology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kitasato University, Japan.

1516,Can donor narratives yield insights? A natural language processing proof of concept to facilitate kidney allocation,"Although expedited placement could ameliorate stagnant kidney utilization, precisely identifying difficult-to-place organs is crucial to mitigate potential harms associated with this policy. Existing algorithms have only leveraged structured data from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN); however, detailed, free text case information about a donor exists. No known research exists about the utility of these data. We developed a model to predict the probability of delay or discard for adult deceased kidney donors between 2010 and 2018, leveraging donor free text data. The resultant model had a c-statistic of 0.75 compared to 0.80 ( Reduced Probability of Delay or Discard [model], r-PODD) and 0.77 ( Kidney Donor Profile Index, KDPI) on the test dataset. Analysis of the top predictive words suggest both known and potentially novel clinical factors (ie, a known factor such as hypertension vs a novel factor such as stents), and nuanced social factors (intravenous drug use) could negatively affect kidney utilization. These findings suggest that donor narratives have utility; the natural language processing (NLP) model is only moderately correlated with existing indices and provides directional evidence about additional cardiovascular risk factors that may affect kidney utilization. More research is needed to understand the potential to enhance existing indices of kidney utilization to better enable and mitigate the effects of policy interventions such as expedited placement.","['1 Research Department, United Network for Organ Sharing, Richmond, Virginia.', '2 Office of the Chief Medical Officer, United Network for Organ Sharing, Richmond, Virginia.']","Andrew M Placona, Carlos Martinez, Harrison McGehee, Bob Carrico, David K Klassen, Darren Stewart, ",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,2020 Apr,health services and outcomes research; kidney transplantation/nephrology; organ allocation; organ procurement and allocation; statistics.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31736193

However, the severe side effects and relatively poor prognosis limit their therapeutic effect. Therefore, developing novel platinum derivative and treatment strategy are critical for current lung cancer therapy. Methods: Flow cytometry, HMGB1 and ATP release, and immunoblotting were performed to evaluate the Oxaliplatin-induced immunogenic cell death (ICD) in two lung carcinoma cells. Vaccination approach and subcutaneous tumor models were created to analyze the tumor regression effect of Oxaliplatin. PD-L1 mRNA and protein levels were detected in LLC (Lewis lung carcinoma). Enhanced therapeutic efficacy of LLC was assessed by co-administration Oxaliplatin and aPD-L1 in murine lung tumor model. Results: Oxaliplatin induced robust ICD in LLC cells, activated dendritic cells (DCs, CD80+CD86+) and enhanced cytotoxic T cells (CD8+) in LLC tumor tissues, which resulted in tumor regression. Co-administration of Oxaliplatin and checkpoint inhibitor, aPD-L1, could enhance the therapeutic efficacy of LLC in murine lung carcinoma. Conclusion: This study reveals Oxaliplatin can induce robust ICD in tumor tissues and suppress tumor growth by activating DCs and enhancing T-cell infiltration. Notably, the Oxaliplatin-induced ICD provides an immunogenic microenvironment, which enhances the checkpoint inhibitor therapeutic efficacy of LLC.","['1 The Second Clinical Medical College of North Sichuan Medical College , Sichuan , China.', '2 Suining Central Hospital , Sichuan , China.']","Fengfei Sun, Lijuan Cui, Tingting Li, Silin Chen, Junmei Song, Dezhi Li, ",Journal of receptor and signal transduction research,2019 Jun,Lewis lung carcinoma; Oxaliplatin; checkpoint inhibitor; immunogenic cells death; tumor regression.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31441696

1519,Leptin induces immunosenescence in human B cells,"Leptin is an adipokine secreted primarily by the adipocytes. Leptin has endocrine and immune functions and increases the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by immune cells. Here we show that incubation of B cells from young lean individuals with leptin increases the frequencies of pro-inflammatory B cells and induces intrinsic B cell inflammation, characterized by mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6), chemokines (IL-8), micro-RNAs (miR-155 and miR-16), TLR4 and p16, a cell cycle regulator associated with immunosenescence. We have previously shown that the expression of these pro-inflammatory markers in unstimulated B cells is negatively associated with the response of the same B cells after in vivo or in vitro stimulation. B cells from young lean individuals, after in vitro incubation with leptin, show reduced class switch and influenza vaccine-specific IgG production. Our results altogether show that leptin makes B cells from youn lean individuals similar to those from young obese and elderly lean individuals, suggesting that leptin may be a mechanisms of immunosenescence in human B cells.","['1 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL, USA.

1520,Discovering nuclear targeting signal sequence through protein language learning and multivariate analysis,"Nuclear localization signals (NLSs) are peptides that target proteins to the nucleus by binding to carrier proteins in the cytoplasm that transport their cargo across the nuclear membrane. Accurate identification of NLSs can help elucidate the functions of nuclear protein complexes. The currently known NLS predictors are usually specific to certain species or largely dependent on prior knowledge of NLS basic residues. Thus, a more general predictor is highly desired to reduce the potentially high false positives or false negatives in discovering new NLSs. Here, we report a new method, INSP (Identification Nucleus Signal Peptide), to effectively identify NLS mainly based on statistical knowledge and machine learning algorithms. In our NLS machine learning model, we considered the query protein sequence as text and extracted the sequence context features using a natural language model. These word-vector features encode discriminative knowledge of NLS motif frequency and are thus useful for model recognition. The output of the machine learning model will be fused with statistical knowledge of the query sequence to build a final multivariate regression model for NLS peptide identification. The experimental results demonstrate a promising performance of the new INSP approach.

      We built multiple deep learning models with increased complexity, namely a multilayer perceptron (MLP) model and a CapNet model for single-domain relation extraction and fully shared (FS), shared-private (SP), and adversarial training (ADV) modes for multidomain relation extraction. Our models were evaluated in 2 ways: first, we compared our models using our expert-annotated cancer (the MADE1.0 corpus) and cardio corpora; second, we compared our models with the systems in the MADE1.0 and i2b2 challenges. Results:
      
    

    
      Multidomain models outperform single-domain models by 0.7%-1.4% in F1 (t test P < .05), but the results of FS, SP, and ADV modes are mixed. Our results show that the MLP model generally outperforms the CapNet model by 0.1%-1.0% in F1. In the comparisons with other systems, the CapNet model achieves the state-of-the-art result (87.2% in F1) in the cancer corpus and the MLP model generally outperforms MedEx in the cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and i2b2 corpora. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our MLP or CapNet model generally outperforms other state-of-the-art systems in medication and adverse drug event relation extraction.

1523,Technology Solutions for Nurse Leaders,"Over the next 10 years, the World Health Organization estimates that there will be global shortage of 18 000 000 health care workers. A perfect storm of an aging demographic, long-term drop in birth rate, and a retiring workforce has all the factors contributing to this impending crisis. In nursing, efforts to narrow the shortage gap through strategies that increase the number of admissions to nursing schools, such as increasing faculty members, clinical sites, preceptors, and scholarships, will likely not be enough to offset the shortfall. Solutions, in part, will be to make nurses more productive by reducing waste through the use of technology. This article evaluates how various types of technology such as electronic health records, data analytics, predictive modeling, artificial intelligence, speech recognition, natural language processing, robotics, the Internet of Things, and others can improve nurse productivity by using a Lean framework to eliminate waste and create value.","['1 The University of Minnesota School of Nursing, Minneapolis.']","Thomas R Clancy, ",Nursing administration quarterly,Oct/Dec 2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32881802
1524,"Angina Severity, Mortality, and Healthcare Utilization Among Veterans With Stable Angina","Background Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) angina severity classification is associated with mortality, myocardial infarction, and coronary revascularization in clinical trial and registry data. The objective of this study was to determine associations between CCS class and all-cause mortality and healthcare utilization, using natural language processing to extract CCS classifications from clinical notes. Methods and Results In this retrospective cohort study of veterans in the United States with stable angina from January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2013, natural language processing extracted CCS classifications. Veterans with a prior diagnosis of coronary artery disease were excluded. Outcomes included all-cause mortality (primary), all-cause and cardiovascular-specific hospitalizations, coronary revascularization, and 1-year healthcare costs. Of 299 577 veterans identified, 14 216 (4.7%) had ≥1 CCS classification extracted by natural language processing. The mean age was 66.6±9.8 years, 99% of participants were male, and 81% were white. During a median follow-up of 3.4 years, all-cause mortality rates were 4.58, 4.60, 6.22, and 6.83 per 100 person-years for CCS classes I, II, III, and IV, respectively. Multivariable adjusted hazard ratios for all-cause mortality comparing CCS II, III, and IV with those in class I were 1.05 (95% CI, 0.95-1.15), 1.33 (95% CI, 1.20-1.47), and 1.48 (95% CI, 1.25-1.76), respectively. The multivariable hazard ratio comparing CCS IV with CCS I was 1.20 (95% CI, 1.09-1.33) for all-cause hospitalization, 1.25 (95% CI, 0.96-1.64) for acute coronary syndrome hospitalizations, 1.00 (95% CI, 0.80-1.26) for heart failure hospitalizations, 1.05 (95% CI, 0.88-1.25) for atrial fibrillation hospitalizations, 1.92 (95% CI, 1.40-2.64) for percutaneous coronary intervention, and 2.51 (95% CI, 1.99-3.16) for coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. Conclusions Natural language processing-extracted CCS classification was positively associated with all-cause mortality and healthcare utilization, demonstrating the prognostic importance of anginal symptom assessment and documentation.","['1 Leon H.

1525,Induction of T cell-mediated immune response by dendritic cells pulsed with mRNA of sphere-forming cells isolated from patients with gastric cancer,"Gastric cancer (GC) as the third most common cause of cancer-associated mortality worldwide is one of the cancers with very high heterogeneity. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) as a small subset of cancer cells in solid tumors with the self-renewal, differentiation and tumorigenic ability are responsible for tumor initiation, progression, recurrence, metastasis, and resistance to current treatments. Therefore, eradication of CSCs is very vital to cure cancer. Here, we first isolated and identified sphere-forming cells in tumor tissue from four GC patients and then analyzed T cell responses induced by monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) loaded with total mRNA of sphere-forming cells in terms of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) gene expression and specific cytotoxicity. Spheroid colonies were formed in serum-free media. Sphere-forming cells dissociated from tumorspheres heterogeneously expressed CD44, CD54, and epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) markers and generated one tumor in nude mice. These results demonstrated that gastric CSCs were enriched in tumorspheres. Cytokine-matured DCs loaded with mRNA of sphere-forming cells were able to induce IFN-γ gene expression in T-lymphocytes after a 12-day co-culture. mRNA level of IFN-γ gene in these lymphocytes was more highly expressed compared to stimulated T-lymphocytes by DCs transfected with normal tissue (6.4-9.39 folds). Cytotoxic activity of primed T-lymphocytes with antigens of sphere-forming cells was significantly higher than normal tissue antigens and mock DCs (P ≤ 0.0001). Taken together, DCs loaded with mRNA of sphere-forming cells that elicit effectively specific T cell-mediated immune responses in vitro, may be considered as a promising therapeutic vaccination in GC patients in future.","['1 Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Birjand University of Medical Sciences, Birjand, Iran.', '2 Medical Genetics Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.

The goal of this study is to investigate different methods and their effectiveness in identifying patients that meet specific eligibility selection criteria based on patients' longitudinal records. An unstructured dataset released by the n2c2 cohort selection for clinical trials track was used, each of which included 2-5 records manually annotated to thirteen pre-defined selection criteria. Unlike the other studies, we formulated the problem as a multiple instance learning (MIL) task and compared the performance with that of the rule-based and the single instance-based classifiers. Our official best run achieved an average micro-F score of 0.8765 which was ranked as one of the top ten results in the track. Further experiments demonstrated that the performance of the MIL-based classifiers consistently yield better performance than their single-instance counterparts in the criteria that require the overall comprehension of the information distributed among all of the patient's EHRs. Rule-based and single instance learning approaches exhibited better performance in criteria that don't require a consideration of several factors across records. This study demonstrated that cohort selection using longitudinal patient records can be formulated as a MIL problem. Our results exhibit that the MIL-based classifiers supplement the rule-based methods and provide better results in comparison to the single instance learning approaches.","['1 Department of Electrical Engineering, National Kaohsiung University of Science and Technology, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, ROC; School of Post-Baccalaureate Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, ROC; National Institute of Cancer Research, National Health Research Institutes, Taiwan, R.O.C..

1527,Uncovering the relationship between food-related discussion on Twitter and neighborhood characteristics,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Initiatives to reduce neighborhood-based health disparities require access to meaningful, timely, and local information regarding health behavior and its determinants. We examined the validity of Twitter as a source of information for neighborhood-level analysis of dietary choices and attitudes. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      We analyzed the ""healthiness"" quotient and sentiment in food-related tweets at the census tract level, and associated them with neighborhood characteristics and health outcomes. We analyzed keywords driving the differences in food healthiness between the most and least-affluent tracts, and qualitatively analyzed contents of a random sample of tweets. Results:
      
    

    
      Significant, albeit weak, correlations existed between healthiness and sentiment in food-related tweets and tract-level measures of affluence, disadvantage, race, age, U.S. density, and mortality from conditions associated with obesity. Analyses of keywords driving the differences in food healthiness revealed foods high in saturated fat (eg, pizza, bacon, fries) were mentioned more frequently in less-affluent tracts. Food-related discussion referred to activities (eating, drinking, cooking), locations where food was consumed, and positive (affection, cravings, enjoyment) and negative attitudes (dislike, personal struggles, complaints). Discussion:
      
    

    
      Tweet-based healthiness scores largely correlated with offline phenomena in the expected directions. Social media offer less resource-intensive data collection methods than traditional surveys do. Twitter may assist in informing local health programs that focus on drivers of food consumption and could inform interventions focused on attitudes and the food environment. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Twitter provided weak but significant signals concerning food-related behavior and attitudes at the neighborhood level, suggesting its potential usefulness for informing local health disparity reduction efforts.","['1 Department of Learning Health Sciences, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', '2 School of Information, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', '3 Center for the Study of Complex Systems, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', '4 Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', '5 Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', '6 Department of Health Management and Policy, School of Public Health, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', '7 Department of Nutritional Sciences, School of Public Health, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', '8 Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', '9 Department of Statistics, Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, California, USA.', '10 Urban and Regional Planning Program, Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', '11 Department of Health Behavior and Health Education, School of Public Health, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.']","V G Vinod Vydiswaran, Daniel M Romero, Xinyan Zhao, Deahan Yu, Iris Gomez-Lopez, Jin Xiu Lu, Bradley E Iott, Ana Baylin, Erica C Jansen, Philippa Clarke, Veronica J Berrocal, Robert Goodspeed, Tiffany C Veinot, ",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2020,health equity; healthy diet; natural language processing; population health; social media.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31633756

To assess this, an NLP algorithm was trained to identify potential surgical candidates using 1097 notes from 175 epilepsy patients with a history of resective epilepsy surgery and 268 patients who achieved seizure freedom without surgery (total N = 443 patients). The model was tested on 8340 notes from 3776 patients with epilepsy whose surgical candidacy status was unknown (2029 male, 1747 female, median age = 9 years; age range = 0-60 years). Multiple linear regression using demographic variables as covariates was used to test for correlations between patient race and surgical candidacy scores. After accounting for other demographic and socioeconomic variables, patient race, gender, and primary language did not influence surgical candidacy scores (P > .35 for all). Higher scores were given to patients >18 years old who traveled farther to receive care, and those who had a higher family income and public insurance (P < .001, .001, .001, and .01, respectively).

1529,Development and Validation of a Natural Language Processing Algorithm for Surveillance of Cervical and Anal Cancer and Precancer: A Split-validation Study,"Background:
      
    

    
      Accurate identification of new diagnoses of human papillomavirus (HPV) associated cancers and precancers is an important step towards the development of strategies that optimize the use of HPV vaccines. The diagnosis of HPV cancers hinges on a histopathologic report, which is typically stored in the electronic medical records (EMR) as free-form, or unstructured narrative text. Previous efforts to perform surveillance for HPV cancers have relied on the manual review of pathology reports to extract diagnostic information, a process that is both labor- and resource-intensive. Natural Language Processing (NLP) can be used to automate the structuring and extraction of clinical data from unstructured narrative text in medical records and may provide a practical and effective method for identifying patients with HPV vaccine-preventable disease for surveillance and research. Objective:
      
    

    
      The objective of this study was to develop and assess the accuracy of a NLP algorithm for identification of individuals with cancer or pre-cancer of the cervix and anus. Methods:
      
    

    
      A pipeline-based NLP algorithm was developed, which incorporated both machine-learning and rule-based methods to extract diagnostic elements from the narrative pathology reports. To test the algorithm's classification accuracy, we used a split-validation study design. Full length cervical and anal pathology reports were randomly selected from 4 clinical pathology laboratories. Two study team members, blinded to the classifications produced by the NLP algorithm, manually and independently reviewed all reports and classified them at the document level according to two domains (diagnosis and HPV testing results). Using the manual review as the ""gold-standard"", the algorithm's performance was evaluated using standard measurements of accuracy (true positive and true negatives / total number of reports), recall (true positives / positive reports by gold-standard), precision (true positives / positive reports by NLP), and f-measure (harmonic mean of recall and precision). Results:
      
    

    
      The NLP algorithm's performance was validated on 949 pathology reports (anal cytology = 105, anal histology = 95, cervical cytology = 449, and cervical histology = 404). The NLP algorithm demonstrated accurate identification of abnormal cytology, histology, and positive HPV tests with accuracies greater than 0.91 in all specimens. Precision (also known as positive predictive value) was lowest for anal histology reports (0.87; 95%CI = 0.59-0.98) and highest for cervical cytology (0.98; 95%CI= 0.95-0.99). The NLP algorithm missed two out of the 15 abnormal anal histology reports, which led to the relatively low recall/sensitivity (0.68; 95%CI= 0.43-0.87). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      This study outlines the development and validity testing of a freely available and easily implementable NLP algorithm that is able to automate the extraction and classification of clinical data from cervical and anal cytology and histology reports with high accuracy.

1530,Identification of a Promiscuous Epitope Peptide Derived From HSP70,"We previously found that heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70) is expressed on hepatocellular carcinoma cells and developed an HSP70 mRNA-transfected dendritic cell therapy for treating unresectable or recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma. The phase I trial was completed successfully. The purpose of this study is to identify a promiscuous epitope peptide derived from HSP70 for the purpose of developing a novel cancer peptide vaccine. Using a computational algorithm to analyze the specificity of previously reported major histocompatibility complex class I-binding peptides, we selected candidates that bound to >2 of the 3 HLA types. Twenty-nine HSP70-derived peptides (9-mers) that bound to HLA-class I was selected. The peptides were prioritized based on the results of peptide binding experiments. Using dendritic cells stimulated with the candidate peptide described previously as stimulators and CD8 T cells as effectors, an ELISPOT assay was performed. Cytotoxicity of CD8 lymphocytes stimulated with the candidate peptides toward HSP70-expressing cancer cells was analyzed using an xCELLigence System. Peptides were administered to HLA-A 24 transgenic mice as vaccines, and peptide-specific T-cell induction was measured in vivo. We identified a multi-HLA-class I-binding epitope peptide that bound to HLA-A*02:01, *02:06, and *24:02 in vitro using an interferon-γ ELISPOT immune response induction assay. Cytotoxicity was confirmed in vitro, and safety and immune response induction were confirmed in vivo using HLA-A 24 transgenic mice. Our study demonstrated that the promiscuous HSP70-derived peptide is applicable to cancer immunotherapy in patients with HLA-A*24:02-positive, *02:01-positive, and *02:06-positive HSP70-expressing cancers.","['1 Departments of Gastroenterological, Breast, and Endocrine Surgery.', '2 Translational Research and Developmental Therapeutics against Cancer.', '3 Immunology, Yamaguchi University Graduate School of Medicine.', '4 Department of Immunology, Kochi Medical School, Kochi.', '5 Department of Immunogenetics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto.', '6 NEC Corporation, Tokyo.', '7 Yamaguchi University Hospital Cancer Center, Yamaguchi.', '8 Department of Digestive Surgery, Kawasaki Medical School, Kurashiki, Japan.']","Hiroto Matsui, Shoichi Hazama, Koji Tamada, Keiko Udaka, Atsushi Irie, Yasuharu Nishimura, Tomoya Miyakawa, Shun Doi, Masao Nakajima, Shinsuke Kanekiyo, Yukio Tokumitsu, Yoshitaro Shindo, Shinobu Tomochika, Shin Yoshida, Michihisa Iida, Nobuaki Suzuki, Shigeru Takeda, Shigeru Yamamoto, Shigefumi Yoshino, Tomio Ueno, Hiroaki Nagano, ","Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)",2019 Sep,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31398179
1531,Automatic Incident Triage in Radiation Oncology Incident Learning System,"The Radiotherapy Incident Reporting and Analysis System (RIRAS) receives incident reports from Radiation Oncology facilities across the US Veterans Health Affairs (VHA) enterprise and Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU). In this work, we propose a computational pipeline for analysis of radiation oncology incident reports. Our pipeline uses machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) based methods to predict the severity of the incidents reported in the RIRAS platform using the textual description of the reported incidents. These incidents in RIRAS are reviewed by a radiation oncology subject matter expert (SME), who initially triages some incidents based on the salient elements in the incident report. To automate the triage process, we used the data from the VHA treatment centers and the VCU radiation oncology department. We used NLP combined with traditional ML algorithms, including support vector machine (SVM) with linear kernel, and compared it against the transfer learning approach with the universal language model fine-tuning (ULMFiT) algorithm. In RIRAS, severities are divided into four categories; A, B, C, and D, with A being the most severe to D being the least. In this work, we built models to predict High (A & B) vs. Low (C & D) severity instead of all the four categories. Models were evaluated with macro-averaged precision, recall, and F1-Score. The Traditional ML machine learning (SVM-linear) approach did well on the VHA dataset with 0.78 F1-Score but performed poorly on the VCU dataset with 0.5 F1-Score. The transfer learning approach did well on both datasets with 0.81 F1-Score on VHA dataset and 0.68 F1-Score on the VCU dataset. Overall, our methods show promise in automating the triage and severity determination process from radiotherapy incident reports.","['1 Department of Computer Science, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23284, USA.', '2 Department of Radiation Oncology, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23298, USA.', '3 Department of Veteran Affairs, National Radiation Oncology Program, Richmond, VA 23249, USA.']","Khajamoinuddin Syed, William Sleeman 4th, Michael Hagan, Jatinder Palta, Rishabh Kapoor, Preetam Ghosh, ","Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)",2020,automated triage; deep learning; incident learning system; natural language processing; transfer learning.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32823971
1532,"Endogenous CD4 + T Cells Recognize Neoantigens in Lung Cancer Patients, Including Recurrent Oncogenic KRAS and ERBB2 ( Her2) Driver Mutations","T cells specific for neoantigens encoded by mutated genes in cancers are increasingly recognized as mediators of tumor destruction after immune-checkpoint inhibitor therapy or adoptive cell transfer. Much of the focus has been on identifying epitopes presented to CD8+ T cells by class I MHC. However, CD4+ class II MHC-restricted T cells have been shown to have an important role in antitumor immunity. Unfortunately, the vast majority of neoantigens recognized by CD8+ or CD4+ T cells in cancer patients result from random mutations and are patient-specific. Here, we screened the blood of 5 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients for T-cell responses to candidate mutation-encoded neoepitopes. T-cell responses were detected to 8.8% of screened antigens, with 1 to 7 antigens identified per patient. A majority of responses were to random, patient-specific mutations. However, CD4+ T cells that recognized the recurrent KRAS G12V and the ERBB2 (Her2) internal tandem duplication (ITD) oncogenic driver mutations, but not the corresponding wild-type sequences, were identified in two patients. Two different T-cell receptors (TCR) specific for KRAS G12V and one T-cell receptor specific for Her2-ITD were isolated and conferred antigen specificity when transfected into T cells. Deep sequencing identified the Her2-ITD-specific TCR in the tumor but not nonadjacent lung. Our results showed that CD4+ T-cell responses to neoantigens, including recurrent driver mutations, can be derived from the blood of NSCLC patients. These data support the use of adoptive transfer or vaccination to augment CD4+ neoantigen-specific T cells and elucidate their role in human antitumor immunity.","['1 Immunotherapy Integrated Research Center, Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington. jveatch@fhcrc.org.', '2 Immunotherapy Integrated Research Center, Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', '3 Otto Loewi Research Center, Pharmacology, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.', '4 Division of Medical Oncology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.']","Joshua R Veatch, Brenda L Jesernig, Julia Kargl, Matthew Fitzgibbon, Sylvia M Lee, Christina Baik, Renato Martins, A McGarry Houghton, Stanley R Riddell, ",Cancer immunology research,2019 Jun,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31043415

This review provides a technical and clinical overview of deep learning in radiology. To gain a more practical understanding of deep learning, deep learning techniques are divided into five categories: classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, image processing, and natural language processing. After a brief overview of technical network evolutions, clinical applications based on deep learning are introduced. The clinical applications are then summarized to reveal the features of deep learning, which are highly dependent on training and test datasets. The core technology in deep learning is developed by image classification tasks. In the medical field, radiologists are specialists in such tasks. Using clinical applications based on deep learning would, therefore, be expected to contribute to substantial improvements in radiology. By gaining a better understanding of the features of deep learning, radiologists could be expected to lead medical development.","['1 Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, Osaka City University Graduate School of Medicine, 1-4-3 Asahi-machi, Abeno-ku, Osaka, 545-8585, Japan. ueda.daiju@gmail.com.', '2 Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, Osaka City University Graduate School of Medicine, 1-4-3 Asahi-machi, Abeno-ku, Osaka, 545-8585, Japan.']","Daiju Ueda, Akitoshi Shimazaki, Yukio Miki, ",Japanese journal of radiology,2019 Jan,AI; Artificial intelligence; Deep learning; Neural network; Radiology; Review.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30506448
1534,Trends in Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction for Patients With a New Diagnosis of Heart Failure,"Background:
      
    

    
      The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) guides treatment of heart failure, yet this data has not been systematically collected in large data sets. We sought to characterize the epidemiology of incident heart failure using the initial LVEF. Methods:
      
    

    
      We identified 219 537 patients in the Veterans Affairs system between 2011 and 2017 who had an LVEF documented within 365 days before and 30 days after the heart failure diagnosis date. LVEF was obtained from natural language processing from imaging and provider notes. In multivariate analysis, we assessed characteristics associated with having an initial LVEF <40%. Results:
      
    

    
      Most patients were male and White; a plurality were within the 60 to 69 year age decile. A majority of patients had ischemic heart disease and a high burden of co-morbidities. Over time, presentation with an LVEF <40% became slightly less common, with a nadir in 2015. Presentation with an initial LVEF <40% was more common in younger patients, men, Black and Hispanic patients, an inpatient presentation, lower systolic blood pressure, lower pulse pressure, and higher heart rate. Ischemic heart disease, alcohol use disorder, peripheral arterial disease, and ventricular arrhythmias were associated with an initial LVEF <40%, while most other comorbid conditions (eg, atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malignancy) were more strongly associated with an initial LVEF >50%. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      For patients with heart failure, particularly at the extremes of age, an initial preserved LVEF is common. In addition to clinical characteristics, certain races (Black and Hispanic) were more likely to present with a reduced LVEF. Further studies are needed to determine if racial differences are due to patient or health systems issues such as access to care.","['1 Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, CA (R.L.T., F.H., P.A.H.).', '2 Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System, Stanford, CA (R.L.T., P.A.H.).', '3 Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan (S.K.).']","Rebecca L Tisdale, François Haddad, Shun Kohsaka, Paul A Heidenreich, ",Circulation.

Previous studies mainly focused on how DNA or histone modification determines cell fate in cancer. However, it is still largely unknown how RNA modifications orchestrate cancer cell fate decisions. More than 170 distinct RNA modifications have been identified in the RNA world, while only a few RNA base modifications have been found in mRNA. Growing evidence indicates that three mRNA modifications, inosine, 5-methylcytosine, and N6-methyladenosine, are essential for the regulation of spatiotemporal gene expression during cancer stem cell fate transition. Furthermore, transcriptome-wide mapping has found that the aberrant deposition of mRNA modification, which can disrupt the gene regulatory network and lead to uncontrollable cancer cell growth, is widespread across different cancers. In this review, we try to summarize the recent advances of these three mRNA modifications in maintaining the stemness of cancer stem cells and discuss the underlying molecular mechanisms, which will shed light on the development of novel therapeutic approaches for eradicating cancer stem cells.","['1 Vaccine Research Institute, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', '2 Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Liver Disease Research, Guangzhou, China.', '3 Cell-gene Therapy Translational Medicine Research Center, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', '4 Department of Medical Oncology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', '5 Vaccine Research Institute, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China. keekee77@126.com.', '6 Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Liver Disease Research, Guangzhou, China. keekee77@126.com.', '7 Cell-gene Therapy Translational Medicine Research Center, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China. keekee77@126.com.']","Weicheng Liang, Zexiao Lin, Cong Du, Dongbo Qiu, Qi Zhang, ",Molecular cancer,2020,5-methylcytosine; A-to-I editing; Cancer stem cells; N6-methyladenosine; RNA modification.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32101138
1536,Prediction of N6-methyladenosine sites using convolution neural network model based on distributed feature representations,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a well-studied and most common interior messenger RNA (mRNA) modification that plays an important function in cell development. N6A is found in all kingdoms​ of life and many other cellular processes such as RNA splicing, immune tolerance, regulatory functions, RNA processing, and cancer. Despite the crucial role of m6A in cells, it was targeted computationally, but unfortunately, the obtained results were unsatisfactory. It is imperative to develop an efficient computational model that can truly represent m6A sites. In this regard, an intelligent and highly discriminative computational model namely: m6A-word2vec is introduced for the discrimination of m6A sites. Here, a concept of natural language processing in the form of word2vec is used to represent the motif of the target class automatically. These motifs (numerical descriptors) are automatically targeted from the human genome without any clear definition. Further, the extracted feature space is then forwarded to the convolution neural network model as input for prediction. The developed computational model obtained 83.17%, 92.69%, and 90.50% accuracy for benchmark datasets S1, S2, and S3, respectively, using a 10-fold cross-validation test. The predictive outcomes validate that the developed intelligent computational model showed better performance compared to existing computational models. It is thus greatly estimated that the introduced computational model ""m6A-word2vec"" may be a supportive and practical tool for elementary and pharmaceutical research such as in drug design along with academia.","['1 Department of Computer Science, Abdul Wali Khan University Mardan 23200, KP, Pakistan; Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju 54896, South Korea.', '2 Department of Computer Science, Abdul Wali Khan University Mardan 23200, KP, Pakistan.

1537,Design and Development of Modified mRNA Encoding Core Antigen of Hepatitis C Virus: a Possible Application in Vaccine Production,"Background:
      
    

    
      Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a ‎blood-borne pathogen, resulting in liver cirrhosis and liver cancer. Despite of many efforts in development of treatments for HCV, no vaccine has been licensed yet. The purpose of this study was ‎to design and prepare a specific mRNA, without 5' cap and poly (A) tail transcribed in vitro capable of coding core protein and also to determine its functionality. Methods:
      
    

    
      Candidate mRNA was prepared by in vitro transcription of the designed construct consisting of ‎‎5ʹ and 3ʹ untranslated regions of heat shock proteins 70 (hsp70) mRNA, T7 promoter, internal ribosome entry site (IRES) sequences of eIF4G related to human dendritic cells (DCs), and the ‎Core gene of HCV. To design the modified mRNA, the ‎‎5' cap and poly (A) tail structures were not considered. DCs were transfected by in vitro-transcribed messenger RNA (IVT-mRNA) and the expressions of green fluorescent protein (GFP), and Core genes were determined by microscopic examination and Western blotting assay. Results:
      
    

    
      Cell transfection results showed that despite the absence of ‎‎5' cap and poly (A) tail, the structure of the mRNA ‎was stable. Moreover, the successful expressions of GFP and Core genes were achieved. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Our findings indicated the effectiveness of a designed IVT-mRNA harboring the Core gene of HCV in transfecting and expressing the antigens in DCs. Considering the simple and efficient protocol for the preparation of this IVT-mRNA and its effectiveness in expressing the gene that it carries, this IVT-mRNA could be suitable for development of an RNA vaccine against HCV.","['1 Drug Applied Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', '2 Department of Medical Biotechnology, Faculty of Advanced Medical Sciences, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', '3 Cellular and Molecular Biology Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', '4 Department of Biotechnology, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', '5 Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Laboratories Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.']","Zarin Sharifnia, Mojgan Bandehpour, Bahram Kazemi, Nosratollah Zarghami, ",Iranian biomedical journal,2019 Jan,Hepatitis C; Messenger; RNA; Vaccines.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30056690
1538,Electronic health record-based disease surveillance systems: A systematic literature review on challenges and solutions,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Disease surveillance systems are expanding using electronic health records (EHRs). However, there are many challenges in this regard. In the present study, the solutions and challenges of implementing EHR-based disease surveillance systems (EHR-DS) have been reviewed. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      We searched the related keywords in ProQuest, PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Scopus. Then, we assessed and selected articles using the inclusion and exclusion criteria and, finally, classified the identified solutions and challenges. Results:
      
    

    
      Finally, 50 studies were included, and 52 unique solutions and 47 challenges were organized into 6 main themes (policy and regulatory, technical, management, standardization, financial, and data quality). The results indicate that due to the multifaceted nature of the challenges, the implementation of EHR-DS is not low cost and easy to implement and requires a variety of interventions. On the one hand, the most common challenges include the need to invest significant time and resources; the poor data quality in EHRs; difficulty in analyzing, cleaning, and accessing unstructured data; data privacy and security; and the lack of interoperability standards. On the other hand, the most common solutions are the use of natural language processing and machine learning algorithms for unstructured data; the use of appropriate technical solutions for data retrieval, extraction, identification, and visualization; the collaboration of health and clinical departments to access data; standardizing EHR content for public health; and using a unique health identifier for individuals. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      EHR systems have an important role in modernizing disease surveillance systems. However, there are many problems and challenges facing the development and implementation of EHR-DS that need to be appropriately addressed.","['1 Department of Health Information Management, School of Health Management and Information Sciences, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', '2 Health Management and Economics Research Center, Department of Health Information Management, School of Health Management and Information Sciences, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', '3 Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran.']","Ali Aliabadi, Abbas Sheikhtaheri, Hossein Ansari, ",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2020,challenges; disease surveillance; electronic health record; public health; solutions.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32929458
1539,Identification of Axial Spondyloarthritis Patients in a Large Dataset: The Development and Validation of Novel Methods,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Observational axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) research in large datasets has been limited by a lack of adequate methods for identifying patients with axSpA, because there are no billing codes in the United States for most subtypes of axSpA. The objective of this study was to develop methods to accurately identify patients with axSpA in a large dataset. Methods:
      
    

    
      The study population included 600 chart-reviewed veterans, with and without axSpA, in the Veterans Health Administration between January 1, 2005, and June 30, 2015. AxSpA identification algorithms were developed with variables anticipated by clinical experts to be predictive of an axSpA diagnosis [demographics, billing codes, healthcare use, medications, laboratory results, and natural language processing (NLP) for key SpA features]. Random Forest and 5-fold cross validation were used for algorithm development and testing in the training subset (n = 451). The algorithms were additionally tested in an independent testing subset (n = 149). Results:
      
    

    
      Three algorithms were developed: Full algorithm, High Feasibility algorithm, and Spond NLP algorithm. In the testing subset, the areas under the curve with the receiver-operating characteristic analysis were 0.96, 0.94, and 0.86, for the Full algorithm, High Feasibility algorithm, and Spond NLP algorithm, respectively. Algorithm sensitivities ranged from 85.0% to 95.0%, specificities from 78.0% to 93.6%, and accuracies from 82.6% to 91.3%. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Novel axSpA identification algorithms performed well in classifying patients with axSpA. These algorithms offer a range of performance and feasibility attributes that may be appropriate for a broad array of axSpA studies. Additional research is required to validate the algorithms in other cohorts.","['1 From the Salt Lake City Veteran Affairs Medical Center; the University of Utah Medical Center, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA. jessica.walsh@hsc.utah.edu.', '2 J.A.

1540,Placing language in an integrated understanding system: Next steps toward human-level performance in neural language models,"Language is crucial for human intelligence, but what exactly is its role? We take language to be a part of a system for understanding and communicating about situations. In humans, these abilities emerge gradually from experience and depend on domain-general principles of biological neural networks: connection-based learning, distributed representation, and context-sensitive, mutual constraint satisfaction-based processing. Current artificial language processing systems rely on the same domain general principles, embodied in artificial neural networks. Indeed, recent progress in this field depends on query-based attention, which extends the ability of these systems to exploit context and has contributed to remarkable breakthroughs. Nevertheless, most current models focus exclusively on language-internal tasks, limiting their ability to perform tasks that depend on understanding situations. These systems also lack memory for the contents of prior situations outside of a fixed contextual span. We describe the organization of the brain's distributed understanding system, which includes a fast learning system that addresses the memory problem. We sketch a framework for future models of understanding drawing equally on cognitive neuroscience and artificial intelligence and exploiting query-based attention. We highlight relevant current directions and consider further developments needed to fully capture human-level language understanding in a computational system.","['1 Department of Psychology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305; jlmcc@stanford.edu felixhill@google.com majarita.rudolph@de.bosch.com jasonbaldridge@google.com inquiries@cislmu.org.', '2 DeepMind, London N1C 4AG, United Kingdom.', '3 DeepMind, London N1C 4AG, United Kingdom; jlmcc@stanford.edu felixhill@google.com majarita.rudolph@de.bosch.com jasonbaldridge@google.com inquiries@cislmu.org.', '4 Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence, Renningen 71272, Germany; jlmcc@stanford.edu felixhill@google.com majarita.rudolph@de.bosch.com jasonbaldridge@google.com inquiries@cislmu.org.', '5 Google Research, Austin, TX 78701; jlmcc@stanford.edu felixhill@google.com majarita.rudolph@de.bosch.com jasonbaldridge@google.com inquiries@cislmu.org.', '6 Center for Information and Language Processing, Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, Munich 80538, Germany jlmcc@stanford.edu felixhill@google.com majarita.rudolph@de.bosch.com jasonbaldridge@google.com inquiries@cislmu.org.']","James L McClelland, Felix Hill, Maja Rudolph, Jason Baldridge, Hinrich Schütze, ",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2020,artificial intelligence; cognitive neuroscience; deep learning; natural language understanding; situation models.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32989131
1541,Learning to detect chest radiographs containing pulmonary lesions using visual attention networks,"Machine learning approaches hold great potential for the automated detection of lung nodules on chest radiographs, but training algorithms requires very large amounts of manually annotated radiographs, which are difficult to obtain. The increasing availability of PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System), is laying the technological foundations needed to make available large volumes of clinical data and images from hospital archives. Binary labels indicating whether a radiograph contains a pulmonary lesion can be extracted at scale, using natural language processing algorithms. In this study, we propose two novel neural networks for the detection of chest radiographs containing pulmonary lesions. Both architectures make use of a large number of weakly-labelled images combined with a smaller number of manually annotated x-rays. The annotated lesions are used during training to deliver a type of visual attention feedback informing the networks about their lesion localisation performance. The first architecture extracts saliency maps from high-level convolutional layers and compares the inferred position of a lesion against the true position when this information is available; a localisation error is then back-propagated along with the softmax classification error. The second approach consists of a recurrent attention model that learns to observe a short sequence of smaller image portions through reinforcement learning; the reward function penalises the exploration of areas, within an image, that are unlikely to contain nodules. Using a repository of over 430,000 historical chest radiographs, we present and discuss the proposed methods over related architectures that use either weakly-labelled or annotated images only.","[""1 Department of Biomedical Engineering, King's College London, London, UK."", ""2 Department of Radiology, Guy's & St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK; Department of Cancer Imaging, King's College London, London, UK."", '3 Department of Medicine, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London, UK.', ""4 Department of Biomedical Engineering, King's College London, London, UK.

1542,Preclinical assessment of transiently TCR redirected T cells for solid tumour immunotherapy,"Off-target toxicity due to the expression of target antigens in normal tissue or TCR cross-reactivity represents a major risk when using T cell receptor (TCR)-engineered T cells for treatment of solid tumours. Due to the inherent cross-reactivity of TCRs it is difficult to accurately predict their target recognition pre-clinically. It has become evident that direct testing in a human being represents the best evaluation of the risks. There is, therefore, a clear unmet need for assessing the safety of a therapeutic TCR in a more controllable manner than by the injection of permanently modified cellular products. Using transiently modified T cells combined with dose escalation has already been shown feasible for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered T cells, but nothing is yet reported for TCR. We performed a preclinical evaluation of a therapeutic TCR transiently expressed in T cells by mRNA electroporation. We analyzed if the construct was active in vitro, how long it was detectable for and if this expression format was adapted to in vivo efficacy assessment. Our data demonstrate the potential of mRNA engineered T cells, although less powerful than permanent redirection, to induce a significant response. Thus, these findings support the development of mRNA based TCR-therapy strategies as a feasible and efficacious method for evaluating TCR safety and efficacy in first-in-man testing.","['1 Department of Cellular Therapy, Department of Oncology, Oslo University Hospital, The Norwegian Radium Hospital, 0379, Oslo, Norway.', '2 Department of Cancer Immunology, Institute for Cancer Research, Oslo University Hospital, The Norwegian Radium Hospital, 0379, Oslo, Norway.', '3 Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, 0316, Oslo, Norway.', '4 Department of Cellular Therapy, Department of Oncology, Oslo University Hospital, The Norwegian Radium Hospital, 0379, Oslo, Norway. sebastw@rr-research.no.', '5 Department of Cellular Therapy, Department of Oncology, Oslo University Hospital, The Norwegian Radium Hospital, 0379, Oslo, Norway. elsmar@rr-research.no.']","Nadia Mensali, Marit Renée Myhre, Pierre Dillard, Sylvie Pollmann, Gustav Gaudernack, Gunnar Kvalheim, Sébastien Wälchli, Else Marit Inderberg, ","Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",2019 Aug,Immunotherapy; In vivo model; Solid tumour; T cell receptor; mRNA.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31214732
1543,Emerging atypicalities in functional connectivity of language-related networks in young infants at high familial risk for ASD,"Prior studies have demonstrated that infants and toddlers who later go on to develop autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show atypical functional connectivity as well as altered neural processing of language and other auditory stimuli, but the timeline underlying the emergence of these altered developmental trajectories is still unclear. Here we used resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) during natural sleep to examine the longitudinal development of functional connectivity in language-related networks from 1.5 to 9 months of age. We found that functional connectivity of networks that underlie the integration of sensory and motor representations, which is crucial for language development, is disrupted in infants at high familial risk (HR) for developing ASD as early as 1.5 months of age. By 9 months of age, HR infants showed hyperconnectivity between auditory and somatosensory regions whereas low risk (LR) infants displayed greater intrahemispheric connectivity between auditory cortex and higher-order temporal regions as well as the hippocampus. Furthermore, while LR infants showed robust changes in functional connectivity during the first year of life with increasing long-range connectivity accompanied by decreasing short-range connectivity over time, HR infants displayed limited developmental changes. Our findings demonstrate that early disruptions in the development of language-related network connectivity may provide an early marker for the later emergence of ASD symptomatology.","['1 Interdepartmental Neuroscience Program, University of California, Los Angeles, 1506 Gonda (Goldschmied) Neuroscience and Genetics Research Center, 695 Charles Young Drive South, Los Angeles, CA, 90095, USA; Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences, University of California, Los Angeles, 760 Westwood Plaza, Los Angeles, CA, 90095, USA; Ahmanson-Lovelace Brain Mapping Center, University of California, Los Angeles, 660 Charles Young Drive South, Los Angeles, CA, 90095, USA.

1544,Perceiving structure in unstructured stimuli: Implicitly acquired prior knowledge impacts the processing of unpredictable transitional probabilities,"It is unclear how implicit prior knowledge is involved and remains persistent in the extraction of the statistical structure underlying sensory input. Therefore, this study investigated whether the implicit knowledge of second-order transitional probabilities characterizing a stream of visual stimuli impacts the processing of unpredictable transitional probabilities embedded in a similar input stream. Young adults (N = 50) performed a four-choice reaction time (RT) task that consisted of structured and unstructured blocks. In the structured blocks, more probable and less probable short-range nonadjacent transitional probabilities were present. In the unstructured blocks, the unique combinations of the short-range transitional probabilities occurred with equal probability; therefore, they were unpredictable. All task blocks were visually identical at the surface level. While one-half of the participants completed the structured blocks first followed by the unstructured blocks, this was reversed in the other half of them. The change in the structure was not explicitly denoted, and no feedback was provided on the correctness of each response. Participants completing the structured blocks first showed faster RTs to more probable than to less probable short-range transitional probabilities in both the structured and unstructured blocks, indicating the persistent effect of prior knowledge. However, after extended exposure to the unstructured blocks, they updated this prior knowledge. Participants completing the unstructured blocks first showed the RT difference only in the structured blocks, which was not constrained by the preceding exposure to unpredictable stimuli. The results altogether suggest that implicitly acquired prior knowledge of predictable stimuli influences the processing of subsequent unpredictable stimuli. Updating this prior knowledge seems to require a longer stretch of time than its initial acquisition.","['1 Brain Imaging Centre, Research Centre for Natural Sciences, Magyar tudósok körútja 2, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary.

1545,Optimized Identification of Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease and Absence of Kidney Disease by Combining Different Electronic Health Data Resources and by Applying Machine Learning Strategies,"Automated identification of advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD ≥ III) and of no known kidney disease (NKD) can support both clinicians and researchers. We hypothesized that identification of CKD and NKD can be improved, by combining information from different electronic health record (EHR) resources, comprising laboratory values, discharge summaries and ICD-10 billing codes, compared to using each component alone. We included EHRs from 785 elderly multimorbid patients, hospitalized between 2010 and 2015, that were divided into a training and a test (n = 156) dataset. We used both the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) and under the precision-recall curve (AUCPR) with a 95% confidence interval for evaluation of different classification models. In the test dataset, the combination of EHR components as a simple classifier identified CKD ≥ III (AUROC 0.96[0.93-0.98]) and NKD (AUROC 0.94[0.91-0.97]) better than laboratory values (AUROC CKD 0.85[0.79-0.90], NKD 0.91[0.87-0.94]), discharge summaries (AUROC CKD 0.87[0.82-0.92], NKD 0.84[0.79-0.89]) or ICD-10 billing codes (AUROC CKD 0.85[0.80-0.91], NKD 0.77[0.72-0.83]) alone. Logistic regression and machine learning models improved recognition of CKD ≥ III compared to the simple classifier if only laboratory values were used (AUROC 0.96[0.92-0.99] vs. 0.86[0.81-0.91], p < 0.05) and improved recognition of NKD if information from previous hospital stays was used (AUROC 0.99[0.98-1.00] vs. 0.95[0.92-0.97]], p < 0.05). Depending on the availability of data, correct automated identification of CKD ≥ III and NKD from EHRs can be improved by generating classification models based on the combination of different EHR components.","['1 Department of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Diagnostics and Integrated Biobank Jena (IBBJ), Jena University Hospital, 07747 Jena, Germany.', '2 Jena University Language & Information Engineering (JULIE) Lab, Friedrich Schiller University Jena, 07743 Jena, Germany.', '3 Data Integration Center, Jena University Hospital, 07743 Jena, Germany.']","Christoph Weber, Lena Röschke, Luise Modersohn, Christina Lohr, Tobias Kolditz, Udo Hahn, Danny Ammon, Boris Betz, Michael Kiehntopf, ",Journal of clinical medicine,2020,"ICD-10 billing codes; area under the precision-recall curve (AUCPR); area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC); artificial neural network (ANN), clinical natural language processing (clinical NLP); chronic kidney disease (CKD); discharge summaries; electronic health record (EHR); estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR); generalized linear model network (GLMnet); laboratory values; machine learning (ML); no known kidney disease (NKD); phenotyping; random forest (RF).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32932685
1546,Extracting entities with attributes in clinical text via joint deep learning,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Extracting clinical entities and their attributes is a fundamental task of natural language processing (NLP) in the medical domain. This task is typically recognized as 2 sequential subtasks in a pipeline, clinical entity or attribute recognition followed by entity-attribute relation extraction. One problem of pipeline methods is that errors from entity recognition are unavoidably passed to relation extraction. We propose a novel joint deep learning method to recognize clinical entities or attributes and extract entity-attribute relations simultaneously. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      The proposed method integrates 2 state-of-the-art methods for named entity recognition and relation extraction, namely bidirectional long short-term memory with conditional random field and bidirectional long short-term memory, into a unified framework. In this method, relation constraints between clinical entities and attributes and weights of the 2 subtasks are also considered simultaneously. We compare the method with other related methods (ie, pipeline methods and other joint deep learning methods) on an existing English corpus from SemEval-2015 and a newly developed Chinese corpus. Results:
      
    

    
      Our proposed method achieves the best F1 of 74.46% on entity recognition and the best F1 of 50.21% on relation extraction on the English corpus, and 89.32% and 88.13% on the Chinese corpora, respectively, which outperform the other methods on both tasks. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The joint deep learning-based method could improve both entity recognition and relation extraction from clinical text in both English and Chinese, indicating that the approach is promising.","['1 Department of Computer Science, Harbin Institute of Technology Shenzhen Graduate School, Shenzhen, China.', '2 Department of Science and Education, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', '3 Peng Cheng Laboratory.', '4 School of Biomedical Informatics, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, Texas, USA.']","Xue Shi, Yingping Yi, Ying Xiong, Buzhou Tang, Qingcai Chen, Xiaolong Wang, Zongcheng Ji, Yaoyun Zhang, Hua Xu, ",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2019,clinical entity or attribute recognition; clinical entity-attribute relation extraction; joint deep learning.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31550346
1547,Chinese Image Caption Generation via Visual Attention and Topic Modeling,"Automatic image captioning is to conduct the cross-modal conversion from image visual content to natural language text. Involving computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP), it has become one of the most sophisticated research issues in the artificial-intelligence area. Based on the deep neural network, the neural image caption (NIC) model has achieved remarkable performance in image captioning, yet there still remain some essential challenges, such as the deviation between descriptive sentences generated by the model and the intrinsic content expressed by the image, the low accuracy of the image scene description, and the monotony of generated sentences. In addition, most of the current datasets and methods for image captioning are in English. However, considering the distinction between Chinese and English in syntax and semantics, it is necessary to develop specialized Chinese image caption generation methods to accommodate the difference. To solve the aforementioned problems, we design the NICVATP2L model via visual attention and topic modeling, in which the visual attention mechanism reduces the deviation and the topic model improves the accuracy and diversity of generated sentences. Specifically, in the encoding phase, convolutional neural network (CNN) and topic model are used to extract visual and topic features of the input images, respectively. In the decoding phase, an attention mechanism is applied to processing image visual features for obtaining image visual region features. Finally, the topic features and the visual region features are combined to guide the two-layer long short-term memory (LSTM) network for generating Chinese image captions. To justify our model, we have conducted experiments over the Chinese AIC-ICC image dataset. The experimental results show that our model can automatically generate more informative and descriptive captions in Chinese in a more natural way, and it outperforms the existing image captioning NIC model.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Maofu Liu, Huijun Hu, Lingjun Li, Yan Yu, Weili Guan, ",IEEE transactions on cybernetics,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32568717
1548,Towards scaling Twitter for digital epidemiology of birth defects,"Social media has recently been used to identify and study a small cohort of Twitter users whose pregnancies with birth defect outcomes-the leading cause of infant mortality-could be observed via their publicly available tweets. In this study, we exploit social media on a larger scale by developing natural language processing (NLP) methods to automatically detect, among thousands of users, a cohort of mothers reporting that their child has a birth defect. We used 22,999 annotated tweets to train and evaluate supervised machine learning algorithms-feature-engineered and deep learning-based classifiers-that automatically distinguish tweets referring to the user's pregnancy outcome from tweets that merely mention birth defects. Because 90% of the tweets merely mention birth defects, we experimented with under-sampling and over-sampling approaches to address this class imbalance. An SVM classifier achieved the best performance for the two positive classes: an F1-score of 0.65 for the ""defect"" class and 0.51 for the ""possible defect"" class. We deployed the classifier on 20,457 unlabeled tweets that mention birth defects, which helped identify 542 additional users for potential inclusion in our cohort. Contributions of this study include (1) NLP methods for automatically detecting tweets by users reporting their birth defect outcomes, (2) findings that an SVM classifier can outperform a deep neural network-based classifier for highly imbalanced social media data, (3) evidence that automatic classification can be used to identify additional users for potential inclusion in our cohort, and (4) a publicly available corpus for training and evaluating supervised machine learning algorithms.","['1 1Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics Perelman School of Medicine University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA USA.', '2 2Department of Biomedical Informatics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA USA.']","Ari Z Klein, Abeed Sarker, Davy Weissenbacher, Graciela Gonzalez-Hernandez, ",NPJ digital medicine,2019,Data mining; Epidemiology.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31583284
1549,Non-adjacent Dependency Learning in Humans and Other Animals,"Learning and processing natural language requires the ability to track syntactic relationships between words and phrases in a sentence, which are often separated by intervening material. These nonadjacent dependencies can be studied using artificial grammar learning paradigms and structured sequence processing tasks. These approaches have been used to demonstrate that human adults, infants and some nonhuman animals are able to detect and learn dependencies between nonadjacent elements within a sequence. However, learning nonadjacent dependencies appears to be more cognitively demanding than detecting dependencies between adjacent elements, and only occurs in certain circumstances. In this review, we discuss different types of nonadjacent dependencies in language and in artificial grammar learning experiments, and how these differences might impact learning. We summarize different types of perceptual cues that facilitate learning, by highlighting the relationship between dependent elements bringing them closer together either physically, attentionally, or perceptually. Finally, we review artificial grammar learning experiments in human adults, infants, and nonhuman animals, and discuss how similarities and differences observed across these groups can provide insights into how language is learned across development and how these language-related abilities might have evolved.","['1 Institute of Neuroscience, Newcastle University.', '2 Department of Cognitive Biology, University of Vienna.', '3 Research Department, Sealcentre Pieterburen.', '4 Artificial Intelligence Lab, Vrije Universiteit Brussel.', '5 Institute of Cognitive Science, University of Osnabrueck.', '6 Departments of Psychology and Linguistics, University of Southern California.', '7 Utrecht Institute of Linguistics OTS, Utrecht University.', '8 Department of Linguistics, University of Potsdam.', '9 Centre for Language Evolution, University of Edinburgh.', '10 CNRS, Aix-Marseille University.']","Benjamin Wilson, Michelle Spierings, Andrea Ravignani, Jutta L Mueller, Toben H Mintz, Frank Wijnen, Anne van der Kant, Kenny Smith, Arnaud Rey, ",Topics in cognitive science,2020 Jul,Artificial grammar; Human; Infant; Non-adjacent dependency; Nonhuman animal; Primate; Structured sequence processing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32729673
1550,Development of a Consumer Health Vocabulary by Mining Health Forum Texts Based on Word Embedding: Semiautomatic Approach,"Background:
      
    

    
      The vocabulary gap between consumers and professionals in the medical domain hinders information seeking and communication. Consumer health vocabularies have been developed to aid such informatics applications. This purpose is best served if the vocabulary evolves with consumers' language. Objective:
      
    

    
      Our objective is to develop a method for identifying and adding new terms to consumer health vocabularies, so that it can keep up with the constantly evolving medical knowledge and language use. Methods:
      
    

    
      In this paper, we propose a consumer health term-finding framework based on a distributed word vector space model. We first learned word vectors from a large-scale text corpus and then adopted a supervised method with existing consumer health vocabularies for learning vector representation of words, which can provide additional supervised fine tuning after unsupervised word embedding learning. With a fine-tuned word vector space, we identified pairs of professional terms and their consumer variants by their semantic distance in the vector space. A subsequent manual review of the extracted and labeled pairs of entities was conducted to validate the results generated by the proposed approach. The results were evaluated using mean reciprocal rank (MRR). Results:
      
    

    
      Manual evaluation showed that it is feasible to identify alternative medical concepts by using professional or consumer concepts as queries in the word vector space without fine tuning, but the results are more promising in the final fine-tuned word vector space. The MRR values indicated that on an average, a professional or consumer concept is about 14th closest to its counterpart in the word vector space without fine tuning, and the MRR in the final fine-tuned word vector space is 8. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that our method can collect abbreviations and common typos frequently used by consumers. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      By integrating a large amount of text information and existing consumer health vocabularies, our method outperformed several baseline ranking methods and is effective for generating a list of candidate terms for human review during consumer health vocabulary development.","['1 Synyi Research, Shanghai, China.', '2 Center for Medical Informatics, Peking University, Beijing, China.', '3 Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', '4 School of Stomatology, Peking University, Beijing, China.', '5 APEX Data & Knowledge Management Lab, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', '6 Department of Healthcare Policy and Research, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, United States.', '7 School of Medical Informatics and Engineering, Southwest Medical University, Luzhou city, Sichuan Province, China.']","Gen Gu, Xingting Zhang, Xingeng Zhu, Zhe Jian, Ken Chen, Dong Wen, Li Gao, Shaodian Zhang, Fei Wang, Handong Ma, Jianbo Lei, ",JMIR medical informatics,2019,consumer health information; consumer health vocabulary; natural language processing; ontology enrichment; representation learning; word embedding.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31124461
1551,Comparing deep learning architectures for sentiment analysis on drug reviews,"Since the turn of the century, as millions of user's opinions are available on the web, sentiment analysis has become one of the most fruitful research fields in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Research on sentiment analysis has covered a wide range of domains such as economy, polity, and medicine, among others. In the pharmaceutical field, automatic analysis of online user reviews allows for the analysis of large amounts of user's opinions and to obtain relevant information about the effectiveness and side effects of drugs, which could be used to improve pharmacovigilance systems. Throughout the years, approaches for sentiment analysis have progressed from simple rules to advanced machine learning techniques such as deep learning, which has become an emerging technology in many NLP tasks. Sentiment analysis is not oblivious to this success, and several systems based on deep learning have recently demonstrated their superiority over former methods, achieving state-of-the-art results on standard sentiment analysis datasets. However, prior work shows that very few attempts have been made to apply deep learning to sentiment analysis of drug reviews. We present a benchmark comparison of various deep learning architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks. We propose several combinations of these models and also study the effect of different pre-trained word embedding models. As transformers have revolutionized the NLP field achieving state-of-art results for many NLP tasks, we also explore Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) with a Bi-LSTM for the sentiment analysis of drug reviews. Our experiments show that the usage of BERT obtains the best results, but with a very high training time. On the other hand, CNN achieves acceptable results while requiring less training time.","['1 Computer Science Department, University Carlos III of Madrid, Avenida de la Universidad 30, 28911, Leganés, Madrid, Spain.

1552,How to automatically turn patient experience free-text responses into actionable insights: a natural language programming (NLP) approach,"Background:
      
    

    
      Patient experience surveys often include free-text responses. Analysis of these responses is time-consuming and often underutilized. This study examined whether Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques could provide a data-driven, hospital-independent solution to indicate points for quality improvement. Methods:
      
    

    
      This retrospective study used routinely collected patient experience data from two hospitals. A data-driven NLP approach was used. Free-text responses were categorized into topics, subtopics (i.e. n-grams) and labelled with a sentiment score. The indicator 'impact', combining sentiment and frequency, was calculated to reveal topics to improve, monitor or celebrate. The topic modelling architecture was tested on data from a second hospital to examine whether the architecture is transferable to another hospital. Results:
      
    

    
      A total of 38,664 survey responses from the first hospital resulted in 127 topics and 294 n-grams. The indicator 'impact' revealed n-grams to celebrate (15.3%), improve (8.8%), and monitor (16.7%). For hospital 2, a similar percentage of free-text responses could be labelled with a topic and n-grams. Between-hospitals, most topics (69.7%) were similar, but 32.2% of topics for hospital 1 and 29.0% of topics for hospital 2 were unique. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      In both hospitals, NLP techniques could be used to categorize patient experience free-text responses into topics, sentiment labels and to define priorities for improvement. The model's architecture was shown to be hospital-specific as it was able to discover new topics for the second hospital. These methods should be considered for future patient experience analyses to make better use of this valuable source of information.","['1 IT Department, Leiden University Medical Center, Albinusdreef 2, Postbus 9600, Postzone D-01-P, 2300 RC, Leiden, The Netherlands. s.cammel@lumc.nl.', '2 Department of Surgery, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', '3 Department of Medical Decision Making, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', '4 Department of Quality and Patient Safety, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', '5 Department of Human Genetics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', '6 Department of Biomedical Data Sciences, Medical Decision Making, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.']","Simone A Cammel, Marit S De Vos, Daphne van Soest, Kristina M Hettne, Fred Boer, Ewout W Steyerberg, Hileen Boosman, ",BMC medical informatics and decision making,2020,Data science; Machine learning; Natural language processing; PREM; Patient experience analysis; Text analytics.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32460734
1553,The Role of Negative Information in Distributional Semantic Learning,"Distributional models of semantics learn word meanings from contextual co-occurrence patterns across a large sample of natural language. Early models, such as LSA and HAL (Landauer & Dumais, 1997; Lund & Burgess, 1996), counted co-occurrence events; later models, such as BEAGLE (Jones & Mewhort, 2007), replaced counting co-occurrences with vector accumulation. All of these models learned from positive information only: Words that occur together within a context become related to each other. A recent class of distributional models, referred to as neural embedding models, are based on a prediction process embedded in the functioning of a neural network: Such models predict words that should surround a target word in a given context (e.g., word2vec; Mikolov, Sutskever, Chen, Corrado, & Dean, 2013). An error signal derived from the prediction is used to update each word's representation via backpropagation. However, another key difference in predictive models is their use of negative information in addition to positive information to develop a semantic representation. The models use negative examples to predict words that should not surround a word in a given context. As before, an error signal derived from the prediction prompts an update of the word's representation, a procedure referred to as negative sampling. Standard uses of word2vec recommend a greater or equal ratio of negative to positive sampling. The use of negative information in developing a representation of semantic information is often thought to be intimately associated with word2vec's prediction process. We assess the role of negative information in developing a semantic representation and show that its power does not reflect the use of a prediction mechanism. Finally, we show how negative information can be efficiently integrated into classic count-based semantic models using parameter-free analytical transformations.","['1 Department of Communicative Disorders and Sciences, University at Buffalo.', ""2 Department of Psychology, Queen's University."", '3 Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Indiana University.']","Brendan T Johns, Douglas J K Mewhort, Michael N Jones, ",Cognitive science,2019 May,Big data; Cognitive modeling; Distributional semantics; Machine learning; Natural language processing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31087587
1554,Patient Perception of Plain-Language Medical Notes Generated Using Artificial Intelligence Software: Pilot Mixed-Methods Study,"Background:
      
    

    
      Clinicians' time with patients has become increasingly limited due to regulatory burden, documentation and billing, administrative responsibilities, and market forces. These factors limit clinicians' time to deliver thorough explanations to patients. OpenNotes began as a research initiative exploring the ability of sharing medical notes with patients to help patients understand their health care. Providing patients access to their medical notes has been shown to have many benefits, including improved patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes. OpenNotes has since evolved into a national movement that helps clinicians share notes with patients. However, a significant barrier to the widespread adoption of OpenNotes has been clinicians' concerns that OpenNotes may cost additional time to correct patient confusion over medical language. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technology may help resolve this concern by converting medical notes to plain language with minimal time required of clinicians. Objective:
      
    

    
      This pilot study assesses patient comprehension and perceived benefits, concerns, and insights regarding an AI-simplified note through comprehension questions and guided interview. Methods:
      
    

    
      Synthea, a synthetic patient generator, was used to generate a standardized medical-language patient note which was then simplified using AI software. A multiple-choice comprehension assessment questionnaire was drafted with physician input. Study participants were recruited from inpatients at the University of Colorado Hospital. Participants were randomly assigned to be tested for their comprehension of the standardized medical-language version or AI-generated plain-language version of the patient note. Following this, participants reviewed the opposite version of the note and participated in a guided interview. A Student t test was performed to assess for differences in comprehension assessment scores between plain-language and medical-language note groups. Multivariate modeling was performed to assess the impact of demographic variables on comprehension. Interview responses were thematically analyzed. Results:
      
    

    
      Twenty patients agreed to participate. The mean number of comprehension assessment questions answered correctly was found to be higher in the plain-language group compared with the medical-language group; however, the Student t test was found to be underpowered to determine if this was significant. Age, ethnicity, and health literacy were found to have a significant impact on comprehension scores by multivariate modeling. Thematic analysis of guided interviews highlighted patients' perceived benefits, concerns, and suggestions regarding such notes. Major themes of benefits were that simplified plain-language notes may (1) be more useable than unsimplified medical-language notes, (2) improve the patient-clinician relationship, and (3) empower patients through an enhanced understanding of their health care. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      AI software may translate medical notes into plain-language notes that are perceived as beneficial by patients. Limitations included sample size, inpatient-only setting, and possible confounding factors. Larger studies are needed to assess comprehension. Insight from patient responses to guided interviews can guide the future study and development of this technology.","['1 College of Medicine, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, United States.', '2 Division of Hospital Medicine, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, United States.']","Sandeep Bala, Angela Keniston, Marisha Burden, ",JMIR formative research,2020,Open Notes; OpenNotes; artificial intelligence; natural language processing; patient education; patient-physician relationship; plain-language notes; simplified notes.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32442148
1555,Children's rare disease cohorts: an integrative research and clinical genomics initiative,"While genomic data is frequently collected under distinct research protocols and disparate clinical and research regimes, there is a benefit in streamlining sequencing strategies to create harmonized databases, particularly in the area of pediatric rare disease. Research hospitals seeking to implement unified genomics workflows for research and clinical practice face numerous challenges, as they need to address the unique requirements and goals of the distinct environments and many stakeholders, including clinicians, researchers and sequencing providers. Here, we present outcomes of the first phase of the Children's Rare Disease Cohorts initiative (CRDC) that was completed at Boston Children's Hospital (BCH). We have developed a broadly sharable database of 2441 exomes from 15 pediatric rare disease cohorts, with major contributions from early onset epilepsy and early onset inflammatory bowel disease. All sequencing data is integrated and combined with phenotypic and research data in a genomics learning system (GLS). Phenotypes were both manually annotated and pulled automatically from patient medical records. Deployment of a genomically-ordered relational database allowed us to provide a modular and robust platform for centralized storage and analysis of research and clinical data, currently totaling 8516 exomes and 112 genomes. The GLS integrates analytical systems, including machine learning algorithms for automated variant classification and prioritization, as well as phenotype extraction via natural language processing (NLP) of clinical notes. This GLS is extensible to additional analytic systems and growing research and clinical collections of genomic and other types of data.","[""1 Computational Health Informatics Program, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115 USA."", ""2 The Manton Center for Orphan Disease Research, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115 USA."", '3 Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115 USA.', ""4 Department of Neurology, F.M.

1556,Machine Learning Methods to Predict Social Media Disaster Rumor Refuters,"This research provides a general methodology for distinguishing disaster-related anti-rumor spreaders from a non-ignorant population base, with strong connections in their social circle. Several important influencing factors are examined and illustrated. User information from the most recent posted microblog content of 3793 Sina Weibo users was collected. Natural language processing (NLP) was used for the sentiment and short text similarity analyses, and four machine learning techniques, i.e., logistic regression (LR), support vector machines (SVM), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) were compared on different rumor refuting microblogs; after which a valid and robust distinguishing XGBoost model was trained and validated to predict who would retweet disaster-related rumor refuting microblogs. Compared with traditional prediction variables that only access user information, the similarity and sentiment analyses of the most recent user microblog contents were found to significantly improve prediction precision and robustness. The number of user microblogs also proved to be a valuable reference for all samples during the prediction process. This prediction methodology could be possibly more useful for WeChat or Facebook as these have relatively stable closed-loop communication channels, which means that rumors are more likely to be refuted by acquaintances. Therefore, the methodology is going to be further optimized and validated on WeChat-like channels in the future. The novel rumor refuting approach presented in this research harnessed NLP for the user microblog content analysis and then used the analysis results of NLP as additional prediction variables to identify the anti-rumor spreaders. Therefore, compared to previous studies, this study presents a new and effective decision support for rumor countermeasures.","['1 Business School, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610064, China. 18280446697@163.com.', '2 Business School, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610064, China. lizongmin@scu.edu.cn.', '3 College of Movie and Media, Sichuan Normal University, Chengdu 610064, China. honglexi@126.com.', '4 Business School, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610064, China. 13547802519@163.com.']","Shihang Wang, Zongmin Li, Yuhong Wang, Qi Zhang, ",International journal of environmental research and public health,2019,NLP; XGBoost; disaster-related; group behavior; machine learning; rumor refutation.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31022894
1557,Artificial Intelligence in Global Health -A Framework and Strategy for Adoption and Sustainability,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications in medicine have grown considerably in recent years. AI in the forms of Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Expert Systems, Planning and Logistics methods, and Image Processing networks provide great analytical aptitude. While AI methods were first conceptualized for radiology, investigations today are established across all medical specialties. The necessity for proper infrastructure, skilled labor, and access to large, well-organized data sets has kept the majority of medical AI applications in higher-income countries. However, critical technological improvements, such as cloud computing and the near-ubiquity of smartphones, have paved the way for use of medical AI applications in resource-poor areas. Global health initiatives (GHI) have already begun to explore ways to leverage medical AI technologies to detect and mitigate public health inequities. For example, AI tools can help optimize vaccine delivery and community healthcare worker routes, thus enabling limited resources to have a maximal impact. Other promising AI tools have demonstrated an ability to: predict burn healing time from smartphone photos; track regions of socioeconomic disparity combined with environmental trends to predict communicable disease outbreaks; and accurately predict pregnancy complications such as birth asphyxia in low resource settings with limited patient clinical data. In this commentary, we discuss the current state of AI-driven GHI and explore relevant lessons from past technology-centered GHI. Additionally, we propose a conceptual framework to guide the development of sustainable strategies for AI-driven GHI, and we outline areas for future research.","['1 Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77098, USA.', '2 Center of Excellence in Health Equity, Training and Research Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77098, USA.']","Trevor D Hadley, Rowland W Pettit, Tahir Malik, Amelia A Khoei, Hamisu M Salihu, ",International journal of MCH and AIDS,2020,AI Framework; AI Strategy; Artificial Intelligence; Global Health; Implementation; Sustainability.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32123635
1558,Modeling the Mental Lexicon as Part of Long-Term and Working Memory and Simulating Lexical Access in a Naming Task Including Semantic and Phonological Cues,"Background:
      
    

    
      To produce and understand words, humans access the mental lexicon. From a functional perspective, the long-term memory component of the mental lexicon is comprised of three levels: the concept level, the lemma level, and the phonological level. At each level, different kinds of word information are stored. Semantic as well as phonological cues can help to facilitate word access during a naming task, especially when neural dysfunctions are present. The processing corresponding to word access occurs in specific parts of working memory. Neural models for simulating speech processing help to uncover the complex relationships that exist between neural dysfunctions and corresponding behavioral patterns. Methods:
      
    

    
      The Neural Engineering Framework (NEF) and the Semantic Pointer Architecture (SPA) are used to develop a quantitative neural model of the mental lexicon and its access during speech processing. By simulating a picture-naming task (WWT 6-10), the influence of cues is investigated by introducing neural dysfunctions within the neural model at different levels of the mental lexicon. Results:
      
    

    
      First, the neural model is able to simulate the test behavior for normal children that exhibit no lexical dysfunction. Second, the model shows worse results in test performance as larger degrees of dysfunction are introduced. Third, if the severity of dysfunction is not too high, phonological and semantic cues are observed to lead to an increase in the number of correctly named words. Phonological cues are observed to be more effective than semantic cues. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Our simulation results are in line with human experimental data. Specifically, phonological cues seem not only to activate phonologically similar items within the phonological level. Moreover, phonological cues support higher-level processing during access of the mental lexicon. Thus, the neural model introduced in this paper offers a promising approach to modeling the mental lexicon, and to incorporating the mental lexicon into a complex model of language processing.","['1 Department for Phoniatrics, Pedaudiology, and Communication Disorders, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', '2 Applied Brain Research, Waterloo, ON, Canada.', '3 Centre for Theoretical Neuroscience, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada.']","Catharina Marie Stille, Trevor Bekolay, Peter Blouw, Bernd J Kröger, ",Frontiers in psychology,2020,behavioral testing; brain-behavior connection; computer simulations of natural language processing; neurocomputational model; phonological cues; semantic cues; spiking neural networks.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32774315
1559,Neural dynamics of sentiment processing during naturalistic sentence reading,"When we read, our eyes move through the text in a series of fixations and high-velocity saccades to extract visual information. This process allows the brain to obtain meaning, e.g., about sentiment, or the emotional valence, expressed in the written text. How exactly the brain extracts the sentiment of single words during naturalistic reading is largely unknown. This is due to the challenges of naturalistic imaging, which has previously led researchers to employ highly controlled, timed word-by-word presentations of custom reading materials that lack ecological validity. Here, we aimed to assess the electrical neural correlates of word sentiment processing during naturalistic reading of English sentences. We used a publicly available dataset of simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG), eye-tracking recordings, and word-level semantic annotations from 7129 words in 400 sentences (Zurich Cognitive Language Processing Corpus; Hollenstein et al., 2018). We computed fixation-related potentials (FRPs), which are evoked electrical responses time-locked to the onset of fixations. A general linear mixed model analysis of FRPs cleaned from visual- and motor-evoked activity showed a topographical difference between the positive and negative sentiment condition in the 224-304 ​ms interval after fixation onset in left-central and right-posterior electrode clusters. An additional analysis that included word-, phrase-, and sentence-level sentiment predictors showed the same FRP differences for the word-level sentiment, but no additional FRP differences for phrase- and sentence-level sentiment. Furthermore, decoding analysis that classified word sentiment (positive or negative) from sentiment-matched 40-trial average FRPs showed a 0.60 average accuracy (95% confidence interval: [0.58, 0.61]). Control analyses ruled out that these results were based on differences in eye movements or linguistic features other than word sentiment. Our results extend previous research by showing that the emotional valence of lexico-semantic stimuli evoke a fast electrical neural response upon word fixation during naturalistic reading. These results provide an important step to identify the neural processes of lexico-semantic processing in ecologically valid conditions and can serve to improve computer algorithms for natural language processing.","['1 Methods of Plasticity Research Laboratory, Department of Psychology, University of Zurich, Switzerland; University Research Priority Program (URPP) Dynamics of Healthy Aging, Zurich, Switzerland.

1560,Hierarchy processing in human neurobiology: how specific is it?,"Although human and non-human animals share a number of perceptual and cognitive abilities, they differ in their ability to process hierarchically structured sequences. This becomes most evident in the human capacity to process natural language characterized by structural hierarchies. This capacity is neuroanatomically grounded in the posterior part of left Broca's area (Brodmann area (BA) 44), located in the inferior frontal gyrus, and its dorsal white matter fibre connection to the temporal cortex. Within this neural network, BA 44 itself subserves hierarchy building and the strength of its connection to the temporal cortex correlates with the processing of syntactically complex sentences. Whether these brain structures are also relevant for other human cognitive abilities is a current debate. Here, this question will be evaluated with respect to those human cognitive abilities that are assumed to require hierarchy building, such as music, mathematics and Theory of Mind. Rather than supporting a domain-general view, the data indicate domain-selective neural networks as the neurobiological basis for processing hierarchy in different cognitive domains. Recent cross-species white matter comparisons suggest that particular connections within the networks may make the crucial difference in the brain structure of human and non-human primates, thereby enabling cognitive functions specific to humans.

1561,Dendritic Cell-Based Immunotherapy of Acute Myeloid Leukemia,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of blood cancer characterized by the uncontrolled clonal proliferation of myeloid hematopoietic progenitor cells in the bone marrow. The outcome of AML is poor, with five-year overall survival rates of less than 10% for the predominant group of patients older than 65 years. One of the main reasons for this poor outcome is that the majority of AML patients will relapse, even after they have attained complete remission by chemotherapy. Chemotherapy, supplemented with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients at high risk of relapse, is still the cornerstone of current AML treatment. Both therapies are, however, associated with significant morbidity and mortality. These observations illustrate the need for more effective and less toxic treatment options, especially in elderly AML and have fostered the development of novel immune-based strategies to treat AML. One of these strategies involves the use of a special type of immune cells, the dendritic cells (DCs). As central orchestrators of the immune system, DCs are key to the induction of anti-leukemia immunity. In this review, we provide an update of the clinical experience that has been obtained so far with this form of immunotherapy in patients with AML.","['1 Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Vaccine & Infectious Disease Institute, Faculty of Medicine & Health Sciences, University of Antwerp, 2610 Wilrijk, Antwerp, Belgium. heleen.vanacker@uantwerpen.be.', '2 Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Vaccine & Infectious Disease Institute, Faculty of Medicine & Health Sciences, University of Antwerp, 2610 Wilrijk, Antwerp, Belgium. maarten.versteven@uantwerpen.be.', '3 Department of Medicine III, LMU Munich, University Hospital, 80799 Munich, Germany.

1562,Neuromorphic LIF Row-by-Row Multiconvolution Processor for FPGA,"Deep Learning algorithms have become state-of-the-art methods for multiple fields, including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, and audio recognition, among others. In image vision, convolutional neural networks (CNN) stand out. This kind of network is expensive in terms of computational resources due to the large number of operations required to process a frame. In recent years, several frame-based chip solutions to deploy CNN for real time have been developed. Despite the good results in power and accuracy given by these solutions, the number of operations is still high, due the complexity of the current network models. However, it is possible to reduce the number of operations using different computer vision techniques other than frame-based, e.g., neuromorphic event-based techniques. There exist several neuromorphic vision sensors whose pixels detect changes in luminosity. Inspired in the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron, we propose in this manuscript an event-based field-programmable gate array (FPGA) multiconvolution system. Its main novelty is the combination of a memory arbiter for efficient memory access to allow row-by-row kernel processing. This system is able to convolve 64 filters across multiple kernel sizes, from 1 × 1 to 7 × 7, with latencies of 1.3 μs and 9.01 μs, respectively, generating a continuous flow of output events.

1563,The role of the arcuate and middle longitudinal fasciculi in speech perception in noise in adulthood,"In this article, we used High Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging (HARDI) with advanced anatomically constrained particle filtering tractography to investigate the role of the arcuate fasciculus (AF) and the middle longitudinal fasciculus (MdLF) in speech perception in noise in younger and older adults. Fourteen young and 15 elderly adults completed a syllable discrimination task in the presence of broadband masking noise. Mediation analyses revealed few effects of age on white matter (WM) in these fascicles but broad effects of WM on speech perception, independently of age, especially in terms of sensitivity and criterion (response bias), after controlling for individual differences in hearing sensitivity and head size. Indirect (mediated) effects of age on speech perception through WM microstructure were also found, after controlling for individual differences in hearing sensitivity and head size, with AF microstructure related to sensitivity, response bias and phonological priming, and MdLF microstructure more strongly related to response bias. These findings suggest that pathways of the perisylvian region contribute to speech processing abilities, with relatively distinct contributions for the AF (sensitivity) and MdLF (response bias), indicative of a complex contribution of both phonological and cognitive processes to age-related speech perception decline. These results provide new and important insights into the roles of these pathways as well as the factors that may contribute to elderly speech perception deficits. They also highlight the need for a greater focus to be placed on studying the role of WM microstructure to understand cognitive aging.","['1 CERVO Brain Research Center, Quebec City, Canada.', '2 Département de Réadaptation, Faculté de Médecine, Université Laval, Quebec City, Canada.', '3 Department of Speech, Hearing and Phonetic Sciences, University College London, United Kingdom.', ""4 Département d'informatique, Faculté des Sciences, Sherbrooke Connectivity Imaging Lab, Université de Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, Canada."", '5 Department of Psychology, Florida International University, Miami, Florida.']","Pascale Tremblay, Maxime Perron, Isabelle Deschamps, Dan Kennedy-Higgins, Jean-Christophe Houde, Anthony Steven Dick, Maxime Descoteaux, ",Human brain mapping,2019 Jan,HARDI; cognitive aging; diffusion MRI; hearing; language; normal aging; speech discrimination; white matter.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30277622
1564,Publicly available machine learning models for identifying opioid misuse from the clinical notes of hospitalized patients,"Background:
      
    

    
      Automated de-identification methods for removing protected health information (PHI) from the source notes of the electronic health record (EHR) rely on building systems to recognize mentions of PHI in text, but they remain inadequate at ensuring perfect PHI removal. As an alternative to relying on de-identification systems, we propose the following solutions: (1) Mapping the corpus of documents to standardized medical vocabulary (concept unique identifier [CUI] codes mapped from the Unified Medical Language System) thus eliminating PHI as inputs to a machine learning model; and (2) training character-based machine learning models that obviate the need for a dictionary containing input words/n-grams. We aim to test the performance of models with and without PHI in a use-case for an opioid misuse classifier. Methods:
      
    

    
      An observational cohort sampled from adult hospital inpatient encounters at a health system between 2007 and 2017. A case-control stratified sampling (n = 1000) was performed to build an annotated dataset for a reference standard of cases and non-cases of opioid misuse. Models for training and testing included CUI codes, character-based, and n-gram features. Models applied were machine learning with neural network and logistic regression as well as expert consensus with a rule-based model for opioid misuse. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROC) were compared between models for discrimination. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test and visual plots measured model fit and calibration. Results:
      
    

    
      Machine learning models with CUI codes performed similarly to n-gram models with PHI. The top performing models with AUROCs > 0.90 included CUI codes as inputs to a convolutional neural network, max pooling network, and logistic regression model. The top calibrated models with the best model fit were the CUI-based convolutional neural network and max pooling network. The top weighted CUI codes in logistic regression has the related terms 'Heroin' and 'Victim of abuse'. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We demonstrate good test characteristics for an opioid misuse computable phenotype that is void of any PHI and performs similarly to models that use PHI. Herein we share a PHI-free, trained opioid misuse classifier for other researchers and health systems to use and benchmark to overcome privacy and security concerns.","['1 Department of Computer Science, Loyola University Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', '2 Center for Health Outcomes and Informatics Research, Loyola University Chicago, 2160 S.

1565,Analysis of Online Reviews of Orthopaedic Surgeons and Orthopaedic Practices Using Natural Language Processing,"Background:
      
    

    
      There is growing interest in measuring and improving patient experience. Machine learning-based natural language processing techniques may help identify instructive themes in online comments written by patients about their healthcare provider. Separating individual surgeon and orthopaedic office reviews, we analyzed themes that are discussed based on the rating category, the association with review length, the number of people posting more than one review for a surgeon or office, the mean number of reviews per rating category, and the difference in review tones. Methods:
      
    

    
      On Yelp.com, we collected 11,614 free-text reviews-together with a one- to five-star rating-of orthopaedic surgeons. Using natural language processing, we identified the most frequently occurring word combinations among rating categories. Themes were derived by categorizing word combinations. Dominant tones (emotional and language styles) were assessed by the IBM Watson Tone Analyzer. We calculated chi-square tests for linear trend and Spearman's rank correlation coefficients to assess differences among rating category. Results:
      
    

    
      For individual surgeons and orthopaedic offices, themes such as logistics, care and compassion, trust, recommendation, and customer service varied among rating categories. More positive reviews are shorter for individual surgeons and orthopaedic offices, while rating category was comparable among people posting more than one review for both groups. Tones of joy and confidence were associated with higher ratings. Sadness and tentative tones were associated with lower ratings. Discussion:
      
    

    
      For individual orthopaedic surgeons and orthopaedic offices, patient experience may be influenced mostly by the patient-clinician relationship.

1566,A Real-Time Automated Patient Screening System for Clinical Trials Eligibility in an Emergency Department: Design and Evaluation,"Background:
      
    

    
      One critical hurdle for clinical trial recruitment is the lack of an efficient method for identifying subjects who meet the eligibility criteria. Given the large volume of data documented in electronic health records (EHRs), it is labor-intensive for the staff to screen relevant information, particularly within the time frame needed. To facilitate subject identification, we developed a natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning-based system, Automated Clinical Trial Eligibility Screener (ACTES), which analyzes structured data and unstructured narratives automatically to determine patients' suitability for clinical trial enrollment. In this study, we integrated the ACTES into clinical practice to support real-time patient screening. Objective:
      
    

    
      This study aimed to evaluate ACTES's impact on the institutional workflow, prospectively and comprehensively. We hypothesized that compared with the manual screening process, using EHR-based automated screening would improve efficiency of patient identification, streamline patient recruitment workflow, and increase enrollment in clinical trials. Methods:
      
    

    
      The ACTES was fully integrated into the clinical research coordinators' (CRC) workflow in the pediatric emergency department (ED) at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. The system continuously analyzed EHR information for current ED patients and recommended potential candidates for clinical trials. Relevant patient eligibility information was presented in real time on a dashboard available to CRCs to facilitate their recruitment. To assess the system's effectiveness, we performed a multidimensional, prospective evaluation for a 12-month period, including a time-and-motion study, quantitative assessments of enrollment, and postevaluation usability surveys collected from the CRCs. Results:
      
    

    
      Compared with manual screening, the use of ACTES reduced the patient screening time by 34% (P<.001). The saved time was redirected to other activities such as study-related administrative tasks (P=.03) and work-related conversations (P=.006) that streamlined teamwork among the CRCs. The quantitative assessments showed that automated screening improved the numbers of subjects screened, approached, and enrolled by 14.7%, 11.1%, and 11.1%, respectively, suggesting the potential of ACTES in streamlining recruitment workflow. Finally, the ACTES achieved a system usability scale of 80.0 in the postevaluation surveys, suggesting that it was a good computerized solution. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      By leveraging NLP and machine learning technologies, the ACTES demonstrated good capacity for improving efficiency of patient identification. The quantitative assessments demonstrated the potential of ACTES in streamlining recruitment workflow and improving patient enrollment. The postevaluation surveys suggested that the system was a good computerized solution with satisfactory usability.","[""1 Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, United States.""]","Yizhao Ni, Monica Bermudez, Stephanie Kennebeck, Stacey Liddy-Hicks, Judith Dexheimer, ",JMIR medical informatics,2019,automated patient screening; natural language processing; system integration; system usability evaluation; time and motion studies.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31342909

Here we explored the hypothesis that natural variability in facial input may delay neural commitment to face processing by testing the impact of early natural experience with siblings on infants' brain responses. Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) evoked by upright and inverted adult and child faces were compared in two groups of 10-month-old infants with (N = 21) and without (N = 22) a child sibling. In first-born infants, P1 ERP component showed specificity to upright adult faces that carried over to the subsequent N290 and P400 components. In infants with siblings no inversion effects were observed. Results are discussed in the context of evidence from the language domain, showing that neural commitment to phonetic contrasts emerges later in bilinguals than in monolinguals, and that this delay facilitates subsequent learning of previously unencountered sounds of new languages.","['1 Department of Psychology, University of Milano-Bicocca, Milano, Italy; NeuroMI, Milan Center for Neuroscience, Italy.

Thus, the Predictability of a given word has become one of the most important variables when explaining human behaviour and information processing during reading. In parallel, the Natural Language Processing (NLP) field evolved by developing a wide variety of applications. Here, we show that using different word embeddings techniques (like Latent Semantic Analysis, Word2Vec, and FastText) and N-gram-based language models we were able to estimate how humans predict words (cloze-task Predictability) and how to better understand eye movements in long Spanish texts. Both types of models partially captured aspects of predictability. On the one hand, our N-gram model performed well when added as a replacement for the cloze-task Predictability of the fixated word. On the other hand, word embeddings were useful to mimic Predictability of the following word. Our study joins efforts from neurolinguistic and NLP fields to understand human information processing during reading to potentially improve NLP algorithms.","['1 Laboratorio de Inteligencia Artificial Aplicada, Instituto de Ciencias de la Computación, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Universidad de Buenos Aires - Consejo Nacional de Investigación en Ciencia y Técnica, Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires, Argentina. bbianchi@dc.uba.ar.', '2 Laboratorio de Inteligencia Artificial Aplicada, Instituto de Ciencias de la Computación, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Universidad de Buenos Aires - Consejo Nacional de Investigación en Ciencia y Técnica, Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires, Argentina.', '3 Departamento de Computación, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires, Argentina.', '4 Departamento de Física, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires, Argentina.']","Bruno Bianchi, Gastón Bengolea Monzón, Luciana Ferrer, Diego Fernández Slezak, Diego E Shalom, Juan E Kamienkowski, ",Scientific reports,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32157161
1569,"Use of Natural Language Processing to identify Obsessive Compulsive Symptoms in patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or bipolar disorder","Obsessive and Compulsive Symptoms (OCS) or Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) in the context of schizophrenia or related disorders are of clinical importance as these are associated with a range of adverse outcomes. Natural Language Processing (NLP) applied to Electronic Health Records (EHRs) presents an opportunity to create large datasets to facilitate research in this area. This is a challenging endeavour however, because of the wide range of ways in which these symptoms are recorded, and the overlap of terms used to describe OCS with those used to describe other conditions. We developed an NLP algorithm to extract OCS information from a large mental healthcare EHR data resource at the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust using its Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) facility. We extracted documents from individuals who had received a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder. These text documents, annotated by human coders, were used for developing and refining the NLP algorithm (600 documents) with an additional set reserved for final validation (300 documents). The developed NLP algorithm utilized a rules-based approach to identify each of symptoms associated with OCS, and then combined them to determine the overall number of instances of OCS. After its implementation, the algorithm was shown to identify OCS with a precision and recall (with 95% confidence intervals) of 0.77 (0.65-0.86) and 0.67 (0.55-0.77) respectively. The development of this application demonstrated the potential to extract complex symptomatic data from mental healthcare EHRs using NLP to facilitate further analyses of these clinical symptoms and their relevance for prognosis and intervention response.","['1 Kings College London, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience, London, United Kingdom. david.chandran@kcl.ac.uk.', '2 Kings College London, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience, London, United Kingdom.', '3 University of Taipei, Department of Health and Welfare, Taipei City, Taiwan.', '4 South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom.', '5 University of Amsterdam, Department of Psychiatry, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', '6 Arkin Institute for Mental Health, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']","David Chandran, Deborah Ahn Robbins, Chin-Kuo Chang, Hitesh Shetty, Jyoti Sanyal, Johnny Downs, Marcella Fok, Michael Ball, Richard Jackson, Robert Stewart, Hannah Cohen, Jentien M Vermeulen, Frederike Schirmbeck, Lieuwe de Haan, Richard Hayes, ",Scientific reports,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31578348

      To assess documentation of urinary incontinence (UI) in prostatectomy patients using unstructured clinical notes from Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Methods:
      
    

    
      We developed a weakly-supervised natural language processing tool to extract assessments, as recorded in unstructured text notes, of UI before and after radical prostatectomy in a single academic practice across multiple clinicians. Validation was carried out using a subset of patients who completed EPIC-26 surveys before and after surgery. The prevalence of UI as assessed by EHR and EPIC-26 was compared using repeated-measures ANOVA. The agreement of reported UI between EHR and EPIC-26 was evaluated using Cohen's Kappa coefficient. Results:
      
    

    
      A total of 4870 patients and 716 surveys were included. Preoperative prevalence of UI was 12.7 percent. Postoperative prevalence was 71.8 percent at 3 months, 50.2 percent at 6 months and 34.4 and 41.8 at 12 and 24 months, respectively. Similar rates were recorded by physicians in the EHR, particularly for early follow-up. For all time points, the agreement between EPIC-26 and the EHR was moderate (all p < 0.001) and ranged from 86.7 percent agreement at baseline (Kappa = 0.48) to 76.4 percent agreement at 24 months postoperative (Kappa = 0.047). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We have developed a tool to assess documentation of UI after prostatectomy using EHR clinical notes.

At the psychological level, all text formats exhibited the predominant ""Openness"" tone, and Press releases scored higher on the scales of ""Conscientiousness"", ""Agreeableness"" and ""Emotional range"". Press releases had significantly higher scores than Scientific abstracts and Plain language summaries on the dimensions of ""Clout"", and ""Emotional tone"". Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Although the readability of Plain language summaries was higher than that of text formats targeting more expert audiences, the required literacy was much higher than the recommended US 6th grade level. The language of Press releases was generally more engaging than that of Scientific abstracts and Plain language summaries, which are written by the authors of systematic reviews. Preparation of textual summaries about health evidence for different audiences should take into account readers' subjective experiences to encourage cognitive processing and reaction to the provided information.","[""1 Croatian Association for the Promotion of Patients' Rights, Split, Croatia."", '2 School of Computer Science, Technological University Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.', '3 Cochrane Croatia and Department of Research in Biomedicine and Health, University of Split School of Medicine, Šoltanska 2, 21000, Split, Croatia.', '4 University of Split Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, Split, Croatia.', '5 Cochrane Croatia and Department of Research in Biomedicine and Health, University of Split School of Medicine, Šoltanska 2, 21000, Split, Croatia. ana.marusic@mefst.hr.']","Jasna Karačić, Pierpaolo Dondio, Ivan Buljan, Darko Hren, Ana Marušić, ",BMC medical research methodology,2019,Comprehension; Consumer health information; Health literacy; Natural language processing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30953453
1572,Identification of Patients with Heart Failure in Large Datasets,"Large registries, administrative data, and the electronic health record (EHR) offer opportunities to identify patients with heart failure, which can be used for research purposes, process improvement, and optimal care delivery. Identification of cases is challenging because of the heterogeneous nature of the disease, which encompasses various phenotypes that may respond differently to treatment. The increasing availability of both structured and unstructured data in the EHR has expanded opportunities for cohort construction. This article reviews the current literature on approaches to identification of heart failure, and looks toward the future of machine learning, big data, and phenomapping.","['1 Leon H.

1573,Implementation and comparison of two text mining methods with a standard pharmacovigilance method for signal detection of medication errors,"Background:
      
    

    
      Medication errors have been identified as the most common preventable cause of adverse events. The lack of granularity in medication error terminology has led pharmacovigilance experts to rely on information in individual case safety reports' (ICSRs) codes and narratives for signal detection, which is both time consuming and labour intensive. Thus, there is a need for complementary methods for the detection of medication errors from ICSRs. The aim of this study is to evaluate the utility of two natural language processing text mining methods as complementary tools to the traditional approach followed by pharmacovigilance experts for medication error signal detection. Methods:
      
    

    
      The safety surveillance advisor (SSA) method, I2E text mining and University of Copenhagen Center for Protein Research (CPR) text mining, were evaluated for their ability to extract cases containing a type of medication error where patients extracted insulin from a prefilled pen or cartridge by a syringe. A total of 154,209 ICSRs were retrieved from Novo Nordisk's safety database from January 1987 to February 2018. Each method was evaluated by recall (sensitivity) and precision (positive predictive value). Results:
      
    

    
      We manually annotated 2533 ICSRs to investigate whether these contained the sought medication error. All these ICSRs were then analysed using the three methods. The recall was 90.4, 88.1 and 78.5% for the CPR text mining, the SSA method and the I2E text mining, respectively. Precision was low for all three methods ranging from 3.4% for the SSA method to 1.9 and 1.6% for the CPR and I2E text mining methods, respectively. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Text mining methods can, with advantage, be used for the detection of complex signals relying on information found in unstructured text (e.g., ICSR narratives) as standardised and both less labour-intensive and time-consuming methods compared to traditional pharmacovigilance methods. The employment of text mining in pharmacovigilance need not be limited to the surveillance of potential medication errors but can be used for the ongoing regulatory requests, e.g., obligations in risk management plans and may thus be utilised broadly for signal detection and ongoing surveillance activities.","['1 Department of Safety Surveillance, Global Safety, Novo Nordisk A/S, Bagsværd, Denmark.', '2 Disease Systems Biology Program, Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark. robert.eriksson@cpr.ku.dk.', '3 Global Information & Analysis, Novo Nordisk A/S, Bagsværd, Denmark.', '4 Disease Systems Biology Program, Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', '5 Department of Safety Surveillance, Global Safety, Novo Nordisk A/S, Bagsværd, Denmark. szlh@novonordisk.com.']","Nadine Kadi Eskildsen, Robert Eriksson, Sten B Christensen, Tamilla Stine Aghassipour, Mikael Juul Bygsø, Søren Brunak, Suzanne Lisbet Hansen, ",BMC medical informatics and decision making,2020,Individual case reports; Medication errors; Natural language processing; Pharmacovigilance; Precision; Recall; Signal detection; Text mining.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32448248

1575,Parametric Modeling of Biomimetic Cortical Bone Microstructure for Additive Manufacturing,"In this work we present a novel algorithm for generating in-silico biomimetic models of a cortical bone microstructure towards manufacturing biomimetic bone via additive manufacturing. The software provides a tool for physicians or biomedical engineers to develop models of cortical bone that include the inherent complexity of the microstructure. The correspondence of the produced virtual prototypes with natural bone tissue was assessed experimentally employing Digital Light Processing (DLP) of a thermoset polymer resin to recreate healthy and osteoporotic bone tissue microstructure. The proposed tool was successfully implemented to develop cortical bone structure based on osteon density, cement line thickness, and the Haversian and Volkmann channels to produce a user-designated bone porosity that matches within values reported from literature for these types of tissues. Characterization of the specimens using a Scanning Electron Microscopy with Focused Ion Beam (SEM/FIB) and Computer Tomography (CT) revealed that the manufacturability of intricated virtual prototype is possible for scaled-up versions of the tissue. Modeling based on the density, inclination and size range of the osteon and Haversian and Volkmann´s canals granted the development of a dynamic in-silico porosity (13.37⁻21.49%) that matches with models of healthy and osteoporotic bone. Correspondence of the designed porosity with the manufactured assessment (5.79⁻16.16%) shows that the introduced methodology is a step towards the development of more refined and lifelike porous structures such as cortical bone. Further research is required for validation of the proposed methodology model of the real bone tissue and as a patient-specific customization tool of synthetic bone.","['1 Tecnologico de Monterrey, Escuela de Ingeniería y Ciencias, Ave. Eugenio Garza Sada 2501, Monterrey, N.L. 64700, Mexico. a01226825@itesm.mx.', '2 Laboratorio Nacional de Manufactura Aditiva y Digital (MADiT), Apodaca, N.L. 66629, Mexico. a01226825@itesm.mx.', '3 Tecnologico de Monterrey, Escuela de Ingeniería y Ciencias, Ave. Eugenio Garza Sada 2501, Monterrey, N.L. 64700, Mexico.

Trying to understand the psycholinguistic processing of language in its natural niche raises new issues, first and foremost the binding of multiple, temporally offset signals under tight time constraints posed by a turn-taking system. This might be expected to overload and slow our cognitive system, but the reverse is in fact the case. We propose cognitive mechanisms that may explain this phenomenon and call for a multimodal, situated psycholinguistic framework to unravel the full complexities of human language processing.","['1 Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen, The Netherlands; Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University Nijmegen, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.

1577,SAINT: Self-Attention Augmented Inception-Inside-Inception Network Improves Protein Secondary Structure Prediction,"Motivation:
      
    

    
      Protein structures provide basic insight into how they can interact with other proteins, their functions and biological roles in an organism. Experimental methods (e.g., X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy) for predicting the secondary structure (SS) of proteins are very expensive and time consuming. Therefore, developing efficient computational approaches for predicting the secondary structure of protein is of utmost importance. Advances in developing highly accurate SS prediction methods have mostly been focused on 3-class (Q3) structure prediction. However, 8-class (Q8) resolution of secondary structure contains more useful information and is much more challenging than the Q3 prediction. Results:
      
    

    
      We present SAINT, a highly accurate method for Q8 structure prediction, which incorporates self-attention mechanism (a concept from natural language processing) with the Deep Inception-Inside-Inception (Deep3I) network in order to effectively capture both the short-range and long-range interactions among the amino acid residues. SAINT offers a more interpretable framework than the typical black-box deep neural network methods. Through an extensive evaluation study, we report the performance of SAINT in comparison with the existing best methods on a collection of benchmark datasets, namely, TEST2016, TEST2018, CASP12 and CASP13. Our results suggest that self-attention mechanism improves the prediction accuracy and outperforms the existing best alternate methods. SAINT is the first of its kind and offers the best known Q8 accuracy. Thus, we believe SAINT represents a major step towards the accurate and reliable prediction of secondary structures of proteins.

      To identify the different machine learning (ML) techniques that have been applied to automate physician competence assessment and evaluate how these techniques can be used to assess different competence domains in several medical specialties. Method:
      
    

    
      In May 2017, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, PROSPERO, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched for articles published from inception to April 30, 2017. Studies were included if they applied at least one ML technique to assess medical students', residents', fellows', or attending physicians' competence. Information on sample size, participants, study setting and design, medical specialty, ML techniques, competence domains, outcomes, and methodological quality was extracted. MERSQI was used to evaluate quality, and a qualitative narrative synthesis of the medical specialties, ML techniques, and competence domains was conducted. Results:
      
    

    
      Of 4,953 initial articles, 69 met inclusion criteria. General surgery (24; 34.8%) and radiology (15; 21.7%) were the most studied specialties; natural language processing (24; 34.8%), support vector machine (15; 21.7%), and hidden Markov models (14; 20.3%) were the ML techniques most often applied; and patient care (63; 91.3%) and medical knowledge (45; 65.2%) were the most assessed competence domains. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      A growing number of studies have attempted to apply ML techniques to physician competence assessment. Although many studies have investigated the feasibility of certain techniques, more validation research is needed. The use of ML techniques may have the potential to integrate and analyze pragmatic information that could be used in real-time assessments and interventions.","[""1 R.D.

1579,Crossmodal Language Comprehension-Psycholinguistic Insights and Computational Approaches,"Crossmodal interaction in situated language comprehension is important for effective and efficient communication. The relationship between linguistic and visual stimuli provides mutual benefit: While vision contributes, for instance, information to improve language understanding, language in turn plays a role in driving the focus of attention in the visual environment. However, language and vision are two different representational modalities, which accommodate different aspects and granularities of conceptualizations. To integrate them into a single, coherent system solution is still a challenge, which could profit from inspiration by human crossmodal processing. Based on fundamental psycholinguistic insights into the nature of situated language comprehension, we derive a set of performance characteristics facilitating the robustness of language understanding, such as crossmodal reference resolution, attention guidance, or predictive processing. Artificial systems for language comprehension should meet these characteristics in order to be able to perform in a natural and smooth manner. We discuss how empirical findings on the crossmodal support of language comprehension in humans can be applied in computational solutions for situated language comprehension and how they can help to mitigate the shortcomings of current approaches.","['1 Natural Language Systems Group, Department of Informatics, University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany.', '2 Reading and Visual Cognition Lab, Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Science, Beijing, China.']","Özge Alaçam, Xingshan Li, Wolfgang Menzel, Tobias Staron, ",Frontiers in neurorobotics,2020,crossmodality; incrementality; language comprehension; prediction; psycholinguistics; speaker intention.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32116634
1580,Heart Failure Dashboard Design and Validation to Improve Care of Veterans,"Background:
      
    

    
      Early electronic identification of patients at the highest risk for heart failure (HF) readmission presents a challenge. Data needed to identify HF patients are in a variety of areas in the electronic medical record (EMR) and in different formats. Objective:
      
    

    
      The purpose of this paper is to describe the development and data validation of a HF dashboard that monitors the overall metrics of outcomes and treatments of the veteran patient population with HF and enhancing the use of guideline-directed pharmacologic therapies. Methods:
      
    

    
      We constructed a dashboard that included several data points: care assessment need score; ejection fraction (EF); medication concordance; laboratory tests; history of HF; and specified comorbidities based on International Classification of Disease (ICD), ninth and tenth codes. Data validation testing with user test scripts was utilized to ensure output accuracy of the dashboard. Nine providers and key senior management participated in data validation. Results:
      
    

    
      A total of 43 medical records were reviewed and 66 HF dashboard data discrepancies were identified during development. Discrepancies identified included: generation of multiple EF values on a few patients, missing or incorrect ICD codes, laboratory omission, incorrect medication issue dates, patients incorrectly noted as nonconcordant for medications, and incorrect dates of last cardiology appointments. Continuous integration and builds identified defects-an important process of the verification and validation of biomedical software. Data validation and technical limitations are some challenges that were encountered during dashboard development. Evaluations by testers and their focused feedback contributed to the lessons learned from the challenges. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Continuous refinement with input from multiple levels of stakeholders is crucial to development of clinically useful dashboards. Extraction of all relevant information from EMRs, including the use of natural language processing, is crucial to development of dashboards that will help improve care of individual patients and populations.","['1 Emergency Services, VA Boston Healthcare System, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.', '2 Data Management Office, VA New England Healthcare System, Bedford, Massachusetts, United States.', '3 College of Nursing and Health Sciences, University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, Massachusetts, United States.', ""4 Department of Medicine, Brigham & Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States."", '5 Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.', '6 Department of Medicine, VA Boston Healthcare System, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.', '7 Primary Care, VA New England Healthcare System, Bedford, Massachusetts, United States.', '8 Department of Cardiology, VA Boston Healthcare System, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.']","Marva Foster, Catherine Albanese, Qiang Chen, Kristen A Sethares, Stewart Evans, Lisa Soleymani Lehmann, Jacqueline Spencer, Jacob Joseph, ",Applied clinical informatics,2020 Jan,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32102107

      Cancer-initiating cell (CIC) exosomes (CIC-TEX) are suggested reprogramming Non-CIC. Mode of message transfer and engagement of CIC-markers being disputed, we elaborated the impact of CD44v6 and Tspan8 on the response of Non-CIC. Methods:
      
    

    
      Non-metastasizing CD44v6- and Tspan8-knockdown (kd) pancreatic cancer cells served as Non-CIC. CIC-TEX coculture-induced changes were evaluated by deep-sequencing and functional assays. Tumor progression was surveyed during in vivo CIC-TEX treatment. Results:
      
    

    
      Deep-sequencing of CIC-TEX-cocultured CD44v6kd-Non-CIC revealed pronounced mRNA changes in signaling, transport, transcription and translation; altered miRNA affected metabolism, signaling and transcription. CIC-TEX coculture-induced changes in Tspan8kd-Non-CIC mostly relied on CIC-TEX-Tspan8 being required for targeting. CIC-TEX transfer supported apoptosis resistance and significantly promoted epithelial mesenchymal transition, migration, invasion and (lymph)angiogenesis of the kd Non-CIC in vitro and in vivo, deep-sequencing allowing individual mRNA and miRNA assignment to altered functions. Importantly, CIC-TEX act as a hub, initiated by CD44v6-dependent RTK, GPCR and integrin activation and involving CD44v6-assisted transcription and RNA processing. Accordingly, a kinase inhibitor hampered CIC-TEX-fostered tumor progression, which was backed by an anti-Tspan8 blockade of CIC-TEX binding. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      This in depth report on the in vitro and in vivo impact of CIC-TEX on CD44v6kd and Tspan8kd Non-CIC unravels hub CIC-TEX activity, highlighting a prominent contribution of the CIC-markers CD44v6 to signaling cascade activation, transcription, translation and miRNA processing in Non-CIC and of Tspan8 to CIC-TEX targeting. Blocking CIC-TEX binding/uptake and uptake-initiated target cell activation significantly mitigated the deleterious CIC-TEX impact on CD44v6kd and Tspan8kd Non-CIC.","['1 Department of Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou, China.', '2 Pancreas Section, University Hospital of Surgery, Im Neuenheimer Feld 110, D69120, Heidelberg, Germany.', '3 Gene Core Unit, EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany.', '4 Department of Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou, China. margot.zoeller@gmx.net.', '5 Pancreas Section, University Hospital of Surgery, Im Neuenheimer Feld 110, D69120, Heidelberg, Germany. margot.zoeller@gmx.net.']","Zhe Wang, Hanxue Sun, Jan Provaznik, Thilo Hackert, Margot Zöller, ",Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,2019,CD44v6; Exosome biogenesis; Exosome message transfer; Non-cancer stem cell reprogramming; Pancreatic cancer stem cells; Tspan8.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30890157

      People with aphasia (PWA) frequently present impairments in reading comprehension. Such impairments can be particularly debilitating due to the limitations and constraints they impose on everyday life. Recent technological advancements in the field of information and communication technologies offer many compensative tools for PWA. However, most technological tools are designed for patients with speech production impairments. Instruments addressing reading impairments associated with aphasia remain scarce and underrepresented in the scientific literature. Aims:
      
    

    
      To conduct a state-of-the-art review of the technologies currently available to PWA and acquired reading impairments. In particular, this review covers (1) research on technologies explicitly developed to compensate for reading difficulties associated with aphasia; and (2) research into which accessibility features included in mainstream high-tech systems are helpful for PWA when trying to access written material.

The databases inspected were Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, the Cochrane collection, IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect and SpringerLink. Other research papers were included after checking the references of the selected papers. Main contribution:
      
    

    
      The review reveals that research on compensative devices for reading impairments largely neglects tools for individuals with aphasia and acquired reading difficulties. Most of the studies in this field are qualitative investigations of how patients with literacy difficulties tackle everyday tasks with the help of mainstream technology (e.g., smartphone applications). Therefore, this paper highlights the scarce high-tech alternatives that support text comprehension in PWA and acquired reading impairments, and suggests further work on the development of customized software for smartphones and personal computers. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      High-tech reading tools may help PWA to regain reading autonomy. PWA and acquired reading impairments employ a wide array of devices to overcome reading difficulties, which underlines the importance of reading in everyday life. However, the supports currently available are not yet flexible and accurate enough to answer their day-to-day needs. Thus, further work is necessary to enhance the compensative devices available to them. For instance, existing new technologies in the area of natural language processing (such as automatic text simplification) could potentially be used in compensative devices. What this paper adds What is already known on the subject Most research on high-tech compensative reading tools is focused on investigating how patients with aphasia and acquired reading impairments cope with their reading difficulties in everyday life by resorting to different types of technology. Yet, we still lack specific research on compensative reading technology for PWA. What this paper adds to existing knowledge This review shows that PWA with acquired reading impairments are offered limited options for accessing written content easily and autonomously-and those few resources that are available are not specifically designed for PWA. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? Both aphasia and acquired reading impairments can vary in terms of both their severity and the associated typology of cognitive impairments. Therefore, it might be interesting to investigate flexible and highly adaptable reading support designed for them-and innovations in the field of information and communication technology might prove particularly fruitful.","['1 Department of Communication and Information Technology, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, C/Tànger, 122-134, Barcelona, 08018, Spain.', '2 Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', '3 Rijndam Rehabilitation, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']","Giorgia Cistola, Mireia Farrús, Ineke van der Meulen, ",International journal of language & communication disorders,2020,acquired reading impairments; alexia; aphasia; compensative tools; natural language processing technologies.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32918536
1584,SDN2GO: An Integrated Deep Learning Model for Protein Function Prediction,"The assignment of function to proteins at a large scale is essential for understanding the molecular mechanism of life. However, only a very small percentage of the more than 179 million proteins in UniProtKB have Gene Ontology (GO) annotations supported by experimental evidence. In this paper, we proposed an integrated deep-learning-based classification model, named SDN2GO, to predict protein functions. SDN2GO applies convolutional neural networks to learn and extract features from sequences, protein domains, and known PPI networks, and then utilizes a weight classifier to integrate these features and achieve accurate predictions of GO terms. We constructed the training set and the independent test set according to the time-delayed principle of the Critical Assessment of Function Annotation (CAFA) and compared it with two highly competitive methods and the classic BLAST method on the independent test set. The results show that our method outperforms others on each sub-ontology of GO. We also investigated the performance of using protein domain information. We learned from the Natural Language Processing (NLP) to process domain information and pre-trained a deep learning sub-model to extract the comprehensive features of domains. The experimental results demonstrate that the domain features we obtained are much improved the performance of our model. Our deep learning models together with the data pre-processing scripts are publicly available as an open source software at https://github.com/Charrick/SDN2GO.","['1 School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China.', '2 School of Software, Xinjiang University, Urumqi, China.']","Yideng Cai, Jiacheng Wang, Lei Deng, ",Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology,2020,convolutional neural network; deep learning; deep multi-label classification; protein function; word embedding.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32411695
1585,Extraction and Analysis of Clinically Important Follow-up Recommendations in a Large Radiology Dataset,"Communication of follow-up recommendations when abnormalities are identified on imaging studies is prone to error. In this paper, we present a natural language processing approach based on deep learning to automatically identify clinically important recommendations in radiology reports. Our approach first identifies the recommendation sentences and then extracts reason, test, and time frame of the identified recommendations. To train our extraction models, we created a corpus of 1367 radiology reports annotated for recommendation information. Our extraction models achieved 0.93 f-score for recommendation sentence, 0.65 f-score for reason, 0.73 f-score for test, and 0.84 f-score for time frame. We applied the extraction models to a set of over 3.3 million radiology reports and analyzed the adherence of follow-up recommendations.","['1 Department of Biomedical and Health Informatics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', '2 School of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', '3 Information Technology Services, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', '4 Department of Information Sciences and Technology, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA.']","Wilson Lau, Thomas H Payne, Ozlem Uzuner, Meliha Yetisgen, ",AMIA Joint Summits on Translational Science proceedings.

1586,Fine-Tuning Bidirectional Encoder Representations From Transformers (BERT)-Based Models on Large-Scale Electronic Health Record Notes: An Empirical Study,"Background:
      
    

    
      The bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) model has achieved great success in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as named entity recognition and question answering. However, little prior work has explored this model to be used for an important task in the biomedical and clinical domains, namely entity normalization. Objective:
      
    

    
      We aim to investigate the effectiveness of BERT-based models for biomedical or clinical entity normalization. In addition, our second objective is to investigate whether the domains of training data influence the performances of BERT-based models as well as the degree of influence. Methods:
      
    

    
      Our data was comprised of 1.5 million unlabeled electronic health record (EHR) notes. We first fine-tuned BioBERT on this large collection of unlabeled EHR notes. This generated our BERT-based model trained using 1.5 million electronic health record notes (EhrBERT). We then further fine-tuned EhrBERT, BioBERT, and BERT on three annotated corpora for biomedical and clinical entity normalization: the Medication, Indication, and Adverse Drug Events (MADE) 1.0 corpus, the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) disease corpus, and the Chemical-Disease Relations (CDR) corpus. We compared our models with two state-of-the-art normalization systems, namely MetaMap and disease name normalization (DNorm). Results:
      
    

    
      EhrBERT achieved 40.95% F1 in the MADE 1.0 corpus for mapping named entities to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities and the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT), which have about 380,000 terms. In this corpus, EhrBERT outperformed MetaMap by 2.36% in F1. For the NCBI disease corpus and CDR corpus, EhrBERT also outperformed DNorm by improving the F1 scores from 88.37% and 89.92% to 90.35% and 93.82%, respectively. Compared with BioBERT and BERT, EhrBERT outperformed them on the MADE 1.0 corpus and the CDR corpus. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our work shows that BERT-based models have achieved state-of-the-art performance for biomedical and clinical entity normalization. BERT-based models can be readily fine-tuned to normalize any kind of named entities.","['1 Department of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts Lowell, Lowell, MA, United States.', '2 Center for Healthcare Organization and Implementation Research, Bedford Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Bedford, MA, United States.', '3 Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, United States.', '4 School of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, United States.']","Fei Li, Yonghao Jin, Weisong Liu, Bhanu Pratap Singh Rawat, Pengshan Cai, Hong Yu, ",JMIR medical informatics,2019,BERT; deep learning; electronic health record note; entity normalization; natural language processing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31516126
1587,Chinese clinical named entity recognition with radical-level feature and self-attention mechanism,"Named entity recognition is a fundamental and crucial task in medical natural language processing problems. In medical fields, Chinese clinical named entity recognition identifies boundaries and types of medical entities from unstructured text such as electronic medical records. Recently, a composition model of bidirectional Long Short-term Memory Networks (BiLSTMs) and conditional random field (BiLSTM-CRF) based character-level semantics has achieved great success in Chinese clinical named entity recognition tasks. But this method can only capture contextual semantics between characters in sentences. However, Chinese characters are hieroglyphics, and deeper semantic information is hidden inside, the BiLSTM-CRF model failed to get this information. In addition, some of the entities in the sentence are dependent, but the Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) does not capture long-term dependencies perfectly between characters. So we propose a BiLSTM-CRF model based on the radical-level feature and self-attention mechanism to solve these problems. We use the convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract radical-level features, aims to capture the intrinsic and internal relevances of characters. In addition, we use self-attention mechanism to capture the dependency between characters regardless of their distance. Experiments show that our model achieves F1-score 93.00% and 86.34% on CCKS-2017 and TP_CNER dataset respectively.","['1 School of Data and Computer Science, Guangdong Province Key Lab of Computational Science, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510006, PR China.

1588,Machine Learning Approaches to Analyze Speech-Evoked Neurophysiological Responses,"Purpose Speech-evoked neurophysiological responses are often collected to answer clinically and theoretically driven questions concerning speech and language processing. Here, we highlight the practical application of machine learning (ML)-based approaches to analyzing speech-evoked neurophysiological responses. Method Two categories of ML-based approaches are introduced: decoding models, which generate a speech stimulus output using the features from the neurophysiological responses, and encoding models, which use speech stimulus features to predict neurophysiological responses. In this review, we focus on (a) a decoding model classification approach, wherein speech-evoked neurophysiological responses are classified as belonging to 1 of a finite set of possible speech events (e.g., phonological categories), and (b) an encoding model temporal response function approach, which quantifies the transformation of a speech stimulus feature to continuous neural activity. Results We illustrate the utility of the classification approach to analyze early electroencephalographic (EEG) responses to Mandarin lexical tone categories from a traditional experimental design, and to classify EEG responses to English phonemes evoked by natural continuous speech (i.e., an audiobook) into phonological categories (plosive, fricative, nasal, and vowel). We also demonstrate the utility of temporal response function to predict EEG responses to natural continuous speech from acoustic features. Neural metrics from the 3 examples all exhibit statistically significant effects at the individual level. Conclusion We propose that ML-based approaches can complement traditional analysis approaches to analyze neurophysiological responses to speech signals and provide a deeper understanding of natural speech and language processing using ecologically valid paradigms in both typical and clinical populations.","['1 Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders, The University of Texas at Austin.', '2 Department of Communication Science and Disorders, School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, University of Pittsburgh.']","Zilong Xie, Rachel Reetzke, Bharath Chandrasekaran, ","Journal of speech, language, and hearing research : JSLHR",2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30950746
1589,Artificial intelligence predicts the progression of diabetic kidney disease using big data machine learning,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to support clinical judgement in medicine. We constructed a new predictive model for diabetic kidney diseases (DKD) using AI, processing natural language and longitudinal data with big data machine learning, based on the electronic medical records (EMR) of 64,059 diabetes patients. AI extracted raw features from the previous 6 months as the reference period and selected 24 factors to find time series patterns relating to 6-month DKD aggravation, using a convolutional autoencoder. AI constructed the predictive model with 3,073 features, including time series data using logistic regression analysis. AI could predict DKD aggravation with 71% accuracy. Furthermore, the group with DKD aggravation had a significantly higher incidence of hemodialysis than the non-aggravation group, over 10 years (N = 2,900). The new predictive model by AI could detect progression of DKD and may contribute to more effective and accurate intervention to reduce hemodialysis.","['1 Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Fujita Health University, Toyoake, Aichi, Japan.', '2 IBM Research, Tokyo, Japan.', '3 Business Process Planning Department, The Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company, Limited, Tokyo, Japan.', '4 IT Business Process Planning Department, The Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company, Limited, Tokyo, Japan.', '5 Division of Medical Information Systems, Fujita Health University, Toyoake, Aichi, Japan.', '6 Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Fujita Health University, Toyoake, Aichi, Japan.', '7 Department of Urology, Fujita Health University, Toyoake, Aichi, Japan.', '8 Department of Nephrology, Fujita Health University, Toyoake, Aichi, Japan.', '9 Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Fujita Health University, Toyoake, Aichi, Japan. aslapin@fujita-hu.ac.jp.']","Masaki Makino, Ryo Yoshimoto, Masaki Ono, Toshinari Itoko, Takayuki Katsuki, Akira Koseki, Michiharu Kudo, Kyoichi Haida, Jun Kuroda, Ryosuke Yanagiya, Eiichi Saitoh, Kiyotaka Hoshinaga, Yukio Yuzawa, Atsushi Suzuki, ",Scientific reports,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31413285
1590,A text mining analysis of medication quality related event reports from community pharmacies,"Background:
      
    

    
      Medication errors are estimated to cost $42 billion in annual global treatment costs. Pharmacy-based Patient Safety Organizations (PSO) are tasked with collecting and analyzing incidents, near misses, and unsafe condition reports as one way of engaging pharmacies in quality improvement efforts. Collectively, these reports are referred to as quality related events (QREs). Large-scale analysis of typed narratives from QRE reports across organizations has been a missing component of quality improvement programs. Objective:
      
    

    
      To identify topics within the components of a proposed medication safety event framework contained in the free-text narrative of QRE reports. Methods:
      
    

    
      A retrospective, observational analysis of data from a PSOs voluntary reporting system, from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2014. The dataset contained structured and unstructured data elements. A structural topic model extracted themes from the free-text narrative component of the report. These topics were assigned a human label and mapped onto constructs of the medication safety event framework. Results:
      
    

    
      A total of 531,555 QREs were analyzed from 1660 pharmacies. 90.6% were near miss and unsafe condition reports. There were 40 topics generated. There were 29 topics identified as QRE types, 3 were identified as contributing factors, and 5 were related to signals/alerts that an incident or near miss had occurred. One topic each was identified as a recovery step and a quality improvement strategy. One topic was not assigned a human label. Examples of topics labeled included incorrect tapering directions, needing to double-check work, and attention-related contributing factor. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The free-text narrative provided novel information compared to the structured fields of the reports. Topics were mapped onto a proposed medication safety event framework to advance knowledge of medication QREs and identify ways to improve medication safety in community pharmacy. Future work may focus on communicating these topics to the pharmacies to improve medication safety efforts.","['1 University of Michigan, College of Pharmacy, United States.

1591,Investigating the Attitudes of Adolescents and Young Adults Towards JUUL: Computational Study Using Twitter Data,"Background:
      
    

    
      Increases in electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) use among high school students from 2017 to 2019 appear to be associated with the increasing popularity of the ENDS device JUUL. Objective:
      
    

    
      We employed a content analysis approach in conjunction with natural language processing methods using Twitter data to understand salient themes regarding JUUL use on Twitter, sentiment towards JUUL, and underage JUUL use. Methods:
      
    

    
      Between July 2018 and August 2019, 11,556 unique tweets containing a JUUL-related keyword were collected. We manually annotated 4000 tweets for JUUL-related themes of use and sentiment. We used 3 machine learning algorithms to classify positive and negative JUUL sentiments as well as underage JUUL mentions. Results:
      
    

    
      Of the annotated tweets, 78.80% (3152/4000) contained a specific mention of JUUL. Only 1.43% (45/3152) of tweets mentioned using JUUL as a method of smoking cessation, and only 6.85% (216/3152) of tweets mentioned the potential health effects of JUUL use. Of the machine learning methods used, the random forest classifier was the best performing algorithm among all 3 classification tasks (ie, positive sentiment, negative sentiment, and underage JUUL mentions). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our findings suggest that a vast majority of Twitter users are not using JUUL to aid in smoking cessation nor do they mention the potential health benefits or detriments of JUUL use. Using machine learning algorithms to identify tweets containing underage JUUL mentions can support the timely surveillance of JUUL habits and opinions, further assisting youth-targeted public health intervention strategies.","['1 Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, United States.', '2 Department of Biomedical Informatics and Medical Education, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States.', '3 University Information Technology Infrastructure and Operations, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, United States.', '4 Department of Family Medicine & Public Health, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States.']","Ryzen Benson, Mengke Hu, Annie T Chen, Subhadeep Nag, Shu-Hong Zhu, Mike Conway, ",JMIR public health and surveillance,2020,ENDS; JUUL; NLP; Twitter; e-cig; electronic cigarettes; electronic nicotine delivery system; infodemiology; infoveillance; machine learning; natural language processing; public health; smoking cessation; social media; tobacco; underage tobacco use.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32876579
1592,Deconstructing Procedural Memory: Different Learning Trajectories and Consolidation of Sequence and Statistical Learning,"Procedural learning is a fundamental cognitive function that facilitates efficient processing of and automatic responses to complex environmental stimuli. Here, we examined training-dependent and off-line changes of two sub-processes of procedural learning: namely, sequence learning and statistical learning. Whereas sequence learning requires the acquisition of order-based relationships between the elements of a sequence, statistical learning is based on the acquisition of probabilistic associations between elements. Seventy-eight healthy young adults (58 females and 20 males) completed the modified version of the Alternating Serial Reaction Time task that was designed to measure Sequence and Statistical Learning simultaneously. After training, participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: active wakefulness, quiet rest, or daytime sleep. We examined off-line changes in Sequence and Statistical Learning as well as further improvements after extended practice. Performance in Sequence Learning increased during training, while Statistical Learning plateaued relatively rapidly. After the off-line period, both the acquired sequence and statistical knowledge was preserved, irrespective of the vigilance state (awake, quiet rest or sleep). Sequence Learning further improved during extended practice, while Statistical Learning did not. Moreover, within the sleep group, cortical oscillations and sleep spindle parameters showed differential associations with Sequence and Statistical Learning. Our findings can contribute to a deeper understanding of the dynamic changes of multiple parallel learning and consolidation processes that occur during procedural memory formation.","['1 Institute of Psychology, ELTE Eötvös Loránd University, Budapest, Hungary.', '2 Institute of Behavioural Sciences, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', '3 Doctoral School of Psychology, ELTE Eötvös Loránd University, Budapest, Hungary.', '4 MTA-ELTE NAP Brain, Memory and Language Research Group, Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience and Psychology, Research Centre for Natural Sciences, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Budapest, Hungary.', '5 Department of General Psychology, Pázmány Péter Catholic University, Budapest, Hungary.', '6 MTA-PPKE Adolescent Development Research Group, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Budapest, Hungary.', '7 Lyon Neuroscience Research Center (CRNL), Université de Lyon, Lyon, France.']","Peter Simor, Zsofia Zavecz, Kata Horváth, Noémi Éltető, Csenge Török, Orsolya Pesthy, Ferenc Gombos, Karolina Janacsek, Dezso Nemeth, ",Frontiers in psychology,2019,EEG; consolidation; procedural learning; sequence learning; sleep; statistical learning.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30687169
1593,Capsule Networks Showed Excellent Performance in the Classification of hERG Blockers/Nonblockers,"Capsule networks (CapsNets), a new class of deep neural network architectures proposed recently by Hinton et al., have shown a great performance in many fields, particularly in image recognition and natural language processing. However, CapsNets have not yet been applied to drug discovery-related studies. As the first attempt, we in this investigation adopted CapsNets to develop classification models of hERG blockers/nonblockers; drugs with hERG blockade activity are thought to have a potential risk of cardiotoxicity. Two capsule network architectures were established: convolution-capsule network (Conv-CapsNet) and restricted Boltzmann machine-capsule networks (RBM-CapsNet), in which convolution and a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) were used as feature extractors, respectively. Two prediction models of hERG blockers/nonblockers were then developed by Conv-CapsNet and RBM-CapsNet with the Doddareddy's training set composed of 2,389 compounds. The established models showed excellent performance in an independent test set comprising 255 compounds, with prediction accuracies of 91.8 and 92.2% for Conv-CapsNet and RBM-CapsNet models, respectively. Various comparisons were also made between our models and those developed by other machine learning methods including deep belief network (DBN), convolutional neural network (CNN), multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), logistic regression (LR), and LightGBM, and with different training sets. All the results showed that the models by Conv-CapsNet and RBM-CapsNet are among the best classification models.

1594,Learning to detect and understand drug discontinuation events from clinical narratives,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Identifying drug discontinuation (DDC) events and understanding their reasons are important for medication management and drug safety surveillance. Structured data resources are often incomplete and lack reason information. In this article, we assessed the ability of natural language processing (NLP) systems to unlock DDC information from clinical narratives automatically. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      We collected 1867 de-identified providers' notes from the University of Massachusetts Medical School hospital electronic health record system. Then 2 human experts chart reviewed those clinical notes to annotate DDC events and their reasons. Using the annotated data, we developed and evaluated NLP systems to automatically identify drug discontinuations and reasons at the sentence level using a novel semantic enrichment-based vector representation (SEVR) method for enhanced feature representation. Results:
      
    

    
      Our SEVR-based NLP system achieved the best performance of 0.785 (AUC-ROC) for detecting discontinuation events and 0.745 (AUC-ROC) for identifying reasons when testing this highly imbalanced data, outperforming 2 state-of-the-art non-SEVR-based models. Compared with a rule-based baseline system for discontinuation detection, our system improved the sensitivity significantly (57.75% vs 18.31%, absolute value) while retaining a high specificity of 99.25%, leading to a significant improvement in AUC-ROC by 32.83% (absolute value). Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Experiments have shown that a high-performance NLP system can be developed to automatically identify DDCs and their reasons from providers' notes. The SEVR model effectively improved the system performance showing better generalization and robustness on unseen test data. Our work is an important step toward identifying reasons for drug discontinuation that will inform drug safety surveillance and pharmacovigilance.","['1 Department of Population and Quantitative Health Sciences, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts, USA.', '2 Bedford VA Medical Center, Bedford, Massachusetts, USA.', '3 Department of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts Lowell, Lowell, Massachusetts, USA.', '4 Departments of Internal Medicine and Biomedical Informatics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.', '5 Department of Veterans Affairs Pharmacy Benefits Management Services, Hines, Illinois, USA.', '6 Informatics, Decision-Enhancement, and Analytic Sciences Center (IDEAS 2.0), VA Salt Lake City Health Care System, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.', '7 Division of Epidemiology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.', '8 Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts, USA.', '9 Department of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, Massachusetts, USA.']","Feifan Liu, Richeek Pradhan, Emily Druhl, Elaine Freund, Weisong Liu, Brian C Sauer, Fran Cunningham, Adam J Gordon, Celena B Peters, Hong Yu, ",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2019,drug surveillance; electronic health records; knowledge representation; natural language processing; supervised machine learning.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31034028
1595,"Efficient and Accurate Extracting of Unstructured EHRs on Cancer Therapy Responses for the Development of RECIST Natural Language Processing Tools: Part I, the Corpus","Purpose:
      
    

    
      Electronic health records (EHRs) are created primarily for nonresearch purposes; thus, the amounts of data are enormous, and the data are crude, heterogeneous, incomplete, and largely unstructured, presenting challenges to effective analyses for timely, reliable results. Particularly, research dealing with clinical notes relevant to patient care and outcome is seldom conducted, due to the complexity of data extraction and accurate annotation in the past. RECIST is a set of widely accepted research criteria to evaluate tumor response in patients undergoing antineoplastic therapy. The aim for this study was to identify textual sources for RECIST information in EHRs and to develop a corpus of pharmacotherapy and response entities for development of natural language processing tools. Methods:
      
    

    
      We focused on pharmacotherapies and patient responses, using 55,120 medical notes (n = 72 types) in Mayo Clinic's EHRs from 622 randomly selected patients who signed authorization for research. Using the Multidocument Annotation Environment tool, we applied and evaluated predefined keywords, and time interval and note-type filters for identifying RECIST information and established a gold standard data set for patient outcome research. Results:
      
    

    
      Key words reduced clinical notes to 37,406, and using four note types within 12 months postdiagnosis further reduced the number of notes to 5,005 that were manually annotated, which covered 97.9% of all cases (n = 609 of 622). The resulting data set of 609 cases (n = 503 for training and n = 106 for validation purpose), contains 736 fully annotated, deidentified clinical notes, with pharmacotherapies and four response end points: complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease. This resource is readily expandable to specific drugs, regimens, and most solid tumors. Conclusion:

      Twenty-one healthy elderly adults and 21 healthy younger adults were recruited to conduct a dynamic hand-held tool recognition task with high/low-intensity stimuli. Results:
      
    

    
      Elderly adults exhibited higher areas under the curve for both the high-intensity (3.5 versus. 2.7) and low-intensity (3.0 versus. 1.2) stimuli, indicating a higher audio-visual integration ability, but a delayed and widened audio-visual integration window for elderly adults for both the high-intensity (390 - 690 ms versus. 360 - 560 ms) and low-intensity (460 - 690 ms versus. 430 - 500 ms) stimuli. Additionally, elderly adults exhibited higher theta-band (all p < .01) but lower alpha-, beta-, and gamma-band functional connectivity (all p < .05) than younger adults under both the high- and low-intensity-stimulus conditions when processing audio-visual stimuli, except for gamma-band functional connectivity under the high-intensity-stimulus condition. Furthermore, higher theta- and alpha-band functional connectivity were observed for the audio-visual stimuli than for the auditory and visual stimuli and under the high-intensity-stimulus condition than under the low-intensity-stimulus condition. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The higher theta-band functional connectivity in elderly adults was mainly due to higher attention allocation. The results further suggested that in the case of sensory processing, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma activity might participate in different stages of perception.","['1 Department of Psychology, College of Humanities and Management, Guizhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guiyang, China.', '2 Department of Psychology, Faculty of Education, Hubei University, Wuhan, China.', '3 Department of Foreign Language, Ningbo University of Technology, Zhejiang, China.', '4 Department of Light and Chemical Engineering, Guizhou Light Industry Technical College, Guiyang, China.']","Yanna Ren, Ao Guo, Zhihan Xu, Tao Wang, Rui Wu, Weiping Yang, ",Brain and behavior,2020,audio-visual integration; functional connectivity; hand-held tool recognition; phase lag index; stimulus intensity.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32683799
1597,Changes in Mortality Involving Extended-Release and Long-Acting Opioids After Implementation of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy,"Objective:
      
    

    
      To assess changes in mortality rates in extended-release and long-acting (ER/LA) opioid analgesics after the implementation of the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). Setting:
      
    

    
      All drug poisoning deaths in three states: Florida, Oregon, and Washington. Data were obtained through state vital records offices and the Researched Abuse, Diversion and Addiction-Related Surveillance System Medical Examiner Program. Methods:
      
    

    
      Using cause-of-death literal text from death certificates, individual opioid active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) involved in each death were identified using rules-based natural language processing. Population-adjusted and prescriptions dispensed-adjusted mortality rates were calculated for all ER/LA opioid analgesic and individual opioid APIs. Rates before and after implementation of the REMS were compared. Rate changes were compared with rates from two APIs with little or no inclusion in the REMS: benzodiazepines and hydrocodone. Results:
      
    

    
      The mean ER/LA opioid analgesic population-adjusted mortality rate significantly decreased in all three states (FL: P = 0.003; OR: P = 0.003; WA: P < 0.001). Mortality rates for benzodiazepines and hydrocodone also decreased and were not statistically different. Significant heterogeneity in mortality rates of individual opioids was observed between the three states. When adjusted for prescription volume, the ER/LA opioid analgesic mortality rate decreased in all three states, but was significant only for Washington (P < 0.001). Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The population-adjusted mortality rate of ER/LA opioid analgesics has decreased in three states. Notably, the contributions to mortality rates by individual opioid analgesics were not uniform across the three states in this study. However, these changes were not generally distinct from changes in mortality rates where comparator substances were involved.","['1 Rocky Mountain Poison & Drug Center, Denver Health and Hospital Authority, Denver, Colorado.', '2 Janssen Pharmaceutical Research & Development LLC, Titusville, New Jersey.', '3 Upsher-Smith Laboratories, LLC, Maple Grove, Minnesota.', '4 Inflexxion, Inc., Waltham, Massachusetts, USA.']","Joshua C Black, Gabrielle E Bau, Travis Rosen, M Soledad Cepeda, Gregory P Wedin, Jody L Green, Richard C Dart, ","Pain medicine (Malden, Mass.)",2020,ER/LA; Mortality; Opioid Analgesics; Prescription Drug Abuse; REMS.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30877807
1598,Developing a FHIR-based EHR phenotyping framework: A case study for identification of patients with obesity and multiple comorbidities from discharge summaries,"Background:
      
    

    
      Standards-based clinical data normalization has become a key component of effective data integration and accurate phenotyping for secondary use of electronic healthcare records (EHR) data. HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is an emerging clinical data standard for exchanging electronic healthcare data and has been used in modeling and integrating both structured and unstructured EHR data for a variety of clinical research applications. The overall objective of this study is to develop and evaluate a FHIR-based EHR phenotyping framework for identification of patients with obesity and its multiple comorbidities from semi-structured discharge summaries leveraging a FHIR-based clinical data normalization pipeline (known as NLP2FHIR). Methods:
      
    

    
      We implemented a multi-class and multi-label classification system based on the i2b2 Obesity Challenge task to evaluate the FHIR-based EHR phenotyping framework. Two core parts of the framework are: (a) the conversion of discharge summaries into corresponding FHIR resources - Composition, Condition, MedicationStatement, Procedure and FamilyMemberHistory using the NLP2FHIR pipeline, and (b) the implementation of four machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tree, and random forest) to train classifiers to predict disease state of obesity and 15 comorbidities using features extracted from standard FHIR resources and terminology expansions. We used the macro- and micro-averaged precision (P), recall (R), and F1 score (F1) measures to evaluate the classifier performance. We validated the framework using a second obesity dataset extracted from the MIMIC-III database. Results:
      
    

    
      Using the NLP2FHIR pipeline, 1237 clinical discharge summaries from the 2008 i2b2 obesity challenge dataset were represented as the instances of the FHIR Composition resource consisting of 5677 records with 16 unique section types. After the NLP processing and FHIR modeling, a set of 244,438 FHIR clinical resource instances were generated. As the results of the four machine learning classifiers, the random forest algorithm performed the best with F1-micro(0.9466)/F1-macro(0.7887) and F1-micro(0.9536)/F1-macro(0.6524) for intuitive classification (reflecting medical professionals' judgments) and textual classification (reflecting the judgments based on explicitly reported information of diseases), respectively. The MIMIC-III obesity dataset was successfully integrated for prediction with minimal configuration of the NLP2FHIR pipeline and machine learning models. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The study demonstrated that the FHIR-based EHR phenotyping approach could effectively identify the state of obesity and multiple comorbidities using semi-structured discharge summaries. Our FHIR-based phenotyping approach is a first concrete step towards improving the data aspect of phenotyping portability across EHR systems and enhancing interpretability of the machine learning-based phenotyping algorithms.","['1 Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', '2 Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', '3 Weill Cornell Medicine, New York City, NY, USA.', '4 Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.

1599,Prediction of Pancreatic Cancer Based on Imaging Features in Patients With Duct Abnormalities,"Objectives:
      
    

    
      Abnormalities of the main pancreatic duct may be an early indicator of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We develop and validate algorithms that predict the risk of PDAC using features identified on cross-sectional imaging and other clinical characteristics collected through electronic medical records. Methods:
      
    

    
      Adult patients with abdominal computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging in January 2006 to June 2016 demonstrating dilatation of main pancreatic duct were identified. Pancreas-related morphologic features were extracted from radiology reports using natural language processing. The cumulative incidence of PDAC with death as a competing risk was estimated using multistate models. Model discrimination was assessed using c-index. The models were internally validated using bootstrapping. Results:
      
    

    
      The cohort consisted of 7819 patients (mean age, 71 years; 65% female). A total of 781 patients (10%) developed PDAC within 3 years after the first eligible imaging study. The final models achieved reasonable discrimination (c-index, 0.825-0.833). The 3-year average risk of PDAC in the top 5% of the total eligible patients was 56.0%, more than 20 times of the average risk among the bottom 50% of patients. Conclusions:

1600,Natural Language Processing Tools for Assessing Progress and Outcome of Two Veteran Populations: Cohort Study From a Novel Online Intervention for Posttraumatic Growth,"Background:
      
    

    
      Over 100 million Americans lack affordable access to behavioral health care. Among these, military veterans are an especially vulnerable population. Military veterans require unique behavioral health services that can address military experiences and challenges transitioning to the civilian sector. Real-world programs to help veterans successfully transition to civilian life must build a sense of community, have the ability to scale, and be able to reach the many veterans who cannot or will not access care. Digitally based behavioral health initiatives have emerged within the past few years to improve this access to care. Our novel behavioral health intervention teaches mindfulness-based cognitive behavioral therapy and narrative therapy using peer support groups as guides, with human-facilitated asynchronous online discussions. Our study applies natural language processing (NLP) analytics to assess effectiveness of our online intervention in order to test whether NLP may provide insights and detect nuances of personal change and growth that are not currently captured by subjective symptom measures. Objective:
      
    

    
      This paper aims to study the value of NLP analytics in assessing progress and outcomes among combat veterans and military sexual assault survivors participating in novel online interventions for posttraumatic growth. Methods:
      
    

    
      IBM Watson and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count tools were applied to the narrative writings of combat veterans and survivors of military sexual trauma who participated in novel online peer-supported group therapies for posttraumatic growth. Participants watched videos, practiced skills such as mindfulness meditation, told their stories through narrative writing, and participated in asynchronous, facilitated online discussions with peers. The writings, including online postings, by the 16 participants who completed the program were analyzed after completion of the program. Results:
      
    

    
      Our results suggest that NLP can provide valuable insights on shifts in personality traits, personal values, needs, and emotional tone in an evaluation of our novel online behavioral health interventions. Emotional tone analysis demonstrated significant decreases in fear and anxiety, sadness, and disgust, as well as increases in joy. Significant effects were found for personal values and needs, such as needing or desiring closeness and helping others, and for personality traits of openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism (ie, emotional range). Participants also demonstrated increases in authenticity and clout (confidence) of expression. NLP results were generally supported by qualitative observations and analysis, structured data, and course feedback. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The aggregate of results in our study suggest that our behavioral health intervention was effective and that NLP can provide valuable insights on shifts in personality traits, personal values, and needs, as well as measure changes in emotional tone. NLP's sensitivity to changes in emotional tone, values, and personality strengths suggests the efficacy of NLP as a leading indicator of treatment progress.","['1 Young Adult and Family Center, UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences, University of California, San Francisco, CA, United States.', '2 IBM Watson Health, IBM Corporation, Palo Alto, CA, United States.', '3 Tiatros, Inc, San Francisco, CA, United States.']","Kim P Norman, Anita Govindjee, Seth R Norman, Michael Godoy, Kimberlie L Cerrone, Dustin W Kieschnick, William Kassler, ",JMIR formative research,2020,PTSD; emotional tone; internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy; military sexual trauma; mindfulness; narrative therapy; natural language analysis; online interventions; personality; values.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32769074
1601,External Validation of an Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Prediction Model Using Radiology Reports,"Objectives:
      
    

    
      Acute respiratory distress syndrome is frequently under recognized and associated with increased mortality. Previously, we developed a model that used machine learning and natural language processing of text from radiology reports to identify acute respiratory distress syndrome. The model showed improved performance in diagnosing acute respiratory distress syndrome when compared to a rule-based method. In this study, our objective was to externally validate the natural language processing model in patients from an independent hospital setting. Design:
      
    

    
      Secondary analysis of data across five prospective clinical studies. Setting:
      
    

    
      An urban, tertiary care, academic hospital. Patients:
      
    

    
      Adult patients admitted to the medical ICU and at-risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome. Interventions:
      
    

    
      None. Measurements and main results:
      
    

    
      The natural language processing model was previously derived and internally validated in burn, trauma, and medical patients at Loyola University Medical Center. Two machine learning models were examined with the following text features from qualifying radiology reports: 1) word representations (n-grams) and 2) standardized clinical named entity mentions mapped from the National Library of Medicine Unified Medical Language System. The models were externally validated in a cohort of 235 patients at the University of Chicago Medicine, among which 110 (47%) were diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome by expert annotation. During external validation, the n-gram model demonstrated good discrimination between acute respiratory distress syndrome and nonacute respiratory distress syndrome patients (C-statistic, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.72-0.84). The n-gram model had a higher discrimination for acute respiratory distress syndrome when compared with the standardized named entity model, although not statistically significant (C-statistic 0.78 vs 0.72; p = 0.09). The most important features in the model had good face validity for acute respiratory distress syndrome characteristics but differences in frequencies did occur between hospital settings. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our computable phenotype for acute respiratory distress syndrome had good discrimination in external validation and may be used by other health systems for case-identification. Discrepancies in feature representation are likely due to differences in characteristics of the patient cohorts.","['1 University of Chicago, Chicago, IL.', '2 Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, IL.']","Anoop Mayampurath, Matthew M Churpek, Xin Su, Sameep Shah, Elizabeth Munroe, Bhakti Patel, Dmitriy Dligach, Majid Afshar, ",Critical care medicine,2020 Sep,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32590389
1602,Potential of infrared microscopy to differentiate between dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's diseases using peripheral blood samples and machine learning algorithms,"Significance:
      
    

    
      Accurate and objective identification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is of major clinical importance due to the current lack of low-cost and noninvasive diagnostic tools to differentiate between the two. Developing an approach for such identification can have a great impact in the field of dementia diseases as it would offer physicians a routine objective test to support their diagnoses. The problem is especially acute because these two dementias have some common symptoms and characteristics, which can lead to misdiagnosis of DLB as AD and vice versa, mainly at their early stages. Aim:
      
    

    
      The aim is to evaluate the potential of mid-infrared (IR) spectroscopy in tandem with machine learning algorithms as a sensitive method to detect minor changes in the biochemical structures that accompany the development of AD and DLB based on a simple peripheral blood test, thus improving the diagnostic accuracy of differentiation between DLB and AD. Approach:
      
    

    
      IR microspectroscopy was used to examine white blood cells and plasma isolated from 56 individuals: 26 controls, 20 AD patients, and 10 DLB patients. The measured spectra were analyzed via machine learning. Results:
      
    

    
      Our encouraging results show that it is possible to differentiate between dementia (AD and DLB) and controls with an ∼86 % success rate and between DLB and AD patients with a success rate of better than 93%. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The success of this method makes it possible to suggest a new, simple, and powerful tool for the mental health professional, with the potential to improve the reliability and objectivity of diagnoses of both AD and DLB.","['1 Shamoon College of Engineering, Department of Physics, Beer-Sheva, Israel.', '2 Afeka Tel-Aviv Academic College of Engineering, Afeka Center for Language Processing, Department of, Israel.', '3 Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Department of Physics, Faculty of Natural Sciences, Beer-Sheva, Israel.', '4 The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, School of Nutritional Sciences, The Robert H.

1603,AVADA: toward automated pathogenic variant evidence retrieval directly from the full-text literature,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      Both monogenic pathogenic variant cataloging and clinical patient diagnosis start with variant-level evidence retrieval followed by expert evidence integration in search of diagnostic variants and genes. Here, we try to accelerate pathogenic variant evidence retrieval by an automatic approach. Methods:
      
    

    
      Automatic VAriant evidence DAtabase (AVADA) is a novel machine learning tool that uses natural language processing to automatically identify pathogenic genetic variant evidence in full-text primary literature about monogenic disease and convert it to genomic coordinates. Results:
      
    

    
      AVADA automatically retrieved almost 60% of likely disease-causing variants deposited in the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD), a 4.4-fold improvement over the current best open source automated variant extractor. AVADA contains over 60,000 likely disease-causing variants that are in HGMD but not in ClinVar. AVADA also highlights the challenges of automated variant mapping and pathogenicity curation. However, when combined with manual validation, on 245 diagnosed patients, AVADA provides valuable evidence for an additional 18 diagnostic variants, on top of ClinVar's 21, versus only 2 using the best current automated approach. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      AVADA advances automated retrieval of pathogenic monogenic variant evidence from full-text literature. Far from perfect, but much faster than PubMed/Google Scholar search, careful curation of AVADA-retrieved evidence can aid both database curation and patient diagnosis.","['1 Department of Computer Science, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', '2 Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', '3 Institute of Medical Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Heath Park, Cardiff, UK.', '4 Department of Pediatrics, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', '5 Santa Cruz Genomics Institute, MS CBSE, University of California Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA, USA.', '6 Department of Computer Science, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. bejerano@stanford.edu.', '7 Department of Pediatrics, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA. bejerano@stanford.edu.', '8 Department of Developmental Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. bejerano@stanford.edu.', '9 Department of Biomedical Data Science, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. bejerano@stanford.edu.']","Johannes Birgmeier, Cole A Deisseroth, Laura E Hayward, Luisa M T Galhardo, Andrew P Tierno, Karthik A Jagadeesh, Peter D Stenson, David N Cooper, Jonathan A Bernstein, Maximilian Haeussler, Gill Bejerano, ",Genetics in medicine : official journal of the American College of Medical Genetics,2020 Feb,automatic variant retrieval; full-text extraction; machine learning; natural language processing; variants database.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31467448
1604,Integration of physical abuse clinical decision support at 2 general emergency departments,"Objective:
      
    

    
      The study sought to develop and evaluate an electronic health record-based child abuse clinical decision support system in 2 general emergency departments. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      A combination of a child abuse screen, natural language processing, physician orders, and discharge diagnoses were used to identify children <2 years of age with injuries suspicious for physical abuse. Providers received an alert and were referred to a physical abuse order set whenever a child triggered the system. Physician compliance with clinical guidelines was compared before and during the intervention. Results:
      
    

    
      A total of 242 children triggered the system, 86 during the preintervention and 156 during the intervention. The number of children identified with suspicious injuries increased 4-fold during the intervention (P < .001). Compliance was 70% (7 of 10) in the preintervention period vs 50% (22 of 44) in the intervention, a change that was not statistically different (P = .55). Fifty-two percent of providers said that receiving the alert changed their clinical decision making. There was no relationship between compliance and provider or patient demographics. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      A multifaceted child abuse clinical decision support system resulted in a marked increase in the number of young children identified as having injuries suspicious for physical abuse in 2 general emergency departments. Compliance with published guidelines did not change; we hypothesize that this is related to the increased number of children identified with suspicious, but less serious injuries. These injuries were likely missed preintervention. Tracking compliance with guidelines over time will be important to assess whether compliance increases as physician comfort with evaluation of suspected physical abuse in young children improves.","[""1 Department of Pediatrics, UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA."", '2 Department of Medicine, Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine, Manhasset, New York, USA.', '3 Statistical Analysis and Measurement Consultants, Lanexa, VA.']","Bruce Rosenthal, Janet Skrbin, Janet Fromkin, Emily Heineman, Tom McGinn, Rudolph Richichi, Rachel P Berger, ",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2019,child maltreatment; electronic health record; pediatric.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31197358
1605,Articles with impact: insights into 10 years of research with machine learning,"Worldwide scientific output is growing faster and faster. Academics should not only publish much and fast, but also publish research with impact. The aim of this study is to use machine learning to investigate characteristics of articles that were published in the Journal of Applied Physiology between 2009 and 2018, and characterize high-impact articles. Article impact was assessed for 4,531 publications by three common impact metrics: the Altmetric Attention Scores, downloads and citations. Additionally, a broad collection of (more than 200) characteristics was collected from the article's title, abstract, authors, keywords, publication, and article engagement. We constructed random forest (RF) regression models to predict article impact and articles with the highest impact (top-25% and top-10% for each impact metric), which were compared to a naïve baseline method. RF models outperformed the baseline models when predicting the impact of unseen articles (p<0.001 for each impact metric). Also, RF models predicted top-25% and top-10% high-impact articles with a high accuracy. Moreover, RF models revealed important article characteristics. Higher impact was observed for articles about exercise, training, performance and V̇O2max, reviews, human studies, articles from large collaborations, longer articles with many references and high engagement by scientists, practitioners and public or via news outlets and videos. Lower impact was shown for articles about respiratory physiology or sleep apnea, editorials, animal studies, and titles with a question mark or a reference to places or individuals. In summary, research impact can be predicted and better understood using a combination of article characteristics and machine learning.","['1 Department of Human Movement Sciences, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Netherlands.', '2 Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science, Leiden University, Netherlands.', '3 Department of Internal Medicine, Endocrinology and Metabolism, University of Iowa, United States.']","Stephan van der Zwaard, Arie-Willem de Leeuw, L Rens A Meerhoff, Sue C Bodine, Arno Knobbe, ","Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)",2020,Altmetrics; Bibliometrics; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Scientometrics.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32790596
1606,Perspective: Towards Automated Tracking of Content and Evidence Appraisal of Nutrition Research,"Robust recommendations for healthy diets and nutrition require careful synthesis of available evidence. Given the increasing volume of research articles generated, the retrieval and synthesis of evidence are increasingly becoming laborious and time-consuming. Information technology could help to reduce workload for humans. To guide supervised learning however, human identification of key study characteristics is necessary. Reporting guidelines recommend that authors include essential content in articles and could generate manually labeled training data for automated evidence retrieval and synthesis. Here, we present a semiautomated approach to annotate, link, and track the content of nutrition research manuscripts. We used the STROBE extension for nutritional epidemiology (STROBE-nut) reporting guidelines to manually annotate a sample of 15 articles and converted the semantic information into linked data in a Neo4j graph database through an automated process. Six summary statistics were computed to estimate the reporting completeness of the articles. The content structure, presence of essential study characteristics as well as the reporting completeness of the articles are visualized automatically from the graph database. The archived linked data are interoperable through their annotations and relations. A graph database with linked data on essential study characteristics can enable Natural Language Processing in nutrition.","['1 Department of Food Technology, Safety and Health, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', '2 KERMIT (Research Unit of Knowledge-based Systems), Department of Data Analysis and Mathematical Modelling, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', '3 Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research, Zeist, The Netherlands.']","Chen Yang, Dana Hawwash, Bernard De Baets, Jildau Bouwman, Carl Lachat, ","Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2020,STROBE-nut; graph database; ontology; reporting guidelines; research semantics; standardization.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32504536
1607,Identifying vulnerable older adult populations by contextualizing geriatric syndrome information in clinical notes of electronic health records,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Geriatric syndromes such as functional disability and lack of social support are often not encoded in electronic health records (EHRs), thus obscuring the identification of vulnerable older adults in need of additional medical and social services. In this study, we automatically identify vulnerable older adult patients with geriatric syndrome based on clinical notes extracted from an EHR system, and demonstrate how contextual information can improve the process. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      We propose a novel end-to-end neural architecture to identify sentences that contain geriatric syndromes. Our model learns a representation of the sentence and augments it with contextual information: surrounding sentences, the entire clinical document, and the diagnosis codes associated with the document. We trained our system on annotated notes from 85 patients, tuned the model on another 50 patients, and evaluated its performance on the rest, 50 patients. Results:
      
    

    
      Contextual information improved classification, with the most effective context coming from the surrounding sentences. At sentence level, our best performing model achieved a micro-F1 of 0.605, significantly outperforming context-free baselines. At patient level, our best model achieved a micro-F1 of 0.843. Discussion:
      
    

    
      Our solution can be used to expand the identification of vulnerable older adults with geriatric syndromes. Since functional and social factors are often not captured by diagnosis codes in EHRs, the automatic identification of the geriatric syndrome can reduce disparities by ensuring consistent care across the older adult population.

This structure is suitable for analyzing the key elements of technology, as well as the relationships between these elements. However, analysis using the existing SAO structure requires a substantial number of manual processes because this structure does not represent the context of the sentences. Thus, we introduce the concept of SAO2Vec, in which SAO is used to embed the vectors of sentences and documents, for use in text mining in the analysis of technical documents. First, the technical documents of interest are collected, and SAO structures are extracted from them. Then, sentence vectors are extracted through the Doc2Vec algorithm and are updated using word vectors in the SAO structure. Finally, SAO vectors are drawn using an updated sentence vector with the same SAO structure. In addition, document vectors are derived from the document's SAO vectors. The results of an experiment in the Internet of things field indicate that the SAO2Vec method produces 3.1% better accuracy than the Doc2Vec method and 115.0% better accuracy than SAO frequency alone. This proves that the proposed SAO2Vec algorithm can be used to improve grouping and similarity analysis by including both the meanings and the contexts of technical elements.","['1 Department of Industrial & Systems Engineering, College of Engineering, Dongguk University, Seoul, SOUTH KOREA.', '2 College of IT Engineering, Hansung University, Seoul, SOUTH KOREA.']","Sunhye Kim, Inchae Park, Byungun Yoon, ",PloS one,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32023289
1609,Characterizing DSM-5 and ICD-11 personality disorder features in psychiatric inpatients at scale using electronic health records,"Background:
      
    

    
      Investigation of personality traits and pathology in large, generalizable clinical cohorts has been hindered by inconsistent assessment and failure to consider a range of personality disorders (PDs) simultaneously. Methods:
      
    

    
      We applied natural language processing (NLP) of electronic health record notes to characterize a psychiatric inpatient cohort. A set of terms reflecting personality trait domains were derived, expanded, and then refined based on expert consensus. Latent Dirichlet allocation was used to score notes to estimate the extent to which any given note reflected PD topics. Regression models were used to examine the relationship of these estimates with sociodemographic features and length of stay. Results:
      
    

    
      Among 3623 patients with 4702 admissions, being male, non-white, having a low burden of medical comorbidity, being admitted through the emergency department, and having public insurance were independently associated with greater levels of disinhibition, detachment, and psychoticism. Being female, white, and having private insurance were independently associated with greater levels of negative affectivity. The presence of disinhibition, psychoticism, and negative affectivity were each significantly associated with a longer stay, while detachment was associated with a shorter stay. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Personality features can be systematically and scalably measured using NLP in the inpatient setting, and some of these features associate with length of stay. Developing treatment strategies for patients scoring high in certain personality dimensions may facilitate more efficient, targeted interventions, and may help reduce the impact of personality features on mental health service utilization.","['1 Center for Quantitative Health, Division of Clinical Research and Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.', '2 Department of Psychiatry, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.', '3 University Psychiatric Clinic, University of Chile Clinical Hospital, Santiago, Chile.']","Sergio A Barroilhet, Amelia M Pellegrini, Thomas H McCoy, Roy H Perlis, ",Psychological medicine,2019,Electronic health record; length of stay; machine learning; natural language processing; personality disorder.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31544723
1610,Enhancing clinical concept extraction with contextual embeddings,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Neural network-based representations (""embeddings"") have dramatically advanced natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including clinical NLP tasks such as concept extraction. Recently, however, more advanced embedding methods and representations (eg, ELMo, BERT) have further pushed the state of the art in NLP, yet there are no common best practices for how to integrate these representations into clinical tasks. The purpose of this study, then, is to explore the space of possible options in utilizing these new models for clinical concept extraction, including comparing these to traditional word embedding methods (word2vec, GloVe, fastText). Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      Both off-the-shelf, open-domain embeddings and pretrained clinical embeddings from MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III) are evaluated. We explore a battery of embedding methods consisting of traditional word embeddings and contextual embeddings and compare these on 4 concept extraction corpora: i2b2 2010, i2b2 2012, SemEval 2014, and SemEval 2015. We also analyze the impact of the pretraining time of a large language model like ELMo or BERT on the extraction performance. Last, we present an intuitive way to understand the semantic information encoded by contextual embeddings. Results:
      
    

    
      Contextual embeddings pretrained on a large clinical corpus achieves new state-of-the-art performances across all concept extraction tasks. The best-performing model outperforms all state-of-the-art methods with respective F1-measures of 90.25, 93.18 (partial), 80.74, and 81.65. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We demonstrate the potential of contextual embeddings through the state-of-the-art performance these methods achieve on clinical concept extraction. Additionally, we demonstrate that contextual embeddings encode valuable semantic information not accounted for in traditional word representations.","['1 School of Biomedical Informatics, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, Texas, USA.']","Yuqi Si, Jingqi Wang, Hua Xu, Kirk Roberts, ",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2019,clinical concept extraction; contextual embeddings; language model.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31265066
1611,A graph-based method for reconstructing entities from coordination ellipsis in medical text,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Coordination ellipsis is a linguistic phenomenon abound in medical text and is challenging for concept normalization because of difficulty in recognizing elliptical expressions referencing 2 or more entities accurately. To resolve this bottleneck, we aim to contribute a generalizable method to reconstruct concepts from medical coordinated elliptical expressions in a variety of biomedical corpora. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      We proposed a graph-based representation model and built a pipeline to reconstruct concepts from coordinated elliptical expressions in medical text (RECEEM). There are 4 modules: (1) identify all possible candidate conjunct pairs from original coordinated elliptical expressions, (2) calculate coefficients for candidate conjuncts using the embedding model, (3) select the most appropriate decompositions by global optimization, and (4) rebuild concepts based on a pathfinding algorithm. We evaluated the pipeline's performance on 2658 coordinated elliptical expressions from 3 different medical corpora (ie, biomedical literature, clinical narratives, and eligibility criteria from clinical trials). Precision, recall, and F1 score were calculated. Results:
      
    

    
      The F1 scores for biomedical publications, clinical narratives, and research eligibility criteria were 0.862, 0.721, and 0.870, respectively. RECEEM outperformed 2 previously released methods. By incorporating RECEEM into 2 existing NLP tools, the F1 scores increased from 0.248 to 0.460 and from 0.287 to 0.630 on concept mapping of 1125 coordination ellipses. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      RECEEM improves concept normalization for medical coordinated elliptical expressions in a variety of biomedical corpora. It outperformed existing methods and significantly enhanced the performance of 2 notable NLP systems for mapping coordination ellipses in the evaluation.

These literature are mostly available and readily accessible in electronic format. The domain knowledge hidden in them is critical for biomedical research and applications, which makes biomedical literature mining (BLM) techniques highly demanding. Numerous efforts have been made on this topic from both biomedical informatics (BMI) and computer science (CS) communities. The BMI community focuses more on the concrete application problems and thus prefer more interpretable and descriptive methods, while the CS community chases more on superior performance and generalization ability, thus more sophisticated and universal models are developed.

Progress had historically languished in these areas, such that these skills had come to seem ineffably bound to intelligence. However, these commercial advances have performed best at single-task applications in which imperfect outputs and occasional frank errors can be tolerated.The practice of anesthesiology is different. It embodies a requirement for high reliability, and a pressured cycle of interpretation, physical action, and response rather than any single cognitive act. This review covers the basics of what is meant by artificial intelligence and machine learning for the practicing anesthesiologist, describing how decision-making behaviors can emerge from simple equations. Relevant clinical questions are introduced to illustrate how machine learning might help solve them-perhaps bringing anesthesiology into an era of machine-assisted discovery.","[""1 From the Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative and Pain Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital; and the Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts.""]","Christopher W Connor, ",Anesthesiology,2019 Dec,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30973516
1614,Cortical network responses map onto data-driven features that capture visual semantics of movie fragments,"Research on how the human brain extracts meaning from sensory input relies in principle on methodological reductionism. In the present study, we adopt a more holistic approach by modeling the cortical responses to semantic information that was extracted from the visual stream of a feature film, employing artificial neural network models. Advances in both computer vision and natural language processing were utilized to extract the semantic representations from the film by combining perceptual and linguistic information. We tested whether these representations were useful in studying the human brain data. To this end, we collected electrocorticography responses to a short movie from 37 subjects and fitted their cortical patterns across multiple regions using the semantic components extracted from film frames. We found that individual semantic components reflected fundamental semantic distinctions in the visual input, such as presence or absence of people, human movement, landscape scenes, human faces, etc. Moreover, each semantic component mapped onto a distinct functional cortical network involving high-level cognitive regions in occipitotemporal, frontal and parietal cortices. The present work demonstrates the potential of the data-driven methods from information processing fields to explain patterns of cortical responses, and contributes to the overall discussion about the encoding of high-level perceptual information in the human brain.","['1 Brain Center, Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, University Medical Center Utrecht, Heidelberglaan 100, 3584 CX, Utrecht, The Netherlands. y.berezutskaya@umcutrecht.nl.', '2 Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University, Montessorilaan 3, 6525 HR, Nijmegen, The Netherlands. y.berezutskaya@umcutrecht.nl.', '3 Brain Center, Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, University Medical Center Utrecht, Heidelberglaan 100, 3584 CX, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', '4 Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University, Montessorilaan 3, 6525 HR, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']","Julia Berezutskaya, Zachary V Freudenburg, Luca Ambrogioni, Umut Güçlü, Marcel A J van Gerven, Nick F Ramsey, ",Scientific reports,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32694561
1615,ProbeRating: A recommender system to infer binding profiles for nucleic acid-binding proteins,"Motivation:
      
    

    
      The interaction between proteins and nucleic acids plays a crucial role in gene regulation and cell function. Determining the binding preferences of nucleic acid-binding proteins (NBPs), namely RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and transcription factors (TFs), is the key to decipher the protein-nucleic acids interaction code. Today, available NBP binding data from in vivo or in vitro experiments are still limited, which leaves a large portion of NBPs uncovered. Unfortunately, existing computational methods that model the NBP binding preferences are mostly protein-specific: they need the experimental data for a specific protein in interest, and thus only focus on experimentally characterized NBPs. The binding preferences of experimentally unexplored NBPs remain largely unknown. Results:
      
    

    
      Here, we introduce ProbeRating, a nucleic acid recommender system that utilizes techniques from deep learning and word embeddings of natural language processing. ProbeRating is developed to predict binding profiles for unexplored or poorly studied NBPs by exploiting their homologs NBPs which currently have available binding data. Requiring only sequence information as input, ProbeRating adapts FastText from Facebook AI Research to extract biological features. It then builds a neural network based recommender system. We evaluate the performance of ProbeRating on two different tasks: one for RBP and one for TF. As a result, ProbeRating outperforms previous methods on both tasks. The results show that ProbeRating can be a useful tool to study the binding mechanism for the many NBPs that lack direct experimental evidence. Availability:

1616,Priorities to Overcome Barriers Impacting Data Science Application in Emergency Care Research,"For a variety of reasons including cheap computing, widespread adoption of electronic medical records, digitalization of imaging and biosignals, and rapid development of novel technologies, the amount of health care data being collected, recorded, and stored is increasing at an exponential rate. Yet despite these advances, methods for the valid, efficient, and ethical utilization of these data remain underdeveloped. Emergency care research, in particular, poses several unique challenges in this rapidly evolving field. A group of content experts was recently convened to identify research priorities related to barriers to the application of data science to emergency care research. These recommendations included: 1) developing methods for cross-platform identification and linkage of patients; 2) creating central, deidentified, open-access databases; 3) improving methodologies for visualization and analysis of intensively sampled data; 4) developing methods to identify and standardize electronic medical record data quality; 5) improving and utilizing natural language processing; 6) developing and utilizing syndrome or complaint-based based taxonomies of disease; 7) developing practical and ethical framework to leverage electronic systems for controlled trials; 8) exploring technologies to help enable clinical trials in the emergency setting; and 9) training emergency care clinicians in data science and data scientists in emergency care medicine.

1617,Diagnostic Algorithms to Study Post-Concussion Syndrome Using Electronic Health Records: Validating a Method to Capture an Important Patient Population,"Post-concussion syndrome (PCS) is characterized by persistent cognitive, somatic, and emotional symptoms after a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Genetic and other biological variables may contribute to PCS etiology, and the emergence of biobanks linked to electronic health records (EHRs) offers new opportunities for research on PCS. We sought to validate the EHR data of PCS patients by comparing two diagnostic algorithms deployed in the Vanderbilt University Medical Center de-identified database of 2.8 million patient EHRs. The algorithms identified individuals with PCS by: 1) natural language processing (NLP) of narrative text in the EHR combined with structured demographic, diagnostic, and encounter data; or 2) coded billing and procedure data. The predictive value of each algorithm was assessed, and cases and controls identified by each approach were compared on demographic and medical characteristics. The NLP algorithm identified 507 cases and 10,857 controls. The negative predictive value in controls was 78% and the positive predictive value (PPV) in cases was 82%. Conversely, the coded algorithm identified 1142 patients with two or more PCS billing codes and had a PPV of 76%. Comparisons of PCS controls to both case groups recovered known epidemiology of PCS: cases were more likely than controls to be female and to have pre-morbid diagnoses of anxiety, migraine, and post-traumatic stress disorder. In contrast, controls and cases were equally likely to have attention deficit hyperactive disorder and learning disabilities, in accordance with the findings of recent systematic reviews of PCS risk factors. We conclude that EHRs are a valuable research tool for PCS. Ascertainment based on coded data alone had a predictive value comparable to an NLP algorithm, recovered known PCS risk factors, and maximized the number of included patients.","['1 1 Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.', '2 2 Vanderbilt Genetics Institute, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.', '3 3 Vanderbilt Sports Concussion Center, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee.', '4 4 Department of Neurological Surgery, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee.']","Jessica Dennis, Aaron M Yengo-Kahn, Paul Kirby, Gary S Solomon, Nancy J Cox, Scott L Zuckerman, ",Journal of neurotrauma,2019,diagnostic algorithm; electronic health records; post-concussion syndrome.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30773988

       Incidental radiographic findings, such as adrenal nodules, are commonly identified in imaging studies and documented in radiology reports. However, patients with such findings frequently do not receive appropriate follow-up, partially due to the lack of tools for the management of such findings and the time required to maintain up-to-date lists. Natural language processing (NLP) is capable of extracting information from free-text clinical documents and could provide the basis for software solutions that do not require changes to clinical workflows. Objectives:
      
    

    
       In this manuscript we present (1) a machine learning algorithm we trained to identify radiology reports documenting the presence of a newly discovered adrenal incidentaloma, and (2) the web application and results database we developed to manage these clinical findings. Methods:
      
    

    
       We manually annotated a training corpus of 4,090 radiology reports from across our institution with a binary label indicating whether or not a report contains a newly discovered adrenal incidentaloma. We trained a convolutional neural network to perform this text classification task. Over the NLP backbone we built a web application that allows users to coordinate clinical management of adrenal incidentalomas in real time. Results:
      
    

    
       The annotated dataset included 404 positive (9.9%) and 3,686 (90.1%) negative reports. Our model achieved a sensitivity of 92.9% (95% confidence interval: 80.9-97.5%), a positive predictive value of 83.0% (69.9-91.1)%, a specificity of 97.8% (95.8-98.9)%, and an F1 score of 87.6%. We developed a front-end web application based on the model's output. Conclusion:
      
    

    
       Developing an NLP-enabled custom web application for tracking and management of high-risk adrenal incidentalomas is feasible in a resource constrained, safety net hospital. Such applications can be used by an institution's quality department or its primary care providers and can easily be generalized to other types of clinical findings.","['1 Boston Medical Center, One Boston Medical Center Pl, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.', '2 Department of Family Medicine, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', '3 Department of Internal Medicine, Kent Hospital, Brown University Alpert Medical School, Warwick, Rhode Island, United States.']","Wasif Bala, Jackson Steinkamp, Timothy Feeney, Avneesh Gupta, Abhinav Sharma, Jake Kantrowitz, Nicholas Cordella, James Moses, Frederick Thurston Drake, ",Applied clinical informatics,2020 Aug,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32937677
1620,The exploration of Parkinson's disease: a multi-modal data analysis of resting functional magnetic resonance imaging and gene data,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most universal chronic degenerative neurological dyskinesia and an important threat to elderly health. At present, the researches of PD are mainly based on single-modal data analysis, while the fusion research of multi-modal data may provide more meaningful information in the aspect of comprehending the pathogenesis of PD. In this paper, 104 samples having resting functional magnetic resonance imaging (rfMRI) and gene data are from Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database to predict pathological brain areas and risk genes related to PD. In the experiment, Pearson correlation analysis is adopted to conduct fusion analysis from the data of genes and brain areas as multi-modal sample characteristics, and the clustering evolution random forest (CERF) method is applied to detect the discriminative genes and brain areas. The experimental results indicate that compared with several existing advanced methods, the CERF method can further improve the diagnosis of PD and healthy control, and can achieve a significant effect. More importantly, we find that there are some interesting associations between brain areas and genes in PD patients. Based on these associations, we notice that PD-related brain areas include angular gyrus, thalamus, posterior cingulate gyrus and paracentral lobule, and risk genes mainly include C6orf10, HLA-DPB1 and HLA-DOA.

1621,Can online support groups address psychological morbidity of cancer patients? An artificial intelligence based investigation of prostate cancer trajectories,"Background:
      
    

    
      Online Cancer Support Groups (OCSG) are becoming an increasingly vital source of information, experiences and empowerment for patients with cancer. Despite significant contributions to physical, psychological and emotional wellbeing of patients, OCSG are yet to be formally recognised and used in multidisciplinary cancer support programs. This study highlights the opportunity of using Artificial Intelligence (AI) in OCSG to address psychological morbidity, with supporting empirical evidence from prostate cancer (PCa) patients. Methods:
      
    

    
      A validated framework of AI techniques and Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, was used to investigate PCa patient activities based on conversations in ten international OCSG (18,496 patients- 277,805 conversations). The specific focus was on activities that indicate psychological morbidity; the reasons for joining OCSG, deep emotions and the variation from joining through to milestones in the cancer trajectory. Comparative analyses were conducted using t-tests, One-way ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer post-hoc analysis. Findings:
      
    

    
      PCa patients joined OCSG at four key phases of psychological distress; diagnosis, treatment, side-effects, and recurrence, the majority group was 'treatment' (61.72%). The four groups varied in expression of the intense emotional burden of cancer. The 'side-effects' group expressed increased negative emotions during the first month compared to other groups (p<0.01). A comparison of pre-treatment vs post-treatment emotions showed that joining pre-treatment had significantly lower negative emotions after 12-months compared to post-treatment (p<0.05). Long-term deep emotion analysis reveals that all groups except 'recurrence' improved in emotional wellbeing. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      This is the first empirical study of psychological morbidity and deep emotions expressed by men with a new diagnosis of cancer, using AI. PCa patients joining pre-treatment had improved emotions, and long-term participation in OCSG led to an increase in emotional wellbeing, indicating a decrease in psychological distress. It is opportune to further investigate AI in OCSG for early psychological intervention as an adjunct to conventional intervention programs.","['1 Research Centre for Data Analytics and Cognition, La Trobe University, Bundoora, Victoria, Australia.', '2 MD Anderson Cancer Center, University of Texas, Houston, Texas.', '3 College of Engineering and Science, Victoria University, Heidelberg, Victoria, Australia.', '4 NHS Trust, North Bristol, England, United Kingdom.', '5 Department of Surgery, University of Melbourne and Olivia Newton-John Cancer Centre, Austin Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.', '6 EJ Whitten Prostate Cancer Research Centre at Epworth Healthcare, Melbourne, Australia.', '7 Division of Cancer Surgery, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia.']","Achini Adikari, Daswin de Silva, Weranja K B Ranasinghe, Tharindu Bandaragoda, Oshadi Alahakoon, Raj Persad, Nathan Lawrentschuk, Damminda Alahakoon, Damien Bolton, ",PloS one,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32130256
1622,"Patient-Reported Outcomes in Online Communications on Statins, Memory, and Cognition: Qualitative Analysis Using Online Communities","Background:
      
    

    
      In drug development clinical trials, there is a need for balance between restricting variables by setting eligibility criteria and representing the broader patient population that may use a product once it is approved. Similarly, although recent policy initiatives focusing on the inclusion of historically underrepresented groups are being implemented, barriers still remain. These limitations of clinical trials may mask potential product benefits and side effects. To bridge these gaps, online communication in health communities may serve as an additional population signal for drug side effects. Objective:
      
    

    
      The aim of this study was to employ a nontraditional dataset to identify drug side-effect signals. The study was designed to apply both natural language processing (NLP) technology and hands-on linguistic analysis to a set of online posts from known statin users to (1) identify any underlying crossover between the use of statins and impairment of memory or cognition and (2) obtain patient lexicon in their descriptions of experiences with statin medications and memory changes. Methods:
      
    

    
      Researchers utilized user-generated content on Inspire, looking at over 11 million posts across Inspire. Posts were written by patients and caregivers belonging to a variety of communities on Inspire. After identifying these posts, researchers used NLP and hands-on linguistic analysis to draw and expand upon correlations among statin use, memory, and cognition. Results:
      
    

    
      NLP analysis of posts identified statistical correlations between statin users and the discussion of memory impairment, which were not observed in control groups. NLP found that, out of all members on Inspire, 3.1% had posted about memory or cognition. In a control group of those who had posted about TNF inhibitors, 6.2% had also posted about memory and cognition. In comparison, of all those who had posted about a statin medication, 22.6% (P<.001) also posted about memory and cognition. Furthermore, linguistic analysis of a sample of posts provided themes and context to these statistical findings. By looking at posts from statin users about memory, four key themes were found and described in detail in the data: memory loss, aphasia, cognitive impairment, and emotional change. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Correlations from this study point to a need for further research on the impact of statins on memory and cognition. Furthermore, when using nontraditional datasets, such as online communities, NLP and linguistic methodologies broaden the population for identifying side-effect signals. For side effects such as those on memory and cognition, where self-reporting may be unreliable, these methods can provide another avenue to inform patients, providers, and the Food and Drug Administration.","['1 Department of Cardiovascular Disease, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States.', '2 Inspire, Arlington, VA, United States.']","Farris Timimi, Sara Ray, Erik Jones, Lee Aase, Kathleen Hoffman, ",Journal of medical Internet research,2019,PROMs; drug-related side effects and adverse reactions; hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors; infodemiology; infoveillance; memory loss; peer-support groups; pharmacovigilance; social media.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31778117
1623,Machine Learning Assisted Citation Screening for Systematic Reviews,"Evidence-based practice is highly dependent upon up-to-date systematic reviews (SR) for decision making. However, conducting and updating systematic reviews, especially the citation screening for identification of relevant studies, requires much human work and is therefore expensive. Automating citation screening using machine learning (ML) based approaches can reduce cost and labor. Machine learning has been applied to automate citation screening but not for the SRs with very narrow research questions. This paper reports the results and observations for an ongoing research that aims to automate citation screening for SRs with narrow research questions using machine learning. The research also sheds light on the problem of class imbalance and class overlap on the performance of ML classifiers when applied to SRs with narrow research questions.","['1 University of Applied Sciences Western Switzerland (HES-SO), Sierre, Switzerland.', '2 School of Health Sciences, HES-SO Valais-Wallis, Leukerbad, Switzerland.', '3 University of Geneva (UNIGE), Geneva, Switzerland.']","Anjani Dhrangadhariya, Roger Hilfiker, Roger Schaer, Henning Müller, ",Studies in health technology and informatics,2020,Automation; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Systematic reviews.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32570395
1624,RIscoper: a tool for RNA-RNA interaction extraction from the literature,"Motivation:
      
    

    
      Numerous experimental and computational studies in the biomedical literature have provided considerable amounts of data on diverse RNA-RNA interactions (RRIs). However, few text mining systems for RRIs information extraction are available. Results:
      
    

    
      RNA Interactome Scoper (RIscoper) represents the first tool for full-scale RNA interactome scanning and was developed for extracting RRIs from the literature based on the N-gram model. Notably, a reliable RRI corpus was integrated in RIscoper, and more than 13 300 manually curated sentences with RRI information were recruited. RIscoper allows users to upload full texts or abstracts, and provides an online search tool that is connected with PubMed (PMID and keyword input), and these capabilities are useful for biologists. RIscoper has a strong performance (90.4% precision and 93.9% recall), integrates natural language processing techniques and has a reliable RRI corpus.

1625,The orbitofrontal cortex spontaneously encodes food health and contains more distinct representations for foods highest in tastiness,"The human orbitofrontal cortex has long been associated with food reward processing and is thought to represent modality independent signals of value. Food tastiness and health are core attributes of many models of food choice and dietary self-control. Here we used functional neuroimaging to examine the neural representation of tastiness and health for a set of 28 food categories selected to be orthogonal with respect to both dimensions. Using representational similarity analysis, in conjunction with linear mixed-effects modeling, we demonstrate that the orbitofrontal cortex spontaneously encodes food health, whereas tastiness was associated with greater neural dissimilarity. Subsequent analyses using model dissimilarity matrices that encode overall tastiness magnitude demonstrated that the neural representation of foods grows more distinct with increasing tastiness but not with increasing health. In a separate study, we use lexical analysis of natural language descriptions of food to show that food tastiness is associated with more elaborated descriptions of food. Together these data show not only that the orbitofrontal cortex spontaneously encodes the dimensions of health and tastiness when viewing appetitive food cues but that the neural and cognitive representations of food categories that are the highest in tastiness are more refined than those lower in tastiness.","['1 Department of Psychology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.']","Allison M Londerée, Dylan D Wagner, ",Social cognitive and affective neuroscience,2020,food; multivariate pattern analysis; orbitofrontal cortex; representational similarity analysis; reward.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32613228
1626,A customizable deep learning model for nosocomial risk prediction from critical care notes with indirect supervision,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Reliable longitudinal risk prediction for hospitalized patients is needed to provide quality care. Our goal is to develop a generalizable model capable of leveraging clinical notes to predict healthcare-associated diseases 24-96 hours in advance. Methods:
      
    

    
      We developed a reCurrent Additive Network for Temporal RIsk Prediction (CANTRIP) to predict the risk of hospital acquired (occurring ≥ 48 hours after admission) acute kidney injury, pressure injury, or anemia ≥ 24 hours before it is implicated by the patient's chart, labs, or notes. We rely on the MIMIC III critical care database and extract distinct positive and negative cohorts for each disease. We retrospectively determine the date-of-event using structured and unstructured criteria and use it as a form of indirect supervision to train and evaluate CANTRIP to predict disease risk using clinical notes. Results:
      
    

    
      Our experiments indicate that CANTRIP, operating on text alone, obtains 74%-87% area under the curve and 77%-85% Specificity. Baseline shallow models showed lower performance on all metrics, while bidirectional long short-term memory obtained the highest Sensitivity at the cost of significantly lower Specificity and Precision. Discussion:
      
    

    
      Proper model architecture allows clinical text to be successfully harnessed to predict nosocomial disease, outperforming shallow models and obtaining similar performance to disease-specific models reported in the literature. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Clinical text on its own can provide a competitive alternative to traditional structured features (eg, lab values, vital signs).

1627,Artificial Intelligence for Mental Health and Mental Illnesses: an Overview,"Purpose of review:
      
    

    
      Artificial intelligence (AI) technology holds both great promise to transform mental healthcare and potential pitfalls. This article provides an overview of AI and current applications in healthcare, a review of recent original research on AI specific to mental health, and a discussion of how AI can supplement clinical practice while considering its current limitations, areas needing additional research, and ethical implications regarding AI technology. Recent findings:
      
    

    
      We reviewed 28 studies of AI and mental health that used electronic health records (EHRs), mood rating scales, brain imaging data, novel monitoring systems (e.g., smartphone, video), and social media platforms to predict, classify, or subgroup mental health illnesses including depression, schizophrenia or other psychiatric illnesses, and suicide ideation and attempts. Collectively, these studies revealed high accuracies and provided excellent examples of AI's potential in mental healthcare, but most should be considered early proof-of-concept works demonstrating the potential of using machine learning (ML) algorithms to address mental health questions, and which types of algorithms yield the best performance. As AI techniques continue to be refined and improved, it will be possible to help mental health practitioners re-define mental illnesses more objectively than currently done in the DSM-5, identify these illnesses at an earlier or prodromal stage when interventions may be more effective, and personalize treatments based on an individual's unique characteristics. However, caution is necessary in order to avoid over-interpreting preliminary results, and more work is required to bridge the gap between AI in mental health research and clinical care.","['1 Department of Psychiatry, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', '2 Sam and Rose Stein Institute for Research on Aging, University of California La Jolla, La Jolla, CA, USA.', '3 VA San Diego Healthcare System, San Diego, CA, USA.', '4 Department of Family Medicine and Public Health, University of California La Jolla, La Jolla, CA, USA.', '5 Scalable Knowledge Intelligence, IBM Research-Almaden, San Jose, CA, USA.', '6 Department of Psychiatry, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA. djeste@ucsd.edu.', '7 Sam and Rose Stein Institute for Research on Aging, University of California La Jolla, La Jolla, CA, USA. djeste@ucsd.edu.', '8 Department of Neurosciences, University of California La Jolla, La Jolla, CA, USA. djeste@ucsd.edu.', '9 University of California San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive, Mail Code #0664, La Jolla, CA, 92093-0664, USA. djeste@ucsd.edu.']","Sarah Graham, Colin Depp, Ellen E Lee, Camille Nebeker, Xin Tu, Ho-Cheol Kim, Dilip V Jeste, ",Current psychiatry reports,2019,Bioethics; Deep learning; Depression; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Research ethics; Schizophrenia; Suicide; Technology.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31701320
1628,Summarization of biomedical articles using domain-specific word embeddings and graph ranking,"Text summarization tools can help biomedical researchers and clinicians reduce the time and effort needed for acquiring important information from numerous documents. It has been shown that the input text can be modeled as a graph, and important sentences can be selected by identifying central nodes within the graph. However, the effective representation of documents, quantifying the relatedness of sentences, and selecting the most informative sentences are main challenges that need to be addressed in graph-based summarization. In this paper, we address these challenges in the context of biomedical text summarization. We evaluate the efficacy of a graph-based summarizer using different types of context-free and contextualized embeddings. The word representations are produced by pre-training neural language models on large corpora of biomedical texts. The summarizer models the input text as a graph in which the strength of relations between sentences is measured using the domain specific vector representations. We also assess the usefulness of different graph ranking techniques in the sentence selection step of our summarization method. Using the common Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) metrics, we evaluate the performance of our summarizer against various comparison methods. The results show that when the summarizer utilizes proper combinations of context-free and contextualized embeddings, along with an effective ranking method, it can outperform the other methods. We demonstrate that the best settings of our graph-based summarizer can efficiently improve the informative content of summaries and decrease the redundancy.","['1 Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Decision Support, Center for Medical Statistics, Informatics, and Intelligent Systems, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.

1629,A balancing act: racial disparities in cardiovascular disease mortality among women diagnosed with breast cancer,"Background:
      
    

    
      The cardiotoxic effects of breast cancer therapies are well documented in clinical trials. However, clinical trials often underrepresent those at highest risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD)related outcomes and have limited generalizability to the larger breast cancer population. In addition, racial differences in treatment-associated CVD mortality have yet to be explored. In this study, we sought to quantify the relationship between breast cancer therapies and CVD mortality, and explore whether this effect differed between non-Hispanic black (NHB) and white (NHW) women. Methods:
      
    

    
      Using data from the Georgia Cancer Registry, we identified women diagnosed with a first primary invasive breast cancer [2010-2014], residing in the metropolitan Atlanta area (n=3,580 NHB; n=4,923 NHW), and followed them for mortality through December 31, 2018. Exposures of interest included therapies with potential cardiotoxic effects including chemotherapy and hormone therapy, which are routinely collected by the GCR. Individual agents are not captured within the GCR, therefore trastuzumab was identified using natural language processing of textual descriptions. We used propensity score weighted Cox proportional hazards regression to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between each treatment modality and CVD mortality among the overall cohort and by race. Results:
      
    

    
      In the overall cohort, similar hazards of CVD mortality were found among women treated with chemotherapy (HR =1.10, 95% CI: 0.62, 1.96) and hormone therapy (HR =0.94, 95% CI: 0.59, 1.50), compared to women who did not receive the respective treatments. In contrast, women treated with trastuzumab had a higher hazard of CVD mortality compared to women not treated with trastuzumab (HR =2.05, 95% CI: 0.76, 5.52). In race-specific models, hormone therapy was associated with a higher hazard of CVD mortality among NHB women (HR =2.18, 95% CI: 0.78, 6.12), but not NHW women (HR =0.66, 95% CI: 0.39, 1.13). Similar, albeit attenuated, associations were found for chemotherapy. We were unable to investigate race-specific effects of trastuzumab due to low prevalence and insufficient number of events. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      In our study, we observed more pronounced associations of chemotherapy and hormone therapy with CVD mortality among NHB women, for whom we know have greater CVD-related comorbidities at breast cancer diagnosis. Patients may benefit from treatment plans that find a balance between curative breast cancer treatment and prevention of CVD-related events and mortality. CVD-related outcomes may be most relevant for women with hormone receptor positive disease due to shared risk factors (e.g., obesity, tobacco use, physical activity) and longer survival.","['1 Department of Epidemiology, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.', '2 Department of Biostatistics, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.', '3 Glenn Family Breast Center, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.', '4 Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.']","Lindsay J Collin, Alyssa N Troeschel, Yuan Liu, Keerthi Gogineni, Kylee Borger, Kevin C Ward, Lauren E McCullough, ",Annals of cancer epidemiology,2020 Mar,Breast neoplasms; cardiotoxicity; cardiovascular diseases; health disparities; mortality.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32954254
1630,Managing Functional Neurological Disorders: Protocol of a Cohort Study on Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures Study,"Background:
      
    

    
      Functional neurological disorders (FNDs) are neurological symptoms that cannot be explained by an underlying neurological lesion or other medical illness and that do not have clear neuropathological correlates. Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) are a common and highly disabling form of FND, characterized by paroxysmal episodes of involuntary movements and altered consciousness that can appear clinically similar to epileptic seizures. PNES are unique among FNDs in that they are diagnosed by video electroencephalographic (VEEG), a well-established biomarker for the disorder. The course of illness and response to treatment of PNES remain controversial. This study aims to describe the epidemiology of PNES in the Department of Veterans Affairs Healthcare System (VA), evaluate outcomes of veterans offered different treatments, and compare models of care for PNES. Methods:
      
    

    
      This electronic health record (EHR) cohort study utilizes an informatics search tool and a natural language processing algorithm to identify cases of PNES nationally. We will use VA inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy, and chart abstraction data across all 170 medical centers to identify cases in fiscal years 2002-2018. Outcome measurements such as seizure frequency, emergency room visits, hospital admissions, suicide-related behavior, and the utilization of psychotherapy prior to and after PNES diagnosis will be used to assess the effectiveness of models of care. Discussion:
      
    

    
      This study will describe the risk factors and course of treatment of a large cohort of people with PNES. Since PNES are cared for by a variety of different modalities, treatment orientations, and models of care, effectiveness outcomes such as seizure outcomes and utilization of emergency visits for seizures will be assessed. Outcome measurements such as seizure frequency, emergency room visits, hospital admissions, suicide-related behavior, and psychotherapy prior to and after PNES diagnosis will be used to assess the effectiveness of models of care.","['1 VA Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven, CT, USA.', '2 Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, Department of Neurology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', '3 Westchester Medical Center, Westchester, NY, USA.', '4 Department of Psychiatry, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', '5 Department of Emergency Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', '6 University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', '7 Salt Lake City Veterans Healthcare System, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.']","Hamada Hamid Altalib, Daniela Galluzzo, Stephanie Argraves, Joseph Goulet, Yarden Bornovski, Kei-Hoi Cheung, Ebony Jackson-Shaheed, Benjamin Tolchin, Brenda T Fenton, Mary Jo Pugh, ",Neuropsychiatric disease and treatment,2019,EHR; FND; PNES; VA; Veterans Administration; electronic health record; functional neurological disorders; psychogenic non-epileptic seizures.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31920316
1631,Athena: Automated Tuning of k-mer based Genomic Error Correction Algorithms using Language Models,"The performance of most error-correction (EC) algorithms that operate on genomics reads is dependent on the proper choice of its configuration parameters, such as the value of k in k-mer based techniques. In this work, we target the problem of finding the best values of these configuration parameters to optimize error correction and consequently improve genome assembly. We perform this in an adaptive manner, adapted to different datasets and to EC tools, due to the observation that different configuration parameters are optimal for different datasets, i.e., from different platforms and species, and vary with the EC algorithm being applied. We use language modeling techniques from the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain in our algorithmic suite, Athena, to automatically tune the performance-sensitive configuration parameters. Through the use of N-Gram and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) language modeling, we validate the intuition that the EC performance can be computed quantitatively and efficiently using the ""perplexity"" metric, repurposed from NLP. After training the language model, we show that the perplexity metric calculated from a sample of the test (or production) data has a strong negative correlation with the quality of error correction of erroneous NGS reads. Therefore, we use the perplexity metric to guide a hill climbing-based search, converging toward the best configuration parameter value. Our approach is suitable for both de novo and comparative sequencing (resequencing), eliminating the need for a reference genome to serve as the ground truth. We find that Athena can automatically find the optimal value of k with a very high accuracy for 7 real datasets and using 3 different k-mer based EC algorithms, Lighter, Blue, and Racer. The inverse relation between the perplexity metric and alignment rate exists under all our tested conditions-for real and synthetic datasets, for all kinds of sequencing errors (insertion, deletion, and substitution), and for high and low error rates. The absolute value of that correlation is at least 73%. In our experiments, the best value of k found by Athena achieves an alignment rate within 0.53% of the oracle best value of k found through brute force searching (i.e., scanning through the entire range of k values). Athena's selected value of k lies within the top-3 best k values using N-Gram models and the top-5 best k values using RNN models With best parameter selection by Athena, the assembly quality (NG50) is improved by a Geometric Mean of 4.72X across the 7 real datasets.","['1 School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, USA.', '2 Department of Electronics and Electrical Communications Engineering, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', '3 Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, USA. schaterji@schaterji.io.']","Mustafa Abdallah, Ashraf Mahgoub, Hany Ahmed, Somali Chaterji, ",Scientific reports,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31695060

The CANCROX reference database was constructed by processing the scientific literature and lists more than 1300 drugs and therapies used to treat cancer, in addition to over 10 000 combinations of these drugs, including 40 types of cancer. A user-friendly interface was developed that enables researchers to search for different types of information about therapies, drug combinations, genes and types of cancer.

1633,Natural Language Processing to Ascertain Cancer Outcomes From Medical Oncologist Notes,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      Cancer research using electronic health records and genomic data sets requires clinical outcomes data, which may be recorded only in unstructured text by treating oncologists. Natural language processing (NLP) could substantially accelerate extraction of this information. Methods:
      
    

    
      Patients with lung cancer who had tumor sequencing as part of a single-institution precision oncology study from 2013 to 2018 were identified. Medical oncologists' progress notes for these patients were reviewed. For each note, curators recorded whether the assessment/plan indicated any cancer, progression/worsening of disease, and/or response to therapy or improving disease. Next, a recurrent neural network was trained using unlabeled notes to extract the assessment/plan from each note. Finally, convolutional neural networks were trained on labeled assessments/plans to predict the probability that each curated outcome was present. Model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) among a held-out test set of 10% of patients. Associations between curated response or progression end points and overall survival were measured using Cox models among patients receiving palliative-intent systemic therapy. Results:
      
    

    
      Medical oncologist notes (n = 7,597) were manually curated for 919 patients. In the 10% test set, NLP models replicated human curation with AUROCs of 0.94 for the any-cancer outcome, 0.86 for the progression outcome, and 0.90 for the response outcome. Progression/worsening events identified using NLP models were associated with shortened survival (hazard ratio [HR] for mortality, 2.49; 95% CI, 2.00 to 3.09); response/improvement events were associated with improved survival (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.67). Conclusion:
      
    

    
      NLP models based on neural networks can extract meaningful outcomes from oncologist notes at scale. Such models may facilitate identification of clinical and genomic features associated with response to cancer treatment.","['1 Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', '2 Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', '3 Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA.', '4 The Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA.']","Kenneth L Kehl, Wenxin Xu, Eva Lepisto, Haitham Elmarakeby, Michael J Hassett, Eliezer M Van Allen, Bruce E Johnson, Deborah Schrag, ",JCO clinical cancer informatics,2020 Aug,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32755459

To determine from a repertoire whether its host had been exposed to a target, computational tools that predict TCR-epitope binding are required. Currents tools are based on conserved motifs and are applied to peptides with many known binding TCRs. We employ new Natural Language Processing (NLP) based methods to predict whether any TCR and peptide bind. We combined large-scale TCR-peptide dictionaries with deep learning methods to produce ERGO (pEptide tcR matchinG predictiOn), a highly specific and generic TCR-peptide binding predictor. A set of standard tests are defined for the performance of peptide-TCR binding, including the detection of TCRs binding to a given peptide/antigen, choosing among a set of candidate peptides for a given TCR and determining whether any pair of TCR-peptide bind. ERGO reaches similar results to state of the art methods in these tests even when not trained specifically for each test.

This retrospective study included 1410 BT-RADS structured reports dated from January 2014 to December 2017 and a test set of 109 unstructured brain MR reports dated from January 2010 to December 2014. Text vector representations and semantic word embeddings were generated from individual report sections (i.e., ""History,"" ""Findings,"" etc.) using Tf-idf statistics and a fine-tuned word2vec model, respectively. Section-wise ensemble models were trained using gradient boosting (XGBoost), elastic net regularization, and random forests, and classification accuracy was evaluated on an independent test set of unstructured brain MR reports and a validation set of BT-RADS structured reports. Section-wise ensemble models using XGBoost and word2vec semantic word embeddings were more accurate than those using Tf-idf statistics when classifying unstructured reports, with an f1 score of 0.72. In contrast, models using traditional Tf-idf statistics outperformed the word2vec semantic approach for categorization from structured reports, with an f1 score of 0.98. Proposed natural language processing pipeline is capable of inferring BT-RADS report scores from unstructured reports after training on structured report data.

To address these requirements, we need deep neuromorphic architectures with recurrent connections such as deep recurrent neural networks. However, the training of such networks demand very high precision of weights, excellent conductance linearity and low write-noise- not satisfied by current memristive implementations. Inspired from optogenetics, here we report a neuromorphic computing platform comprised of photo-excitable neuristors capable of in-memory computations across 980 addressable states with a high signal-to-noise ratio of 77. The large linear dynamic range, low write noise and selective excitability allows high fidelity opto-electronic transfer of weights with a two-shot write scheme, while electrical in-memory inference provides energy efficiency. This method enables implementing a memristive deep recurrent neural network with twelve trainable layers with more than a million parameters to recognize spoken commands with >90% accuracy.","['1 School of Materials Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, 50 Nanyang Avenue, Singapore, 639798, Singapore.', '2 School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, 50 Nanyang Avenue, Singapore, 639798, Singapore.', '3 HealthTech NTU, Interdisciplinary Graduate Programme, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, 637335, Singapore.', '4 Energy Research Institute @ NTU (ERI@N), Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, 637553, Singapore.', '5 School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, 50 Nanyang Avenue, Singapore, 639798, Singapore. arindam.basu@ntu.edu.sg.', '6 School of Materials Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, 50 Nanyang Avenue, Singapore, 639798, Singapore.

1638,Overcoming Alzheimer's Disease Stigma by Leveraging Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain Technologies,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) imposes a considerable burden on those diagnosed. Faced with a neurodegenerative decline for which there is no effective cure or prevention method, sufferers of the disease are subject to judgement, both self-imposed and otherwise, that can have a great deal of effect on their lives. The burden of this stigma is more than just psychological, as reluctance to face an AD diagnosis can lead people to avoid early diagnosis, treatment, and research opportunities that may be beneficial to them, and that may help progress towards fighting AD and its progression. In this review, we discuss how recent advents in information technology may be employed to help fight this stigma. Using artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, specifically natural language processing (NLP), to classify the sentiment and tone of texts, such as those of online posts on various social media sites, has proven to be an effective tool for assessing the opinions of the general public on certain topics. These tools can be used to analyze the public stigma surrounding AD. Additionally, there is much concern among individuals that an AD diagnosis, or evidence of pre-clinical AD such as a biomarker or imaging test results, may wind up unintentionally disclosed to an entity that may discriminate against them. The lackluster security record of many medical institutions justifies this fear to an extent. Adopting more secure and decentralized methods of data transfer and storage, and giving patients enhanced ability to control their own data, such as a blockchain-based method, may help to alleviate some of these fears.","['1 Department of Psychiatry, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, MA 02129, USA.']","Alexander Pilozzi, Xudong Huang, ",Brain sciences,2020,Alzheimer’s disease; artificial intelligence; blockchain; natural language processing; sentiment analysis; social media; stigma.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32210011
1639,Association Between Endoscopist Personality and Rate of Adenoma Detection,"Background & aims:
      
    

    
      There is significant variation among endoscopists in their adenoma detection rates (ADRs). We explored associations between ADR and characteristics of endoscopists, including personality traits and financial incentives. Methods:
      
    

    
      We collected electronic health record data from October 2013 through September 2015 and calculated ADRs for physicians from 4 health systems. ADRs were risk-adjusted for differences in patient populations. Physicians were surveyed to assess financial motivations, knowledge and perceptions about colonoscopy quality, and personality traits. Of 140 physicians sent the survey, 117 responded. Results:
      
    

    
      The median risk-adjusted ADR for all surveyed physicians was 29.3% (interquartile range, 24.1%-35.5%). We found no significant association between ADR and financial incentives, malpractice concerns, or physicians' perceptions of ADR as a quality metric. ADR was associated with the degree of self-reported compulsiveness relative to peers: among endoscopists who described themselves as much more compulsive, the ADR was 33.1%; among those who described themselves as somewhat more compulsive, the ADR was 32.9%; among those who described themselves as about the same as others, the ADR was 26.4%; and among those who described themselves as somewhat less compulsive, the ADR was 27.3%) (P = .0019). ADR was also associated with perceived thoroughness (much more thorough than peers, ADR = 31.5%; somewhat more, 31.9%; same/somewhat less, 27.1%; P = .0173). Physicians who reported feeling rushed, having difficulty pacing themselves, or having difficulty in accomplishing goals had higher ADRs. A secondary analysis found the same associations between personality and adenomas per colonoscopy. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We found no significant association between ADR and financial incentives, malpractice concerns, or perceptions of ADR as a quality metric. However, ADRs were higher among physicians who described themselves as more compulsive or thorough, and among those who reported feeling rushed or having difficulty accomplishing goals.","['1 Division of Gastroenterology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts; Department of Health Care Policy, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.

1641,Grammar of protein domain architectures,"From an abstract, informational perspective, protein domains appear analogous to words in natural languages in which the rules of word association are dictated by linguistic rules, or grammar. Such rules exist for protein domains as well, because only a small fraction of all possible domain combinations is viable in evolution. We employ a popular linguistic technique, n-gram analysis, to probe the ""proteome grammar""-that is, the rules of association of domains that generate various domain architectures of proteins. Comparison of the complexity measures of ""protein languages"" in major branches of life shows that the relative entropy difference (information gain) between the observed domain architectures and random domain combinations is highly conserved in evolution and is close to being a universal constant, at ∼1.2 bits. Substantial deviations from this constant are observed in only two major groups of organisms: a subset of Archaea that appears to be cells simplified to the limit, and animals that display extreme complexity. We also identify the n-grams that represent signatures of the major branches of cellular life. The results of this analysis bolster the analogy between genomes and natural language and show that a ""quasi-universal grammar"" underlies the evolution of domain architectures in all divisions of cellular life. The nearly universal value of information gain by the domain architectures could reflect the minimum complexity of signal processing that is required to maintain a functioning cell.","['1 Department of Pathology, University of Alabama, Birmingham, AL 35249.', '2 National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20894.', '3 National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20894 malay@uab.edu koonin@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.', '4 Department of Pathology, University of Alabama, Birmingham, AL 35249; malay@uab.edu koonin@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.']","Lijia Yu, Deepak Kumar Tanwar, Emanuel Diego S Penha, Yuri I Wolf, Eugene V Koonin, Malay Kumar Basu, ",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019,bigram; domain architecture; language; n-gram; protein domain.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30733291
1642,Using word embeddings to expand terminology of dietary supplements on clinical notes,"Objective:
      
    

    
      The objective of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of applying word embeddings to expand the terminology of dietary supplements (DS) using over 26 million clinical notes. Methods:
      
    

    
      Word embedding models (ie, word2vec and GloVe) trained on clinical notes were used to predefine a list of top 40 semantically related terms for each of 14 commonly used DS. Each list was further evaluated by experts to generate semantically similar terms. We investigated the effect of corpus size and other settings (ie, vector size and window size) as well as the 2 word embedding models on performance for DS term expansion. We compared the number of clinical notes (and patients they represent) that were retrieved using the word embedding expanded terms to both the baseline terms and external DS sources exandped terms. Results:
      
    

    
      Using the word embedding models trained on clinical notes, we could identify 1-12 semantically similar terms for each DS. Using the word embedding exandped terms, we were able to retrieve averagely 8.39% more clinical notes and 11.68% more patients for each DS compared with 2 sets of terms. The increasing corpus size results in more misspellings, but not more semantic variants brand names. Word2vec model is also found more capable of detecting semantically similar terms than GloVe. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Our study demonstrates the utility of word embeddings on clinical notes for terminology expansion on 14 DS. We propose that this method can be potentially applied to create a DS vocabulary for downstream applications, such as information extraction.","['1 Institute for Health Informatics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', '2 College of Pharmacy, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', '3 Academic Health Center-Information Systems, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', '4 Department of Surgery, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.']","Yadan Fan, Serguei Pakhomov, Reed McEwan, Wendi Zhao, Elizabeth Lindemann, Rui Zhang, ",JAMIA open,2019 Jul,clinical notes; dietary supplements; natural language processing; terminology expansion; word embeddings.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31825016

1644,Rad-SpatialNet: A Frame-based Resource for Fine-Grained Spatial Relations in Radiology Reports,"This paper proposes a representation framework for encoding spatial language in radiology based on frame semantics. The framework is adopted from the existing SpatialNet representation in the general domain with the aim to generate more accurate representations of spatial language used by radiologists. We describe Rad-SpatialNet in detail along with illustrating the importance of incorporating domain knowledge in understanding the varied linguistic expressions involved in different radiological spatial relations. This work also constructs a corpus of 400 radiology reports of three examination types (chest X-rays, brain MRIs, and babygrams) annotated with fine-grained contextual information according to this schema. Spatial trigger expressions and elements corresponding to a spatial frame are annotated. We apply BERT-based models (BERTBASE and BERTLARGE) to first extract the trigger terms (lexical units for a spatial frame) and then to identify the related frame elements. The results of BERTLARGE are decent, with F1 of 77.89 for spatial trigger extraction and an overall F1 of 81.61 and 66.25 across all frame elements using gold and predicted spatial triggers respectively. This frame-based resource can be used to develop and evaluate more advanced natural language processing (NLP) methods for extracting fine-grained spatial information from radiology text in the future.","['1 School of Biomedical Informatics, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston.', '2 Department of Computer Science, Columbia University.', '3 McGovern Medical School, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston.']","Surabhi Datta, Morgan Ulinski, Jordan Godfrey-Stovall, Shekhar Khanpara, Roy F Riascos-Castaneda, Kirk Roberts, ",LREC ...

1645,Machine learning in medicine: a practical introduction,"Background:
      
    

    
      Following visible successes on a wide range of predictive tasks, machine learning techniques are attracting substantial interest from medical researchers and clinicians. We address the need for capacity development in this area by providing a conceptual introduction to machine learning alongside a practical guide to developing and evaluating predictive algorithms using freely-available open source software and public domain data. Methods:
      
    

    
      We demonstrate the use of machine learning techniques by developing three predictive models for cancer diagnosis using descriptions of nuclei sampled from breast masses. These algorithms include regularized General Linear Model regression (GLMs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with a radial basis function kernel, and single-layer Artificial Neural Networks. The publicly-available dataset describing the breast mass samples (N=683) was randomly split into evaluation (n=456) and validation (n=227) samples. We trained algorithms on data from the evaluation sample before they were used to predict the diagnostic outcome in the validation dataset. We compared the predictions made on the validation datasets with the real-world diagnostic decisions to calculate the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the three models. We explored the use of averaging and voting ensembles to improve predictive performance. We provide a step-by-step guide to developing algorithms using the open-source R statistical programming environment. Results:
      
    

    
      The trained algorithms were able to classify cell nuclei with high accuracy (.94 -.96), sensitivity (.97 -.99), and specificity (.85 -.94). Maximum accuracy (.96) and area under the curve (.97) was achieved using the SVM algorithm. Prediction performance increased marginally (accuracy =.97, sensitivity =.99, specificity =.95) when algorithms were arranged into a voting ensemble. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We use a straightforward example to demonstrate the theory and practice of machine learning for clinicians and medical researchers. The principals which we demonstrate here can be readily applied to other complex tasks including natural language processing and image recognition.","['1 Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, Trumpington Street, Cambridge, CB2 1PZ, UK.', '2 Department of Surgery, Harvard Medical School, 25 Shattuck Street, Boston, 01225, Massachusetts, USA. cgibbons2@bwh.harvard.edu.', ""3 Department of Surgery, Brigham and Women's Hospital, 75 Francis Street, Boston, 01225, Massachusetts, USA. cgibbons2@bwh.harvard.edu."", '4 University of Cambridge Psychometrics Centre, Trumpington Street, Cambridge, CB2 1AG, UK. cgibbons2@bwh.harvard.edu.']","Jenni A M Sidey-Gibbons, Chris J Sidey-Gibbons, ",BMC medical research methodology,2019,Classification; Computer-assisted; Decision making; Diagnosis; Medical informatics; Programming languages; Supervised machine learning.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30890124

The purpose of this study is to use online social media to understand beliefs and practices surrounding weight gain, diet and exercise during pregnancy among young women. Methods Facebook posts were mined from young women ages 16 to 24 during pregnancy who were consented from two Midwest primary care clinics serving low-income communities. Natural language processing was used to identify posts related to weight gain, exercise and diet by keyword searching. Two investigators iteratively coded the mined posts and identified major themes around health behaviors. Outcome measures included the frequency of posts and major themes regarding health behaviors during pregnancy. Results Participants (n = 43) had a mean age of 21 (SD 2.3), and the largest subgroups identified as black (49%; 26% white, 16% Hispanic, 9% other) and having graduated from high school (49%; 24% completed some high school and 24% completed at least some post-secondary education). Among the 2899 pregnancy posts analyzed, 311 were related to weight. Major themes included eating behaviors and cravings (58% of identified posts), body image (24%), the influence of family, partners and friends (14%), and the desire to exercise (4%). Conclusions for practice Facebook posts revealed that young women often frame their thoughts and feelings regarding weight gain in pregnancy in the context of food cravings and body image and that friends and family are important influencers to these behaviors.","['1 Department of Family Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', '2 University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', '3 School of Kinesiology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', '4 School of Information, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', '5 Department of Learning Health Sciences, Medical School, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', '6 Department of Family Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA. tachang@med.umich.edu.', '7 Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA. tachang@med.umich.edu.', '8 Department of Family Medicine, University of Michigan, 2800 Plymouth Road, Building 14-Room G107, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109-2800, USA. tachang@med.umich.edu.']","Elizabeth Marshall, Margaret Abigail Moon, Anicia Mirchandani, D Grace Smith, Lauren P Nichols, Xinyan Zhao, V G Vinod Vydiswaran, Tammy Chang, ",Maternal and child health journal,2019 Oct,Adolescent; Cravings; Facebook; Pregnancy; Social media; Weight gain.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31222598

      We performed a 10 years retrospective cohort study of adult kidney transplant recipients (n = 1747). We acquired data from electronic health records, United Network of Organ Sharing, social determinants of health, natural language processing data extraction, and real-time capture of dynamically evolving clinical data obtained within 1 year of transplant; from which we developed a 5 years graft survival model. Results:
      
    

    
      Total of 1439 met eligibility; 265 (18.4%) of them experienced graft loss by 5 years. Graft loss patients were characterized by: older age, being African-American, diabetic, unemployed, smokers, having marginal donor kidneys and cardiovascular comorbidities. Predictive dynamic variables included: low mean blood pressure, higher pulse pressures, higher heart rate, anaemia, lower estimated glomerular filtration rate peak, increased tacrolimus variability, rejection and readmissions. This Big Data analysis generated a 5 years graft loss model with an 82% predictive capacity, versus 66% using baseline United Network of Organ Sharing data alone. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Our analysis yielded a 5 years graft loss model demonstrating superior predictive capacity compared with United Network of Organ Sharing data alone, allowing post-transplant individualized risk-assessed care prior to transitioning back to community care.","['1 Department of Surgery, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, USA.', '2 Division of General Internal Medicine and Geriatrics, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, USA.', '3 Office of the Chief Information Officer, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, USA.', '4 Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Outcomes Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, USA.', '5 Intermountain Transplant Services, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.', '6 Department of Pharmacy, Ralph H Johnson VAMC, Charleston, South Carolina, USA.']","Derek A DuBay, Zemin Su, Thomas A Morinelli, Prabhakar Baliga, Vinayak Rohan, John Bian, David Northrup, Nicole Pilch, Vinaya Rao, Titte R Srinivas, Patrick D Mauldin, David J Taber, ","Nephrology (Carlton, Vic.)",2019 Aug,data analysis; decision support technique; graft survival; kidney; transplant.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30198104
1654,Extracting Smoking Status from Electronic Health Records Using NLP and Deep Learning,"Half a million people die every year from smoking-related issues across the United States. It is essential to identify individuals who are tobacco-dependent in order to implement preventive measures. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of deep learning models to extract smoking status of patients from clinical progress notes. A Natural Language Processing (NLP) Pipeline was built that cleans the progress notes prior to processing by three deep neural networks: a CNN, a unidirectional LSTM, and a bidirectional LSTM. Each of these models was trained with a pre- trained or a post-trained word embedding layer. Three traditional machine learning models were also employed to compare against the neural networks. Each model has generated both binary and multi-class label classification. Our results showed that the CNN model with a pre-trained embedding layer performed the best for both binary and multi- class label classification.","['1 Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston Salem, NC.', '2 Biomedical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA.']","Suraj Rajendran, Umit Topaloglu, ",AMIA Joint Summits on Translational Science proceedings.

1655,"Resilience of clinical text de-identified with ""hiding in plain sight"" to hostile reidentification attacks by human readers","Objective:
      
    

    
      Effective, scalable de-identification of personally identifying information (PII) for information-rich clinical text is critical to support secondary use, but no method is 100% effective. The hiding-in-plain-sight (HIPS) approach attempts to solve this ""residual PII problem."" HIPS replaces PII tagged by a de-identification system with realistic but fictitious (resynthesized) content, making it harder to detect remaining unredacted PII. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      Using 2000 representative clinical documents from 2 healthcare settings (4000 total), we used a novel method to generate 2 de-identified 100-document corpora (200 documents total) in which PII tagged by a typical automated machine-learned tagger was replaced by HIPS-resynthesized content. Four readers conducted aggressive reidentification attacks to isolate leaked PII: 2 readers from within the originating institution and 2 external readers. Results:
      
    

    
      Overall, mean recall of leaked PII was 26.8% and mean precision was 37.2%. Mean recall was 9% (mean precision = 37%) for patient ages, 32% (mean precision = 26%) for dates, 25% (mean precision = 37%) for doctor names, 45% (mean precision = 55%) for organization names, and 23% (mean precision = 57%) for patient names. Recall was 32% (precision = 40%) for internal and 22% (precision =33%) for external readers. Discussion and conclusions:
      
    

    
      Approximately 70% of leaked PII ""hiding"" in a corpus de-identified with HIPS resynthesis is resilient to detection by human readers in a realistic, aggressive reidentification attack scenario-more than double the rate reported in previous studies but less than the rate reported for an attack assisted by machine learning methods.","['1 Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute, Seattle, Washington, USA.', '2 Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', '3 Human Language Technology, MITRE Corporation, Bedford, Massachusetts, USA.', '4 Privacy Analytics Inc, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.']","David S Carrell, Bradley A Malin, David J Cronkite, John S Aberdeen, Cheryl Clark, Muqun Rachel Li, Dikshya Bastakoty, Steve Nyemba, Lynette Hirschman, ",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2020,biomedical research; confidentiality; de-identification; electronic health records; natural language processing; privacy.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32930712

Thus, in this paper, we first create a framework for memory organization and then compare four popular dynamic models: vanilla recurrent neural network, long short-term memory, neural stack, and neural RAM. This analysis helps to open the dynamic neural networks' black box from the memory usage prospective. Accordingly, a taxonomy for these networks and their variants is proposed and proved using a unifying architecture. With the taxonomy, both network architectures and learning tasks are classified into four classes, and a one-to-one mapping is built between them to help practitioners select the appropriate architecture. To exemplify each task type, four synthetic tasks with different memory requirements are selected.

1658,An Extensible De-Identification Framework for Privacy Protection of Unstructured Health Information: Creating Sustainable Privacy Infrastructures,"The volume of unstructured health records has increased exponentially across healthcare settings. Similarly, the number of healthcare providers that wish to exchange records has also increased and, as a result, de-identification and the preservation of privacy features have become increasingly important and necessary. Governance guidelines now require sensitive information to be masked or removed yet this remains a difficult and often ad-hoc task, particularly when dealing with unstructured text. Annotators are typically used to identify such sensitive information but they may only be effective in certain text fragments. There is at present no hybrid, sustainable framework that aggregates different annotators together. This paper proposes a novel framework that leverages a combination of state-of-the-art annotators in order to maximize the effectiveness of the de-identification of health information.","['1 Data Privacy Group, IBM Research, Dublin, Ireland.', '2 Health and Person-Centred AI Group, IBM Research, Dublin, Ireland.']","Stefano Braghin, Joao H Bettencourt-Silva, Killian Levacher, Spiros Antonatos, ",Studies in health technology and informatics,2019,De-Identification; Natural Language Processing; Privacy.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31438103

However, traditional methods of disseminating and digesting medical information can be time-consuming and cumbersome. In a pilot study, the authors used social listening to quickly extract information from social media channels to explore what people with COVID-19 are talking about regarding symptoms and disease progression. The goal was to determine whether, by amplifying patient voices, new information could be identified that might have been missed through other sources. Two data sets from social media groups of people with or presumed to have COVID-19 were analyzed: a Facebook group poll, and conversation data from a Reddit group including detailed disease natural history-like posts. Content analysis and a customized analytics engine that incorporates machine learning and natural language processing were used to quickly identify symptoms mentioned. Key findings include more than 20 symptoms in the data sets that were not listed in online lists of symptoms from 4 respected medical information sources. The disease natural history-like posts revealed that people can experience symptoms for many weeks and that some symptoms change over time. This study demonstrates that social media can offer novel insights into patient experiences as a source of real-world data. This inductive research approach can quickly generate descriptive information that can be used to develop hypotheses and new research questions. Also, the method allows rapid assessments of large numbers of social media conversations that could be applied to monitor public health for emerging and rapidly spreading diseases such as COVID-19.","['1 TREND Community, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', '2 Documented.space, Brooklyn, New York, USA.']","Maria Picone, Sarah Inoue, Christopher DeFelice, Marisa F Naujokas, Jay Sinrod, Vanessa A Cruz, Jessica Stapleton, Emily Sinrod, Sarah E Diebel, Edward Robert Wassman Jr, ",Population health management,2020,COVID-19; content analysis; data mining; disease natural histories; social listening; social media.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32897820
1660,Use of the vestibular and oculomotor examination for concussion in a pediatric emergency department,"Background:
      
    

    
      Concussion guidelines recommend a vestibular and oculomotor (VOM) examination be performed for all patients with concern for concussion, however the feasibility of performing testing is unknown. We aimed to measure rates of exam performance after implementation of training and support tools in a pediatric emergency department. Methods:
      
    

    
      We conducted a retrospective study of patients age 6 to 18 years old presenting over a 12-month period. Charts were obtained via natural language processing, where concussion was suggested as a diagnosis in the electronic health record, and then manually reviewed to record patient and provider factors. A multivariable logistic regression was performed to determine factors associated with exam performance, and a classification and regression tree (CART) analysis was performed to determine if a specific patient type was at risk for not having testing performed. Results:
      
    

    
      Four hundred patients were included in the analysis. Sixty-four percent received a VOM examination (including 73% of those diagnosed with concussion). Provider type, concussion history, symptom burden, injury mechanism, and final diagnosis were all significantly associated with exam performance. CART analysis determined patients with a non-concussion diagnosis, a non-sports injury mechanism, no prior history of concussion, and two or fewer symptoms had the lowest likelihood (46%) of receiving the exam. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Performing a VOM examination for concussion is feasible in the acute setting following provider education and using clinical support tools. The exam is more likely to be performed on those children with history or exam findings associated with perceived risk for ongoing symptoms.","[""1 Division of Emergency Medicine, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, United States of America; Center for Injury Research and Prevention, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, United States of America; Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States of America.

1661,Feature Learning of Virus Genome Evolution With the Nucleotide Skip-Gram Neural Network,"Recent studies reveal that even the smallest genomes such as viruses evolve through complex and stochastic processes, and the assumption of independent alleles is not valid in most applications. Advances in sequencing technologies produce multiple time-point whole-genome data, which enable potential interactions between these alleles to be investigated empirically. To investigate these interactions, we represent alleles as distributed vectors that encode for relationships with other alleles in the course of evolution and apply artificial neural networks to time-sampled whole-genome datasets for feature learning. We build this platform using methods and algorithms derived from natural language processing (NLP), and we denote it as the nucleotide skip-gram neural network. We learn distributed vectors of alleles using the changes in allele frequency of echovirus 11 in the presence or absence of the disinfectant (ClO2) from the experimental evolution data. Results from the training using a new open-source software TensorFlow show that the learned distributed vectors can be clustered using principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering to reveal a list of non-synonymous mutations that arise on the structural protein VP1 in connection to the candidate mutation for ClO2 adaptation. Furthermore, this method can account for recombination rates by setting the extent of interactions as a biological hyper-parameter, and the results show that the most realistic scenario of mid-range interactions across the genome is most consistent with the previous studies.","['1 Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', '2 School of Life Sciences, Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland.', '3 Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB), Lausanne, Switzerland.']","Hyunjin Shim, ",Evolutionary bioinformatics online,2019,allele embeddings; experimental evolution; feature learning; genetic interaction; neural network; virus evolution.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30692845
1662,Reverse engineering recurrent networks for sentiment classification reveals line attractor dynamics,"Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a widely used tool for modeling sequential data, yet they are often treated as inscrutable black boxes. Given a trained recurrent network, we would like to reverse engineer it-to obtain a quantitative, interpretable description of how it solves a particular task. Even for simple tasks, a detailed understanding of how recurrent networks work, or a prescription for how to develop such an understanding, remains elusive. In this work, we use tools from dynamical systems analysis to reverse engineer recurrent networks trained to perform sentiment classification, a foundational natural language processing task. Given a trained network, we find fixed points of the recurrent dynamics and linearize the nonlinear system around these fixed points. Despite their theoretical capacity to implement complex, high-dimensional computations, we find that trained networks converge to highly interpretable, low-dimensional representations. In particular, the topological structure of the fixed points and corresponding linearized dynamics reveal an approximate line attractor within the RNN, which we can use to quantitatively understand how the RNN solves the sentiment analysis task. Finally, we find this mechanism present across RNN architectures (including LSTMs, GRUs, and vanilla RNNs) trained on multiple datasets, suggesting that our findings are not unique to a particular architecture or dataset. Overall, these results demonstrate that surprisingly universal and human interpretable computations can arise across a range of recurrent networks.","['1 Google Brain, Google Inc., Mountain View, CA.', '2 Stanford University, Stanford, CA.', '3 Stanford and Google Brain, Google Inc., Stanford, CA.']","Niru Maheswaranathan, Alex H Williams, Matthew D Golub, Surya Ganguli, David Sussillo, ",Advances in neural information processing systems,2019 Dec,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32782423
1663,What are the main patient safety concerns of healthcare stakeholders: a mixed-method study of Web-based text,"Objectives:
      
    

    
      Various healthcare stakeholders define quality of care in different ways. Public policy could advocate all these concerns. This study was conducted to identify the main themes on patient safety of stakeholders expressed before and after the Patient Safety Act was enacted in Korea in 2015. Design:
      
    

    
      Longitudinal observational study of the interests of healthcare stakeholders generated between January 2014 and September 2018. Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      Text data were collected from 2,487 documents on 18 websites that were identified as representative healthcare stakeholder groups of consumers, providers, government, and researchers. A Korean natural language processing (NLP) package, manual review, and synonym dictionary were used for data preprocessing, and we adopted the unsupervised NLP method of probabilistic topic modeling and latent Dirichlet allocation. A linear trend analysis over time, a qualitative step involving two external experts, and original text reviews were performed to validate the identified topics. Results:
      
    

    
      Forty-one topics were identified, and the most common concerns of stakeholders were institutional infection control as triggered by the Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak in early 2015, and infusion-related infection from late 2017 until the middle of 2018. The other top-three concerns of the stakeholder groups were highly similar, while research topics were limited to the perceptions of providers and the activities and culture of hospitals. Five topics showed statistically significant increasing trends over time, while another five showed decreasing trends (both P < 0.05). In the qualitative step, we confirmed 35 themes and revised the other 6. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      A common concern among stakeholders was hospital infection control, ranging from nosocomial infections to those brought in by family visiting patients. Government policies and systemic approaches to patient safety were highlighted by different stakeholders. Researchers were focused on hospital sociocultural factors at both the organizational and clinician levels. These identified concerns all should be advocated by the public health policy.","['1 Department of Nursing, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea.

      Patients undergoing amputation of the lower extremity for the complications of peripheral artery disease and/or diabetes are at risk of treatment failure and the need for reamputation at a higher level. The aim of this study was to develop a patient-specific reamputation risk prediction model. Methods:
      
    

    
      Patients with incident unilateral transmetatarsal, transtibial or transfemoral amputation between 2004 and 2014 secondary to diabetes and/or peripheral artery disease, and who survived 12 months after amputation, were identified using Veterans Health Administration databases. Procedure codes and natural language processing were used to define subsequent ipsilateral reamputation at the same or higher level. Stepdown logistic regression was used to develop the prediction model. It was then evaluated for calibration and discrimination by evaluating the goodness of fit, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and discrimination slope. Results:
      
    

    
      Some 5260 patients were identified, of whom 1283 (24·4 per cent) underwent ipsilateral reamputation in the 12 months after initial amputation. Crude reamputation risks were 40·3, 25·9 and 9·7 per cent in the transmetatarsal, transtibial and transfemoral groups respectively. The final prediction model included 11 predictors (amputation level, sex, smoking, alcohol, rest pain, use of outpatient anticoagulants, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, white blood cell count, kidney failure and previous revascularization), along with four interaction terms. Evaluation of the prediction characteristics indicated good model calibration with goodness-of-fit testing, good discrimination (AUC 0·72) and a discrimination slope of 11·2 per cent. Conclusion:
      
    

    
      A prediction model was developed to calculate individual risk of primary healing failure and the need for reamputation surgery at each amputation level. This model may assist clinical decision-making regarding amputation-level selection.","['1 Veterans Affairs (VA) Center for Limb Loss and Mobility (CLiMB), VA Puget Sound Health Care System, Seattle, USA.', '2 Rehabilitation Care Services, VA Puget Sound Health Care System, Seattle, USA.', '3 Department of Rehabilitation, University of Washington, Portland, Oregon, USA.', '4 Department of Biostatistics, University of Washington, Portland, Oregon, USA.', '5 Center for Veteran-Centered and Value-Driven Care, VA Puget Sound Health Care System, Seattle, USA.', '6 Health Services Research and Development, VA Puget Sound Health Care System, Seattle, USA.', '7 Department of Epidemiology, University of Washington, Portland, Oregon, USA.', '8 Epidemiologic Research and Information Center, VA Puget Sound Health Care System, Seattle, USA.', '9 Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Portland, Oregon, USA.', '10 Department of Surgery, Division of Vascular Surgery, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon, USA.', '11 Adult and Child Consortium for Outcomes Research and Delivery Science, University of Colorado, Denver, Colorado, USA.', '12 Spectrum Research, Tacoma, USA.']","J M Czerniecki, M L Thompson, A J Littman, E J Boyko, G J Landry, W G Henderson, A P Turner, C Maynard, K P Moore, D C Norvell, ",The British journal of surgery,2019 Jul,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31134619

Then, the analysis focuses on studies, systems, and approaches that have investigated the role of dialogue systems and conversational agents in the interaction with elderly people with dementia by presenting the results of a literature review. While the overview of spoken dialogue systems relies on existing surveys and reviews, a research was conducted to identify existing works in the literature that have investigated the role of conversational agents and dialogue systems in the elderly and people with cognitive impairments. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) use of conversational agents, dialogue systems, or language processing tools for people with cognitive impairments; (2) age ≥60 years; (3) diagnosis of dementia according to National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association (NIAAA) criteria; (4) presence of tests or experiments with qualitative or quantitative results. Initially 125 studies published between 2000 and 2017 were identified, of which 12 met the inclusion criteria. The review identifies the issues and challenges that are reported when conversational agents and speech-based interfaces have been used for interacting with people with cognitive impairments.

Are predictable words genuinely predicted, or simply more plausible and therefore easier to integrate with sentence context? We addressed this persistent and fundamental question using data from a recent, large-scale (n = 334) replication study, by investigating the effects of word predictability and sentence plausibility on the N400, the brain's electrophysiological index of semantic processing. A spatio-temporally fine-grained mixed-effect multiple regression analysis revealed overlapping effects of predictability and plausibility on the N400, albeit with distinct spatio-temporal profiles. Our results challenge the view that the predictability-dependent N400 reflects the effects of either prediction or integration, and suggest that semantic facilitation of predictable words arises from a cascade of processes that activate and integrate word meaning with context into a sentence-level meaning.

1668,Machine Learning in Mass Spectrometric Analysis of DIA Data,"Liquid Chromatography coupled to Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) based methods are currently the top choice for high-throughput, quantitative measurements of the proteome. While traditional proteomics LC-MS/MS methods can suffer from issues such as low reproducibility and quantitative accuracy due to its stochastic nature, recent improvements in acquisition protocols have resulted in methods that can overcome these challenges. Data-independent acquisition (DIA) is a novel mass spectrometric method that does so by using a deterministic acquisition strategy. These new approaches will allow researchers to apply MS on more complex samples, however, existing heuristic and expert-knowledge based methods will struggle with keeping pace of the increasing complexity of the resulting data. Deep learning (DL) based methods have been shown to be more adept at handling large amounts of complex data than traditional methods in many other fields, such as computer vision and natural language processing. Proteomics is also entering a phase where the size and complexity of the data will require us to look towards scalable and data-driven DL pipelines.","['1 The Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Biomolecular Research, University of Toronto, 160 College Street, Room 230, Toronto, Ontario, M5S 3E1, Canada.']","Leon L Xu, Adamo Young, Audrina Zhou, Hannes L Röst, ",Proteomics,2020,data independent acquisition; deep learning; machine learning; proteomics.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32061181
1669,Automatically Identifying Comparator Groups on Twitter for Digital Epidemiology of Pregnancy Outcomes,"Despite the prevalence of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as miscarriage, stillbirth, birth defects, and preterm birth, their causes are largely unknown. We seek to advance the use of social media for observational studies of pregnancy outcomes by developing a natural language processing pipeline for automatically identifying users from which to select comparator groups on Twitter. We annotated 2361 tweets by users who have announced their pregnancy on Twitter, which were used to train and evaluate supervised machine learning algorithms as a basis for automatically detecting women who have reported that their pregnancy had reached term and their baby was born at a normal weight. Upon further processing the tweet-level predictions of a majority voting-based ensemble classifier, the pipeline achieved a user-level F1-score of 0.933 (precision = 0.947, recall = 0.920). Our pipeline will be deployed to identify large comparator groups for studying pregnancy outcomes on Twitter.","['1 Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', '2 Department of Sociology, Anthropology, and Health Administration and Policy, University of Maryland, Baltimore County, Baltimore, MD, USA.']","Ari Z Klein, Abeselom Gebreyesus, Graciela Gonzalez-Hernandez, ",AMIA Joint Summits on Translational Science proceedings.

1670,Machine learning and big scientific data,"This paper reviews some of the challenges posed by the huge growth of experimental data generated by the new generation of large-scale experiments at UK national facilities at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) site at Harwell near Oxford. Such 'Big Scientific Data' comes from the Diamond Light Source and Electron Microscopy Facilities, the ISIS Neutron and Muon Facility and the UK's Central Laser Facility. Increasingly, scientists are now required to use advanced machine learning and other AI technologies both to automate parts of the data pipeline and to help find new scientific discoveries in the analysis of their data. For commercially important applications, such as object recognition, natural language processing and automatic translation, deep learning has made dramatic breakthroughs. Google's DeepMind has now used the deep learning technology to develop their AlphaFold tool to make predictions for protein folding. Remarkably, it has been able to achieve some spectacular results for this specific scientific problem. Can deep learning be similarly transformative for other scientific problems? After a brief review of some initial applications of machine learning at the RAL, we focus on challenges and opportunities for AI in advancing materials science. Finally, we discuss the importance of developing some realistic machine learning benchmarks using Big Scientific Data coming from several different scientific domains. We conclude with some initial examples of our 'scientific machine learning' benchmark suite and of the research challenges these benchmarks will enable.

1671,Effect of Cognitive Style on Language Control During Joint Language Switching: An ERP Study,"The current study aims to investigate how Field independent (FI) and Field-dependent (FD) cognitive styles modulate bilingual language control during a joint language switching task. The cognitive styles were measured by the Group Embedded Figures Test (GEFT). The FI group with a preference for autonomous information processing was sensitive to role switching earlier at the cue stage, eliciting a more negative-going N2 in the cross-person condition than in the within-person condition. While the FD group, with a holistic processing style, discerned such role switching later, inducing a more positive-going late positive component (LPC) in the cross-person condition. In addition, the FD group exercised more cognitive control to suppress the interference from the L1 lemma, indexed by larger LPC amplitudes for L2 switch trials than L1 switch trials in the within-person condition. These findings suggest that FDI cognitive styles modulate bilingual language control mechanism through different manners of information processing.","['1 Research Center of Brain and Cognitive Neuroscience, Liaoning Normal University, Dalian, 116029, China.', '2 Department of Linguistics, Faculty of Human Sciences, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia.', '3 Department of Linguistics, University of Kansas, Lawrence, USA.', '4 Research Center of Brain and Cognitive Neuroscience, Liaoning Normal University, Dalian, 116029, China. abcde69503@126.com.']","Man Zhang, Xin Wang, Fenqi Wang, Huanhuan Liu, ",Journal of psycholinguistic research,2020 Jun,Cognitive style; LPC; Language control; N2.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31836959

Other fields of research (such as computer vision and natural language processing) have established various competitions and public benchmarks. Recent availability of large clinical datasets has enabled the possibility of establishing public benchmarks. Taking advantage of this opportunity, we propose a public benchmark suite to address four areas of critical care, namely mortality prediction, estimation of length of stay, patient phenotyping and risk of decompensation. We define each task and compare the performance of both clinical models as well as baseline and deep learning models using eICU critical care dataset of around 73,000 patients. This is the first public benchmark on a multi-centre critical care dataset, comparing the performance of clinical gold standard with our predictive model. We also investigate the impact of numerical variables as well as handling of categorical variables on each of the defined tasks. The source code, detailing our methods and experiments is publicly available such that anyone can replicate our results and build upon our work.","['1 University of Trento, Trento, Italy.', '2 Fondazione Bruno Kessler Research Institute, Trento, Italy.']","Seyedmostafa Sheikhalishahi, Vevake Balaraman, Venet Osmani, ",PloS one,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32614874
1674,Medical Concept Representation Learning from Multi-source Data,"Representing words as low dimensional vectors is very useful in many natural language processing tasks. This idea has been extended to medical domain where medical codes listed in medical claims are represented as vectors to facilitate exploratory analysis and predictive modeling. However, depending on a type of a medical provider, medical claims can use medical codes from different ontologies or from a combination of ontologies, which complicates learning of the representations. To be able to properly utilize such multi-source medical claim data, we propose an approach that represents medical codes from different ontologies in the same vector space. We first modify the Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) measure of similarity between the codes. We then develop a new negative sampling method for word2vec model that implicitly factorizes the modified PMI matrix. The new approach was evaluated on the code cross-reference problem, which aims at identifying similar codes across different ontologies. In our experiments, we evaluated cross-referencing between ICD-9 and CPT medical code ontologies. Our results indicate that vector representations of codes learned by the proposed approach provide superior cross-referencing when compared to several existing approaches.","['1 Department of Computer and Information Sciences, Temple University, USA.', '2 Fox Chase Cancer Center, USA.']","Tian Bai, Brian L Egleston, Richard Bleicher, Slobodan Vucetic, ",IJCAI : proceedings of the conference,2019 Jul,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32116463
1675,A network-centric approach for estimating trust between open source software developers,"Trust between developers influences the success of open source software (OSS) projects. Although existing research recognizes the importance of trust, there is a lack of an effective and scalable computational method to measure trust in an OSS community. Consequently, OSS project members must rely on subjective inferences based on fragile and incomplete information for trust-related decision making. We propose an automated approach to assist a developer in identifying the trustworthiness of another developer. Our two-fold approach, first, computes direct trust between developer pairs who have interacted previously by analyzing their interactions via natural language processing. Second, we infer indirect trust between developers who have not interacted previously by constructing a community-wide developer network and propagating trust in the network. A large-scale evaluation of our approach on a GitHub dataset consisting of 24,315 developers shows that contributions from trusted developers are more likely to be accepted to a project compared to contributions from developers who are distrusted or lacking trust from project members. Further, we develop a pull request classifier that exploits trust metrics to effectively predict the likelihood of a pull request being accepted to a project, demonstrating the practical utility of our approach.","['1 Software Engineering, Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, NY, United States of America.', '2 Intelligent Systems-EWI, Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands.']","Hitesh Sapkota, Pradeep K Murukannaiah, Yi Wang, ",PloS one,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31887172
1676,Using Natural Language Processing Techniques to Provide Personalized Educational Materials for Chronic Disease Patients in China: Development and Assessment of a Knowledge-Based Health Recommender System,"Background:
      
    

    
      Health education emerged as an important intervention for improving the awareness and self-management abilities of chronic disease patients. The development of information technologies has changed the form of patient educational materials from traditional paper materials to electronic materials. To date, the amount of patient educational materials on the internet is tremendous, with variable quality, which makes it hard to identify the most valuable materials by individuals lacking medical backgrounds. Objective:
      
    

    
      The aim of this study was to develop a health recommender system to provide appropriate educational materials for chronic disease patients in China and evaluate the effect of this system. Methods:
      
    

    
      A knowledge-based recommender system was implemented using ontology and several natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The development process was divided into 3 stages. In stage 1, an ontology was constructed to describe patient characteristics contained in the data. In stage 2, an algorithm was designed and implemented to generate recommendations based on the ontology. Patient data and educational materials were mapped to the ontology and converted into vectors of the same length, and then recommendations were generated according to similarity between these vectors. In stage 3, the ontology and algorithm were incorporated into an mHealth system for practical use. Keyword extraction algorithms and pretrained word embeddings were used to preprocess educational materials. Three strategies were proposed to improve the performance of keyword extraction. System evaluation was based on a manually assembled test collection for 50 patients and 100 educational documents. Recommendation performance was assessed using the macro precision of top-ranked documents and the overall mean average precision (MAP). Results:
      
    

    
      The constructed ontology contained 40 classes, 31 object properties, 67 data properties, and 32 individuals. A total of 80 SWRL rules were defined to implement the semantic logic of mapping patient original data to the ontology vector space. The recommender system was implemented as a separate Web service connected with patients' smartphones. According to the evaluation results, our system can achieve a macro precision up to 0.970 for the top 1 recommendation and an overall MAP score up to 0.628. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      This study demonstrated that a knowledge-based health recommender system has the potential to accurately recommend educational materials to chronic disease patients. Traditional NLP techniques combined with improvement strategies for specific language and domain proved to be effective for improving system performance. One direction for future work is to explore the effect of such systems from the perspective of patients in a practical setting.","['1 Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Biomedical Engineering, College of Biomedical Engineering and Instrument Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', '2 Engineering Research Center of Cognitive Healthcare of Zhejiang Province (Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital), Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', '3 General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, China.', '4 Sir Run-Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.']","Zheyu Wang, Haoce Huang, Liping Cui, Juan Chen, Jiye An, Huilong Duan, Huiqing Ge, Ning Deng, ",JMIR medical informatics,2020,chronic disease; health education; natural language processing; ontology; recommender system.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32324148
1677,Multiple features for clinical relation extraction: A machine learning approach,"Relation extraction aims to discover relational facts about entity mentions from plain texts. In this work, we focus on clinical relation extraction; namely, given a medical record with mentions of drugs and their attributes, we identify relations between these entities. We propose a machine learning model with a novel set of knowledge-based and BioSentVec embedding features. We systematically investigate the impact of these features with standard distance- and word-based features, conducting experiments on two benchmark datasets of clinical texts from MADE 2018 and n2c2 2018 shared tasks. For comparison with the feature-based model, we utilize state-of-the-art models and three BERT-based models, including BioBERT and Clinical BERT. Our results demonstrate that distance and word features provide significant benefits to the classifier. Knowledge-based features improve classification results only for particular types of relations. The sentence embedding feature provides the largest improvement in results, among other explored features on the MADE corpus. The classifier obtains state-of-the-art performance in clinical relation extraction with F-measure of 92.6%, improving F-measure by 3.5% on the MADE corpus.","['1 Kazan Federal University, 18 Kremlyovskaya Street, Kazan 420008, Russian Federation.

1678,Broadening horizons: the case for capturing function and the role of health informatics in its use,"Background:
      
    

    
      Human activity and the interaction between health conditions and activity is a critical part of understanding the overall function of individuals. The World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) models function as all aspects of an individual's interaction with the world, including organismal concepts such as individual body structures, functions, and pathologies, as well as the outcomes of the individual's interaction with their environment, referred to as activity and participation. Function, particularly activity and participation outcomes, is an important indicator of health at both the level of an individual and the population level, as it is highly correlated with quality of life and a critical component of identifying resource needs. Since it reflects the cumulative impact of health conditions on individuals and is not disease specific, its use as a health indicator helps to address major barriers to holistic, patient-centered care that result from multiple, and often competing, disease specific interventions. While the need for better information on function has been widely endorsed, this has not translated into its routine incorporation into modern health systems. Purpose:
      
    

    
      We present the importance of capturing information on activity as a core component of modern health systems and identify specific steps and analytic methods that can be used to make it more available to utilize in improving patient care. We identify challenges in the use of activity and participation information, such as a lack of consistent documentation and diversity of data specificity and representation across providers, health systems, and national surveys. We describe how activity and participation information can be more effectively captured, and how health informatics methodologies, including natural language processing (NLP), can enable automatically locating, extracting, and organizing this information on a large scale, supporting standardization and utilization with minimal additional provider burden. We examine the analytic requirements and potential challenges of capturing this information with informatics, and describe how data-driven techniques can combine with common standards and documentation practices to make activity and participation information standardized and accessible for improving patient care. Recommendations:
      
    

    
      We recommend four specific actions to improve the capture and analysis of activity and participation information throughout the continuum of care: (1) make activity and participation annotation standards and datasets available to the broader research community; (2) define common research problems in automatically processing activity and participation information; (3) develop robust, machine-readable ontologies for function that describe the components of activity and participation information and their relationships; and (4) establish standards for how and when to document activity and participation status during clinical encounters. We further provide specific short-term goals to make significant progress in each of these areas within a reasonable time frame.","['1 Rehabilitation Medicine Department, National Institutes of Health, Mark O.

1679,"Differences in statin utilization and lipid lowering by race, ethnicity, and HIV status in a real-world cohort of persons with human immunodeficiency virus and uninfected persons","Background:
      
    

    
      Risks for cardiovascular diseases, including myocardial infarction and stroke, are elevated in people with HIV infection (PWH). However, no trials of statin utilization with clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) end points have been completed in PWH, and there are sparse real-world data regarding statin use and lipid-lowering effectiveness. We therefore used a unique cohort of PWH and uninfected controls to evaluate (1) differences in statin types used for PWH versus uninfected persons; (2) lipid lowering achieved by statin use for PWH versus uninfected persons; and (3) racial and ethnic disparities in appropriate statin use among PWH and uninfected persons. Methods:
      
    

    
      We analyzed a cohort of 5,039 PWH and 10,011 uninfected demographically matched controls who received care at a large urban medical center between January 1, 2000, and May 17, 2017. Medication administration records, prescription data, and validated natural language processing algorithms were used to determine statin utilization. Statins were categorized by generic active ingredient name and intensity (high, moderate, or low). Lipid values collected in routine clinical care were available for analysis. The first set of analyses was restricted to PWH and uninfected matched controls taking statins and compared (1) differences in statin type and (2) difference in cholesterol levels after versus before statin initiation by HIV status. For the second set of analyses, we first used prevalent CVD risk factors to determine participants with statin indications and then determined how many of these participants were taking statins. We then compared statin utilization among persons with indications for statins by race/ethnic group for PWH and uninfected matched controls using multivariable-adjusted logistic regression. Results:
      
    

    
      Among people prescribed statins, PWH were more likely than controls to have ever taken pravastatin (34.8% vs 12.3%, P < .001) or atorvastatin (72.2% vs 65.6%, P = .002) and less likely to have ever taken simvastatin (14.2% vs 39.5%, P < .001). Among PWH with indications for statin utilization, 55.7% of whites, 39.4% of blacks, and 45.8% of Hispanics were prescribed statins (P < .001). These differences in statin prescription by race/ethnicity remained significant after adjustment for demographics (including insurance status), cardiovascular risk factors, antiretroviral therapy use, HIV viremia, and CD4 count. These racial/ethnic disparities in statin utilization were less pronounced among uninfected persons. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Among PWH with statin indication(s), blacks and Hispanics were less likely than whites to have been prescribed a statin. These racial/ethnic disparities were less pronounced among uninfected persons. There were significant differences in type of statin used for PWH compared to uninfected matched controls. Future efforts addressing disparities in CVD prevention among PWH are warranted.","['1 Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL.', '2 Northwestern Medicine Enterprise Data Warehouse, Chicago, IL.', '3 University of Texas - Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX.', '4 Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN.', '5 Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL.

1680,Digital Surveillance for Monitoring Environmental Health Threats: A Case Study Capturing Public Opinion from Twitter about the 2019 Chennai Water Crisis,"Globally, water scarcity has become a common challenge across many regions. Digital surveillance holds promise for monitoring environmental threats to population health due to severe drought. The 2019 Chennai water crisis in India resulted in severe disruptions to social order and daily life, with local residents suffering due to water shortages. This case study explored public opinion captured through the Twitter social media platform, and whether this information could help local governments with emergency response. Sentiment analysis and topic modeling were used to explore public opinion through Twitter during the 2019 Chennai water crisis. The latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) method identified topics that were most frequently discussed. A naïve Tweet classification method was built, and Twitter posts (called tweets) were allocated to identified topics. Topics were ranked, and corresponding emotions were calculated. A cross-correlation was performed to examine the relationship between online posts about the water crisis and actual rainfall, determined by precipitation levels. During the Chennai water crisis, Twitter users posted content that appeared to show anxiety about the impact of the drought, and also expressed concerns about the government response. Twitter users also mentioned causes for the drought and potential sustainable solutions, which appeared to be mainly positive in tone. Discussion on Twitter can reflect popular public opinion related to emerging environmental health threats. Twitter posts appear viable for informing crisis management as real-time data can be collected and analyzed. Governments and public health officials should adjust their policies and public communication by leveraging online data sources, which could inform disaster prevention measures.","['1 Department of Biostatistics, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN 37203, USA.', '2 Computational Epidemiology Lab, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.', ""3 Innovation Program, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA 02215, USA."", '4 Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA.', '5 Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA.', '6 Department of Global Health and Social Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']","Jiangmei Xiong, Yulin Hswen, John A Naslund, ",International journal of environmental research and public health,2020,crisis; digital surveillance; disasters; natural language processing; public opinion; social media; water.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32674441

      Harnessing engagement in online searching and social media may provide complementary information for monitoring alcohol use, informing prevention and policy evaluation, and extending knowledge available from national surveys. Methods:
      
    

    
      Relative search volumes for 7 alcohol-related keywords were estimated from Google Trends (data, 2014-2017), and the proportion of alcohol use-related Twitter posts (data, 2014-2015) was estimated using natural language processing. Searching/posting measures were created for all 50 U.S. states plus Washington, D.C. Survey reports of alcohol use and summaries of state alcohol policies were obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (data, 2014-2016) and the Alcohol Policy Scale. In 2018-2019, associations among searching/posting measures and same state/year Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System reports of recent (past-30-day) alcohol use and maximum number of drinks consumed on an occasion were estimated using logistic and linear regression, adjusting for sociodemographics and Internet use, with moderation tested in regressions that included interactions of select searching/posting measures and the Alcohol Policy Scale. Results:
      
    

    
      Recent alcohol use was reported by 52.93% of 1,297,168 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System respondents, which was associated with all state-level searching/posting measures in unadjusted and adjusted models (p<0.0001). Among drinkers, most searching/posting measures were associated with maximum number of drinks consumed (p<0.0001). Associations varied with exposure to high versus low levels of state policy controls on alcohol. Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Strong associations were found among individual alcohol use and state-level alcohol-related searching/posting measures, which were moderated by the strength of state alcohol policies. Findings support using novel personally generated data to monitor alcohol use and possibly evaluate effects of alcohol control policies.","[""1 Division of Adolescent/Young Adult Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts; Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts; Computational Health Informatics Program, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.

1682,Parallel Structure Deep Neural Network Using CNN and RNN with an Attention Mechanism for Breast Cancer Histology Image Classification,"In this paper, we present a new deep learning model to classify hematoxylin-eosin-stained breast biopsy images into four classes (normal tissues, benign lesions, in situ carcinomas, and invasive carcinomas). Our model uses a parallel structure consist of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a recurrent neural network (RNN) for image feature extraction, which is greatly different from the common existed serial method of extracting image features by CNN and then inputting them into RNN. Then, we introduce a special perceptron attention mechanism, which is derived from the natural language processing (NLP) field, to unify the features extracted by the two different neural network structures of the model. In the convolution layer, general batch normalization is replaced by the new switchable normalization method. And the latest regularization technology, targeted dropout, is used to substitute for the general dropout in the last three fully connected layers of the model. In the testing phase, we use the model fusion method and test time augmentation technology on three different datasets of hematoxylin-eosin-stained breast biopsy images. The results demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.","['1 School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming 650091, China.']","Hongdou Yao, Xuejie Zhang, Xiaobing Zhou, Shengyan Liu, ",Cancers,2019,DenseNet; LSTM; attention; biopsy image; breast cancer; switchable normalization; targeted dropout; test time augmentation.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31795390
1683,Relevant Word Order Vectorization for Improved Natural Language Processing in Electronic Health Records,"Electronic health records (EHR) represent a rich resource for conducting observational studies, supporting clinical trials, and more. However, much of the data contains unstructured text, presenting an obstacle to automated extraction. Natural language processing (NLP) can structure and learn from text, but NLP algorithms were not designed for the unique characteristics of EHR. Here, we propose Relevant Word Order Vectorization (RWOV) to aid with structuring. RWOV is based on finding the positional relationship between the most relevant words to predicting the class of a text. This facilitates machine learning algorithms to use the interaction of not just keywords but positional dependencies (e.g. a relevant word occurs 5 relevant words before some term of interest). As a proof-of-concept, we attempted to classify the hormone receptor status of breast cancer patients treated at the University of Kansas Medical Center, comparing RWOV to other methods using the F1 score and AUC. RWOV performed as well as, or better than other methods in all but one case. For F1 score, RWOV had a clear edge on most tasks. AUC tended to be closer, but for HER2, RWOV was significantly better for most comparisons. These results suggest RWOV should be further developed for EHR-related NLP.","['1 Department of Biostatistics & Data Science, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS, USA. jthompson21@kumc.edu.', '2 University of Kansas Cancer Center, Kansas City, KS, USA. jthompson21@kumc.edu.', '3 Department of Biostatistics & Data Science, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS, USA.', '4 University of Kansas Cancer Center, Kansas City, KS, USA.']","Jeffrey Thompson, Jinxiang Hu, Dinesh Pal Mudaranthakam, David Streeter, Lisa Neums, Michele Park, Devin C Koestler, Byron Gajewski, Roy Jensen, Matthew S Mayo, ",Scientific reports,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31239489
1684,DISNET: a framework for extracting phenotypic disease information from public sources,"Background:
      
    

    
      Within the global endeavour of improving population health, one major challenge is the identification and integration of medical knowledge spread through several information sources. The creation of a comprehensive dataset of diseases and their clinical manifestations based on information from public sources is an interesting approach that allows one not only to complement and merge medical knowledge but also to increase it and thereby to interconnect existing data and analyse and relate diseases to each other. In this paper, we present DISNET (http://disnet.ctb.upm.es/), a web-based system designed to periodically extract the knowledge from signs and symptoms retrieved from medical databases, and to enable the creation of customisable disease networks. Methods:
      
    

    
      We here present the main features of the DISNET system. We describe how information on diseases and their phenotypic manifestations is extracted from Wikipedia and PubMed websites; specifically, texts from these sources are processed through a combination of text mining and natural language processing techniques. Results:
      
    

    
      We further present the validation of our system on Wikipedia and PubMed texts, obtaining the relevant accuracy. The final output includes the creation of a comprehensive symptoms-disease dataset, shared (free access) through the system's API. We finally describe, with some simple use cases, how a user can interact with it and extract information that could be used for subsequent analyses. Discussion:
      
    

    
      DISNET allows retrieving knowledge about the signs, symptoms and diagnostic tests associated with a disease. It is not limited to a specific category (all the categories that the selected sources of information offer us) and clinical diagnosis terms. It further allows to track the evolution of those terms through time, being thus an opportunity to analyse and observe the progress of human knowledge on diseases. We further discussed the validation of the system, suggesting that it is good enough to be used to extract diseases and diagnostically-relevant terms. At the same time, the evaluation also revealed that improvements could be introduced to enhance the system's reliability.","['1 Centro de Tecnología Biomédica, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Pozuelo de Alarcón, Madrid, Spain.', '2 Escuela Técnica Superior de Ingenieros Informáticos, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Boadilla del Monte, Madrid, Spain.']","Gerardo Lagunes-García, Alejandro Rodríguez-González, Lucía Prieto-Santamaría, Eduardo P García Del Valle, Massimiliano Zanin, Ernestina Menasalvas-Ruiz, ",PeerJ,2020,Disease understanding; Disnet framework; Natural language processing; Phenotypic information; Public sources.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32110491
