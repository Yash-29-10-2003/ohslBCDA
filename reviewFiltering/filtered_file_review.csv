"Breast Cancer: Risk Assessment, Screening, and Primary Prevention.","Michaels, Worthington, Rusiecki","Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36759097/,"This review provides an outline of a risk-based approach to breast cancer screening and prevention. All women should be assessed for breast cancer risk starting at age 18. Patients can then be stratified into average, moderate, and high-risk groups. Counseling on breast awareness and lifestyle changes is recommended for all women.","This review provides an outline of a risk-based approach to breast cancer screening and prevention. All women should be assessed for breast cancer risk starting at age 18 with identification of modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors. Patients can then be stratified into average, moderate, and high-risk groups with personalized screening and prevention plans. Counseling on breast awareness and lifestyle changes is recommended for all women, regardless of risk category. High-risk individuals may benefit from additional screening modalities such as MRI and chemoprevention and should be managed closely by a multidisciplinary team."
Breastfeeding and Reduced Risk of Breast Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Qiu, Zhong, Hu, Wu","Journal Article, Meta-Analysis, Systematic Review, Retracted Publication",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35126640/,"meta-analysis was carried out on the basis of published literature from clinical trials and studies among different parts of the world. Menarche age, family history, lactation duration, and menopausal status have a strong effect on the risks of breast cancer.","Evidences which prove relation between breastfeeding women and risk of breast cancer have been limited. A meta-analysis was carried out on the basis of published literature from clinical trials and studies among different parts of the world. Studies were analyzed and extracted using PRISMA flowchart. RevMan 5.4.1 was used for analyzing the extracted data. Included studies were fully cited texts with complete information about studies, trails conducted for risk of breast cancer, and breastfeeding correlations. Menarche age, family history, lactation duration, and menopausal status have a strong effect on the risks of breast cancer. Family history studies concluded that for 95% CI, the risk ratio was 2.66 (2.00, 3.52). Findings have suggested that family history and lactation duration affect the risks of breast cancer."
Impact of Soy Foods on the Development of Breast Cancer and the Prognosis of Breast Cancer Patients.,Messina,"Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27161216/,The relationship between soy food intake and breast cancer has been rigorously investigated for more than 25 years. Observational studies show that among Asian women higher soy consumption is associated with an approximate 30% reduction in risk of developing breast cancer.,"The relationship between soy food intake and breast cancer has been rigorously investigated for more than 25 years. The identification of isoflavones as possible chemopreventive agents helped fuel this line of investigation. These diphenolic compounds, which are found in uniquely-rich amounts in soy beans, possess both estrogen-dependent and -independent properties that potentially inhibit the development of breast cancer. Observational studies show that among Asian women higher soy consumption is associated with an approximate 30% reduction in risk of developing breast cancer. However, evidence suggests that for soy to reduce breast cancer risk consumption must occur early in life, that is during childhood and/or adolescence. Despite the interest in the role of soy in reducing breast cancer risk concerns have arisen that soy foods, because they contain isoflavones, may increase the likelihood of high-risk women developing breast cancer and worsen the prognosis of breast cancer patients. However, extensive clinical and epidemiologic data show these concerns to be unfounded. Clinical trials consistently show that isoflavone intake does not adversely affect markers of breast cancer risk, including mammographic density and cell proliferation. Furthermore, prospective epidemiologic studies involving over 11,000 women from the USA and China show that postdiagnosis soy intake statistically significantly reduces recurrence and improves survival."
Breast cancer risk accumulation starts early: prevention must also.,"Colditz, Bohlke, Berkey","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24820413/,Nearly one in four breast cancers is diagnosed before the age of 50. Breast tissue undergoes rapid cellular proliferation between menarche and first full-term pregnancy. Risk accumulates rapidly until the terminal differentiation that accompanies first pregnancy.,"Nearly one in four breast cancers is diagnosed before the age of 50, and many early-stage premalignant lesions are present but not yet diagnosed. Therefore, we review evidence to support the strategy that breast cancer prevention efforts must begin early in life. This study follows the literature review methods and format. Exposures during childhood and adolescence affect a woman's long-term risk of breast cancer, but have received far less research attention than exposures that occur later in life. Breast tissue undergoes rapid cellular proliferation between menarche and first full-term pregnancy, and risk accumulates rapidly until the terminal differentiation that accompanies first pregnancy. Evidence on childhood diet and growth in height, and adolescent alcohol intake, among other adolescent factors is related to breast cancer risk and risk of premalignant proliferative benign lesions. Breast cancer prevention efforts will have the greatest effect when initiated at an early age and continued over a lifetime. Gaps in knowledge are identified and deserve increase attention to inform prevention."
Executive Summary of the Early-Onset Breast Cancer Evidence Review Conference.,"Chelmow, Pearlman, Young, Bozzuto, Dayaratna, Jeudy, Kremer, Scott, O'Hara","Journal Article, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S., Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32459439/,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention launched the Bring Your Brave campaign to increase knowledge about early-onset breast cancer. This article summarizes the relevant literature, existing guidance, and validated tools to guide health care providers in the prevention, early detection, and special considerations.","The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention launched the Bring Your Brave campaign to increase knowledge about early-onset breast cancer, defined as breast cancer in women aged 18-45 years. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists convened a panel of experts in breast disease from the Society for Academic Specialists in General Obstetrics and Gynecology to review relevant literature, validated tools, best practices, and practice guidelines as a first step toward developing educational materials for women's health care providers about early-onset breast cancer. Panel members conducted structured literature reviews, which were then reviewed by other panel members and discussed at an in-person meeting of stakeholder professional and patient advocacy organizations in April 2019. This article summarizes the relevant literature, existing guidance, and validated tools to guide health care providers in the prevention, early detection, and special considerations of early-onset breast cancer. Substantive knowledge gaps were noted and summarized to provide guidance for future research."
Association between diet during preadolescence and adolescence and risk for breast cancer during adulthood.,Mahabir,"Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23298994/,"Only a few epidemiologic studies have been conducted on the relationship between diet during preadolescence and adolescence, and cancer during adulthood. Research on preadolescent and adolescent diet is a paradigm shift in breast cancer investigations. This research paradigm has the potential to produce transformative knowledge.","It is increasingly evident that diet during preadolescence and adolescence has important consequences for breast cancer during adulthood. However, only a few epidemiologic studies have been conducted on the relationship between diet during preadolescence and adolescence, and cancer during adulthood. This situation is partly because of methodological challenges such as the long latency period, the complexity of breast cancer, the lack of validated diet assessment tools, and the large number of subjects that must be followed, all of which increase costs. In addition, funding opportunities are few for such studies. Results from the small number of epidemiologic studies are inconsistent, but evidence is emerging that specific aspects of the diet during preadolescence and adolescence are important. For example, during preadolescence and adolescence, severe calorie restriction with poor food quality, high total fat intake, and alcohol intake tend to increase risk, whereas high soy intake decreases risk. Research on preadolescent and adolescent diet is a paradigm shift in breast cancer investigations. This research paradigm has the potential to produce transformative knowledge to inform breast cancer prevention strategies through dietary intervention during preadolescence and adolescence, rather than later in life, as is current practice, when it is perhaps less effective. Methodological challenges that have plagued the field might now be overcome by leveraging several existing large-scale cohort studies in the U.S. and around the world to investigate the role of diet during preadolescence and adolescence in risk for adult breast cancer."
"Physical activity and breast cancer risk: impact of timing, type and dose of activity and population subgroup effects.","Friedenreich, Cust","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18487249/,"A review of all published literature to September 2007 was conducted using online databases. Evidence for a risk reduction associated with increased physical activity was found in 47 (76%) of 62 studies. Stronger decreases in risk were observed for recreational activity, lifetime or later life activity, vigorous activity, among postmenopausal women, women with normal BMI, non-white racial groups.","To review (1) the epidemiological literature on physical activity and the risk of breast cancer, examining the effect of the different parameters of activity and effect modification within different population subgroups; and (2) the biological mechanisms whereby physical activity may influence the risk of breast cancer. A review of all published literature to September 2007 was conducted using online databases; 34 case-control and 28 cohort studies were included. The impact of the different parameters of physical activity on the association between activity and the risk of breast cancer was examined by considering the type of activity performed, the timing of activity over the life course and the intensity of activity. Effect modification of this association by menopausal status, body mass index (BMI), racial group, family history of breast cancer, hormone receptor status, energy intake and parity were also considered. Evidence for a risk reduction associated with increased physical activity was found in 47 (76%) of 62 studies included in this review with an average risk decrease of 25-30%. A dose-response effect existed in 28 of 33 studies. Stronger decreases in risk were observed for recreational activity, lifetime or later life activity, vigorous activity, among postmenopausal women, women with normal BMI, non-white racial groups, those with hormone receptor negative tumours, women without a family history of breast cancer and parous women. The effect of physical activity on the risk of breast cancer is stronger in specific population subgroups and for certain parameters of activity that need to be further explored in future intervention trials."
Physical Activity in Young BRCA Carriers and Reduced Risk of Breast Cancer.,"Bucy, Valencia, Howe, Larkin, Conard, Anderlik, Valdivi, Bea","Systematic Review, Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35738959/,"A systematic literature review was conducted to determine whether physical activity levels during adolescent and young adult years were associated with a reduced lifetime risk of breast cancer. Ovid/MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, WOS, and CINAHL were searched for articles. A total of 1,957 unique articles were identified.","A systematic literature review was conducted to determine whether physical activity levels during adolescent and young adult years were associated with a reduced lifetime risk of breast cancer among carriers of deleterious mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Ovid/MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, WOS, and CINAHL were searched for articles including information about adolescent and young adult physical activity and breast cancer incidence among women carrying deleterious BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations (search was initiated in October 2019; last update and full analyses were in March 2021). Independent reviewers screened articles at the title/abstract and full-text levels, resolving differences by consensus with lead authors. The NIH Quality Assessment Tools were used to assess sources of bias. A total of 1,957 unique articles were identified; 5 met inclusion criteria. Samples size ranged from 68 to 1,185. All studies relied on self-reported adolescent and young adult physical activity. One study measured sports involvement; the others measured recreational activity. One large study was null, whereas 4 others showed a reduction in breast cancer incidence later in life with higher adolescent and young adult physical activity (pâ‰¤0.05). However, the protection was limited to premenopausal breast cancer in 1 of the studies (OR=0.62; 95% CI=0.40, 0.96; p-trend=0.01). In addition, adolescent and young adult physical activity was associated with older age at breast cancer diagnosis in 1 study (p=0.03). A limited number of studies suggest that adolescent and young adult physical activity may reduce or delay the risk of breast cancer incidence among carriers of deleterious mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes."
Modifiable Risk Factors for the Development of Breast Cancer in Young Women.,"Cathcart-Rake, Ruddy, Johnson","Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30480572/,"Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among adolescents and young adults (AYAs) women aged 15 to 39 years at diagnosis. A literature review was conducted to report upon associations between modifiable lifestyle factors and breast cancer risk. Higher levels of physical activity, lower red meat intake, and higher intake of plants appear to decrease the risk of developing AYA breast cancer.","Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among adolescents and young adults (AYAs) women aged 15 to 39 years at diagnosis. An improved understanding of modifiable factors that mitigate the risks of the development of breast cancer may allow for future strategies to reduce the incidence of AYA breast cancer. A literature review was conducted to report upon associations between modifiable lifestyle factors and breast cancer risk. Higher levels of physical activity, lower red meat intake, and higher intake of plants appear to decrease the risk of developing AYA breast cancer, whereas associations between obesity and AYA breast cancer risk were less straightforward. Further research, ideally in large prospective trials, is needed to truly understand modifiable risk factors for the development of AYA breast cancer."
Breast cancer prevention: a review of current evidence.,Vogel,"Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10901739/,The National Cancer Institute has created a breast cancer risk assessment tool. Women who are candidates for a preventive course of tamoxifen must be counseled. Prophylactic mastectomy offers at least a 90% reduction in the risk of breast cancer.,"The National Cancer Institute has created a breast cancer risk assessment tool that quickly estimates a woman's individualized absolute risk of developing breast cancer. Understanding the magnitude of risk is important because recent data show that breast cancer incidence may be reduced. All women may improve their overall health and thus perhaps minimize breast cancer risk by maintaining a healthy weight, avoiding cigarettes, limiting alcohol consumption, getting regular exercise, and avoiding non-diagnostic ionizing radiation. Nevertheless, no lifestyle modifications have yet been proven to prevent or definitively lower the risk of breast cancer. In addition, women whose personal breast cancer risk is high may consider reducing risk by pharmacologic or surgical means. In such women, a five-year course of tamoxifen reduced the risk of invasive breast cancer by 49%; women with lobular carcinoma in situ or atypical hyperplasia experienced even greater risk reductions. Because of the potential for vascular and endometrial side effects, women who are candidates for a preventive course of tamoxifen must be counseled regarding its relative risks and benefits. Prophylactic mastectomy offers at least a 90% reduction in the risk of breast cancer, but the physical and psychological changes involved in such a procedure make it a difficult choice for many women. Breast cancer risk assessment and appropriate counseling are becoming standard components of breast cancer screening and overall health maintenance."
Physical activity in adolescence and young adulthood and breast cancer risk: a quantitative review.,"Lagerros, Hsieh, Hsieh","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15075782/,Physical activity in 12-24-year-old females significantly reduces risk of breast cancer. Each one-hour increase of recreational physical activity/week during adolescence was associated with a 3% (95% CI 0-6%) risk reduction.,"Physical activity habits are potentially modifiable and could therefore be targeted in a primary prevention strategy against breast cancer, provided there is causality and a sufficiently strong relationship. Our objective of this quantitative review was to provide a summary estimate of the association of moderate/vigorous recreational physical activity during adolescence/young adulthood with breast cancer risk, and to determine whether a dose-response relationship exists. Data sources included studies in humans relating physical activity to breast cancer risk, published between January 1966 and October 2002, identified on Medline, the Web of Science, from reference lists and related reviews. The main characteristics of each study, the point estimates of relative risk (RR) and confidence intervals (CI) were extracted from 19 case-control and four cohort studies. Comparing the highest to the lowest category of physical activity, the summary RR from the random effects model was 0.81 (95% CI 0.73-0.89). This almost 20% risk reduction proved to be fairly consistent, despite variation in populations and methods. Each one-hour increase of recreational physical activity/week during adolescence was associated with a 3% (95% CI 0-6%) risk reduction. Physical activity in 12-24-year-old females significantly reduces risk of breast cancer. Heterogeneity may be explained by different methods to measure activity."
Identifying opportunities for cancer prevention during preadolescence and adolescence: puberty as a window of susceptibility.,"Biro, Deardorff","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23601607/,"Epidemiologic studies document an association between exposures at critical windows of susceptibility with outcomes as diverse as childhood and adult obesity, timing of menarche, and risk for hypertension or breast cancer. The long-term sequela of responses to early exposures may impact other adult morbidities.","Early life exposures during times of rapid growth and development are recognized increasingly to impact later life. Epidemiologic studies document an association between exposures at critical windows of susceptibility with outcomes as diverse as childhood and adult obesity, timing of menarche, and risk for hypertension or breast cancer. This article briefly reviews the concept of windows of susceptibility for providers who care for adolescent patients. The theoretical bases for windows of susceptibility is examined, evaluating the relationship between pubertal change and breast cancer as a paradigm, and reviewing the underlying mechanisms, such as epigenetic modification. The long-term sequela of responses to early exposures may impact other adult morbidities; addressing these exposures represents an important challenge for contemporary medicine."
"The menopause, hormone replacement therapy and breast cancer.",Marsden,"Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12650709/,Concern exists that the reduction in breast cancer risk associated with the onset of the menopause will be negated with exposure to hormone replacement therapy (HRT) Evidence from large-scale randomised HRT trials support observational data. HRT has not been associated conclusively with a predominance of hormone sensitive breast cancer.,"Concern exists that the reduction in breast cancer risk associated with the onset of the menopause will be negated with exposure to hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Evidence from large-scale randomised HRT trials support observational data that have shown a modest increase in breast cancer risk with long-term use (i.e. >15 years) of combined therapy, although this falls following HRT cessation suggesting a growth-promoting effect. Randomised evidence demonstrates that the efficacy of anti-estrogens, aromatase inhibitors and raloxifene in the treatment and chemoprevention of breast cancer are restricted to women with oestrogen receptor positive (ER +ve) disease; however, HRT has not been associated conclusively with a predominance of hormone sensitive breast cancer. Despite stimulating the breast cancer cell growth, HRT has not been shown to increase breast cancer recurrence or mortality when prescribed to breast cancer survivors experiencing oestrogen deficiency symptoms and randomised trials have been recommended and commenced. In conjunction with controlled breast cancer trials demonstrating a therapeutic benefit of high dose estrogens and interest in the use of additive oestrogen therapy in patients developing resistance to oestrogen deprivation, the dogma that HRT is an absolute contra-indication following diagnosis is challenged."
Menstrual cycling and breast cancer: an evolutionary perspective.,Strassmann,"Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S., Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10100133/,"This article attempts to bridge the disciplinary gap between evolutionary biology and clinical studies of women's health. The specific focus is on the relationship between breast cancer and exposure to ovarian hormones during normal menstrual cycling. This point is illustrated by data on the Dogon of Mali, a traditional West African population.","This article attempts to bridge the disciplinary gap between evolutionary biology and clinical studies of women's health. The resulting dialogue is predicted to have useful implications for research aimed at the prevention of women's reproductive cancers. The specific focus is on the relationship between breast cancer and exposure to ovarian hormones during normal menstrual cycling. The clinician's view of normal cycling is radically different from that uncovered by evolutionary studies of noncontracepting populations. This point is illustrated by data on the Dogon of Mali, a traditional West African population with a mean of 8.6 +/- 0.3 live births per woman. The Dogon data include hormonal profiles (urinary estrone-3-glucuronide and pregnanediol-3-glucuronide) of 93 women (sampled twice weekly for 10 weeks) and a census of women's visits to menstrual huts (n = 736 days). Dogon women menstruated regularly only if they were sterile. Otherwise, women aged 20-34 years had a median of only two menses each over the 2-year study period. The median number of menses per lifetime was approximately 100, about a third as many as experienced by an American woman who had three live births. These results contribute to a growing body of evidence that women's bodies were designed by natural selection to spend most of the time in lactational amenorrhea and add support to the view that contraceptives can be made safer if they forego the hormonal swings associated with menstruation. This conclusion is further reinforced by evidence that menstrual bleeding serves no adaptive purpose."
"[Secondary cancers: Incidence, risk factors and recommendations].","Demoor-Goldschmidt, Fayech, Girard, Plantaz","English Abstract, Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25911942/,"Cure rates for most childhood cancers and adolescents have made remarkable progress. The development of secondary malignancies has become an important question for these patients. The frequency is low, but the risk is significantly higher (between 3 and 10 times)","Cure rates for most childhood cancers and adolescents have made remarkable progress over the last thirty to forty years. The development of secondary malignancies has become an important question for these patients. The frequency is low, but the risk is significantly higher (between 3 and 10 times) and it is the leading cause of long-term mortality off relapse. In this literature review, we discuss the epidemiological aspect and the risk factors contributing to this increased risk, and conclude with a summary of current recommendations for screening and surveillance. We also discuss briefly the constitutional predisposing genetic contributions to other cancers."

Prospects for the primary prevention of breast cancer.,"Bernstein, Ross, Henderson","Journal Article, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S., Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1311141/,"The goal is to reduce the number of ovulatory menstrual cycles a woman experiences in order to reduce her exposure to estrogen and progesterone. Physical activity during adolescence is proposed as a nonhormonal method of accomplishing this. Tamoxifen, which is effective in breast cancer therapy, provides endocrine control of estrogen-regulated breast tumor growth.","In this paper, the rationale, stage of development, and known or potential adverse effects of three potential strategies for the prevention of breast cancer are reviewed. Two methods--the use of tamoxifen in postmenopausal women and the use of luteinizing hormone (LH)-releasing hormone agonists in premenopausal women--involve hormonal manipulation. In the premenopausal period, the goal is to reduce the number of ovulatory menstrual cycles a woman experiences in order to reduce her exposure to estrogen and progesterone. Physical activity during adolescence is proposed as a nonhormonal method of accomplishing this. The use of LH-releasing hormone agonists to produce a reversible menopause can also reduce a woman's cumulative exposure to ovarian steroid hormones. Tamoxifen, which is effective in breast cancer therapy, provides endocrine control of estrogen-regulated breast tumor growth. Breast cancer chemoprevention trials using tamoxifen among postmenopausal women have been proposed, and pilot studies are under way."
[Vitamin D and breast cancer: is there a link?].,"Stoll, Akladios, Mathelin","Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23562418/,"The sun exposure, via the skin vitamin D synthesis, is associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer. An inverse relationship between plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH-D) level and breast cancer risk has been suggested. Recommendations concerning a vitamin D supplementation could be established.","The aim of this review is to know the relationship between breast cancer and vitamin D, synthesised by skin or brought by food or supplementation. The selected articles were extracted from the Pubmed database between 1998 and 2012. The keywords used were: ""25-hydroxyvitamin D"", ""breast cancer recurrence"", ""breast cancer risk"", ""serum levels of vitamin D"", ""vitamin D intake"". A total of 37 articles were selected. The sun exposure, via the skin vitamin D synthesis, is associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer. This decrease seems also likely for food contributions and an over 400IU per day vitamin D supplementation. An inverse relationship between plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH-D) level and breast cancer risk has been suggested. An increased 25-OH-D level seems associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer recurrence.

The role of body size and physical activity on the risk of breast cancer in BRCA mutation carriers.,"Pettapiece-Phillips, Narod, Kotsopoulos","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25579073/,"Women who inherit a BRCA mutation face a high lifetime risk of developing breast cancer. Given the high penetrance of these mutations, prevention is of extreme importance. There is some evidence to support a protective role of a healthy body size.","Women who inherit a BRCA mutation face a high lifetime risk of developing breast cancer. Given the high penetrance of these mutations, prevention is of extreme importance. Here, we review the literature regarding the role of body size and of physical activity in the context of BRCA-associated breast cancer. There is some evidence to support a protective role of a healthy body size and of regular physical activity among mutation carriers, particularly during adolescence or early adulthood. Factors which increase the physiologic expression of the normal copy of the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene and thereby normalize protein levels, contribute to stem cell homeostasis, and/or affect hormone levels, might mitigate the effects of an inherited BRCA mutation. Preliminary evidence from one in vivo study and from one epidemiologic report suggests that an increase in BRCA1 mRNA expression occurs with increasing levels of physical activity. The prospect of changing lifestyle for the purpose of preventing breast cancer in high-risk women, complemented by mechanistic evidence, warrants evaluation in large-scale prospective studies."
Physical Activity and Risk of Breast Cancer: A Meta-Analysis of 38 Cohort Studies in 45 Study Reports.,"Chen, Wang, Zhang, Xie, Tan","Journal Article, Meta-Analysis, Systematic Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30661625/,A systematic review meta-analysis was conducted. The literature was independently and manually searched by 2 reviewers through 3 English databases. The quality of included studies was assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Fixed-effects models were used to estimate the pooled relative risk.,"To evaluate and quantify the association between physical activity (PA) and risk of breast cancer. A systematic review meta-analysis was conducted. The literature was independently and manually searched by 2 reviewers through 3 English databases (PubMed, Embase, and ISI Web of Science) for data till October 2017. The quality of included studies was assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Fixed-effects models were used to estimate the pooled relative risk and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Dose-response analysis was chosen for quantifying the association between PA and risk of breast cancer. The Begg test and the Egger test were used to estimate potential publication bias. Heterogeneity between studies was evaluated with I<sup>2</sup> statistics. The meta-analysis included 38 cohort studies published between 1994 and 2017, which included 68 416 breast cancer cases. The overall relative risk (ORR) for breast cancer was 0.87 (95% CI 0.84-0.90). The inverse association was consistent among all subgroup analyses. In subgroup analysis by menopausal status, the ORR of breast cancer was 0.83 (95% CI 0.79-0.87) for premenopausal status and 0.91 (95% CI 0.85-0.97) for postmenopausal status. In subgroup analysis by PA type, the ORR for total activity was 0.87 (95% CI 0.81-0.93), for recreational activity 0.88 (95% CI 0.85-0.91), for occupational activity 0.91 (95% CI 0.84-0.99), and for nonoccupational activity 0.87 (95% CI 0.83-0.92). The risk of breast cancer was significantly lower in people with exposure periods longer than 1 year and less than 5 years (ORR 0.62; 95% CI 0.46-0.78), followed by those with lifetime activity (ORR 0.81; 95% CI 0.69-0.93). The ORR for subjects with body mass index of less than 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (0.88; 95% CI 0.83-0.93) was close to that for subjects with body mass index of more than 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (0.87; 95% CI 0.77-0.97). A linear relationship was found between breast cancer risk and PA (recreational activity and total activity), and the ORR was reduced by 3% (95% CI 0.95-0.99) for every 10 metabolic equivalent of energy hours per week increment in recreational PA and by 2% (95% CI 0.97-0.99) for every 10 metabolic equivalent of energy hours per week increment in total PA. PA is significantly associated with a decrease in the risk of breast cancer."
Emerging worldwide trends of breast cancer incidence in the 1970s and 1980s: data from 23 cancer registration centres.,Gjorgov,"Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8287006/,"The aim of the study was to estimate the change in breast cancer incidence around the world in the last two decades.

Research of drugs which could be effective, with little toxicity, and having a positive impact on cardiovascular disease or bone is an important issue.","Tamoxifen as adjuvant hormonal therapy after hormonosensitive-breast cancer surgery is well established nowadays, as well as its efficacy in first-line therapy of advanced hormonosensitive breast cancers. Research of drugs which could be effective, with little toxicity, and having a positive impact on cardiovascular disease or bone is an important issue. New drugs are in development or will soon be on the market to permit second or third lines of treatment with respect to effectiveness and quality of life, such as new anti-estrogens or selective estrogen receptors modulators or aromatase inhibitors. Their principal characteristics are reviewed through recent data. Prevention of breast cancer is a pertinent question and major publications are presented. Finally, the controversy about the possible reintroduction of replacement hormonal therapy after breast cancer will be questioned through trials."
Decision-making for bilateral risk-reducing mastectomy for an increased lifetime breast cancer risk: A qualitative metasynthesis.,"Torrisi, Wareg, Anbari","Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38429973/,"For women with a genetic mutation that increases their predisposition for a breast cancer diagnosis, bilateral risk-reducing mastectomy (BRRM) is the most effective prevention strategy. However, BRRM can change a woman's breast appearance and function.","Previvor is a term applied to a person with an identified, elevated lifetime cancer risk but without an actual cancer diagnosis. Previvorship entails the selection of risk management strategies. For women with a genetic mutation that increases their predisposition for a breast cancer diagnosis, bilateral risk-reducing mastectomy (BRRM) is the most effective prevention strategy. However, BRRM can change a woman's breast appearance and function. The purpose of this qualitative metasynthesis (QMS) was to better understand the decision-making process for BRRM among previvors. A theory-generating QMS approach was used to analyze and synthesize qualitative findings. Research reports were considered for inclusion if: (1) women over 18 years of age possessed a genetic mutation increasing lifetime breast cancer risk or a strong family history of breast cancer; (2) the sample was considering, or had completed, BRRM; (3) the results reported qualitative findings. Exclusion criteria were male gender, personal history of breast cancer, and research reports which did not separate findings based on cancer diagnosis and/or risk-reduction surgery. A theory and corresponding model emerged, comprised of seven themes addressing the decision-making process for or against BRRM. While some factors to decision-making were decisive for surgery, others were more indefinite and contributed to women changing, processing, or suspending their decision-making for a period of time. Regardless of the decision previvors make about BRRM, physical and psychosocial well-being should be considered and promoted through shared decision-making in the clinical setting."

With nearly 90% of the actions carried out, this Plan was marked by the collective mobilisation of all stakeholders to reduce the burden of cancer in our country. Real successes have been recorded. But the progress made must not make us forget the pain and suffering endured by those affected by this disease, their families, loved ones and caregivers. Cancer continues to be a life-changing experience for those who face it. In this fight, progress in medicine, research, the quality and safety of care, progress in social support, support in returning to work and to a normal life are all hopes for all patients and their loved ones. They have only been possible thanks to the mobilisation of everyone and the dedication of the care teams. Many battles have been fought over the years and the results obtained are the best encouragement to continue the efforts. We must now amplify and improve our collective action. The ambitious objective of massively reducing the burden of cancer in the lives of the French must mobilise us all for the next decade."
"Macronutrient supplements may reduce breast cancer risk: how, when and which?",Stoll,"Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9306082/,"Both obesity and the Western diet are likely to stimulate insulin resistance, leading to increased levels of bioavailable estrogen. Increased intake of fibre-associated macronutrients may reduce insulin resistance in addition to reducing the circulating levels of estrogen. Soy protein constituents have been shown to inhibit the growth of rat mammary cancer models and also of human breast cancer cell line.","To examine evidence that specific fibre-associated macronutrients are associated with a decreased breast cancer risk. To review possible mechanisms, the age group when dietary intervention might be most effective and the choice of a suitable dietary supplement. This review distinguishes specific hormone-metabolic effects of dietary composition from those of body mass and fat distribution, in relation to the age at which they exert major effects on breast cancer risk. Both obesity and a high-fat/low-fibre diet in Western women may be associated with increased estrogen levels which are widely assumed to increase the risk of developing breast cancer. Both obesity and the Western diet are likely to stimulate insulin resistance, leading to increased levels of bioavailable estrogen. The concomitants of hyperinsulinemia may synergize with estrogen in stimulating progression of pre-neoplastic lesions in the breasts of late pre-menopausal women. Increased intake of fibre-associated macronutrients may reduce insulin resistance in addition to reducing the circulating levels of estrogen. The effect of dietary intervention on breast cancer risk in Western women may be tested in pre-menopausal women over the age of 40 y, with evidence of atypical hyperplasia in a breast biopsy. The most suitable fibre-associated macronutrient is still problematical but soy protein constituents have been shown to inhibit the growth of rat mammary cancer models and also of human breast cancer cell line in the laboratory."

To help these women during their decision process, several patient decision aids (DA) were developed and evaluated in the last 15 years. Until now, there is no conclusive evidence on the effectiveness of these DA.","Female BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers have an increased lifetime risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer. Hence, they face the difficult decision of choosing a preventive strategy such as risk-reducing surgeries or intensified breast screening. To help these women during their decision process, several patient decision aids (DA) were developed and evaluated in the last 15 years. Until now, there is no conclusive evidence on the effectiveness of these DA. This study aims 1) to provide the first systematic literature review about DA addressing preventive strategy decisions for female BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, 2) to analyze the quality of the existing evidence, 3) to evaluate the effects of DA on decision and information related outcomes, on the actual choice for preventive measure and on health outcomes. A systematic literature review was conducted using six electronic databases (inclusion criteria: DA addressing preventive strategies, female BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, 18 to 75 years, knowledge of test result). The quality of the included randomized controlled trials (RCT) was evaluated with the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool. The quality of included one-group pretest-posttest design studies was evaluated with the ROBINS-I tool. Outcomes of included studies were extracted and qualitatively summarized. A total of 2093 records were identified. Six studies were included for further evaluation (5 RCT, 1 one-group pretest-posttest design study). One RCT was formally included, but data presentation did not allow for further analyses. The risk of bias was high in three RCT and unclear in one RCT. The risk of bias in the one-group pretest-posttest study was serious. The outcome assessment showed that the main advantages of DA are linked to the actual decision process: Female BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers using a DA had less decisional conflict, were more likely to reach a decision and were more satisfied with their decision. Decision aids can support female BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers during their decision process by significantly improving decision related outcomes. More high-quality evidence is needed to evaluate possible effects on information related outcomes, health outcomes and the actual choice for preventive measures."

Reproductive factors such as early menarche, late age at first full term birth, nulliparity, and late age at menopause increase risk of breast cancer, but manipulation of any one of these factors does not seem to be a realistic preventive tool. Nevertheless, the future possibility of using tamoxifen as a chemopreventive agent against breast cancer is discussed, particularly in relation to women at increased risk due to familial clustering. Alcohol consumption by young women, and overweight among postmenopausal women may also increase the incidence of breast cancer. Consequently, reduced alcohol intake by young women, and weight reduction among overweight women after menopause may reduce the risk of breast cancer."

The initial third of the article considers: activity and prevention definitions; historical evidence showing physical inactivity is detrimental to health and normal organ functional capacities; cause versus treatment; physical activity and inactivity mechanisms differ; gene-environment interaction (including aerobic training adaptations, personalized medicine, and co-twin physical activity); and specificity of adaptations to type of training. Next, physical activity/exercise is examined as primary prevention against 35 chronic conditions [accelerated biological aging/premature death, low cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max), sarcopenia, metabolic syndrome, obesity, insulin resistance, prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, coronary heart disease, peripheral artery disease, hypertension, stroke, congestive heart failure, endothelial dysfunction, arterial dyslipidemia, hemostasis, deep vein thrombosis, cognitive dysfunction, depression and anxiety, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, balance, bone fracture/falls, rheumatoid arthritis, colon cancer, breast cancer, endometrial cancer, gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, polycystic ovary syndrome, erectile dysfunction, pain, diverticulitis, constipation, and gallbladder diseases]. The article ends with consideration of deterioration of risk factors in longer-term sedentary groups; clinical consequences of inactive childhood/adolescence; and public policy. In summary, the body rapidly maladapts to insufficient physical activity, and if continued, results in substantial decreases in both total and quality years of life. Taken together, conclusive evidence exists that physical inactivity is one important cause of most chronic diseases. In addition, physical activity primarily prevents, or delays, chronic diseases, implying that chronic disease need not be an inevitable outcome during life."

Although largely asymptomatic, some types of HPVs (HPV-16, HPV-18) which infect the genitalia are known to cause cancers, including cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is an important public health concern and is the second most clinically important cancer to breast cancer in women aged 15-44 years. Until recently, cervical cancer strategies focussed on screening. However, as adolescents become sexually active at a much younger age, the focus is on the use of vaccination as an effective measure to prevent progression of HPV infection to cancer. HPV is also involved in the aetiology of cancers of the anus, vagina, vulva and penis as well as genital warts and laryngeal papillomatosis in young children. Primary prevention through vaccination is now possible in Europe using either the quadrivalent HPV vaccine, GardasilÂ® (Sanofi Pasteur MSD), or the bivalent HPV vaccine, CervarixÂ® (GSK), which are both highly immunogenic, with their effects persisting for at least 5 years. HPV vaccines are well tolerated, with serious vaccine-related events occurring in less than 0.1% of patients for both vaccines. Here, we review the possibilities for utilising vaccination programmes alongside current cervical cancer screening in comprehensive cervical cancer prevention programmes.

We summarised the existing evidence on SMBC after childhood cancer in a systematic review and investigated the risk of SMBC among males in a Pan-European cohort. We searched Medline/PubMed for cohort studies and case reports/series that assessed SMBC after childhood cancer (â‰¤21 years). Furthermore, we analysed data on SMBC in the PanCareSurFup cohort, reporting standardised incidence ratios (SIRs), absolute excess risks (AERs), and 5- and 10-year survival rates. The systematic review included 38 of 7080 potentially eligible articles. Cohort-specific SMBC frequencies were 0-0.40% (31 studies). SMBC occurred after a follow-up ranging from 24.0 to 42.0 years. Nine case reports/series described 11 SMBC cases, occurring 11.0-42.5 years after primary childhood cancer. In the PanCareSurFup cohort (16 SMBC/37,738 males; 0.04%), we observed a 22.3-fold increased risk of SMBC relative to the general male population (95% CI 12.7-36.2; absolute excess risk/100,000 person-years: 2.3, 95% CI 1.3-3.7). The five- and ten-year survival rates after SMBC diagnosis were 60.3% (95% CI 35.6%-85.0%) and 43.0% (95% CI 16.1%-69.9%), respectively. Clear evidence of risk factors did not emerge from these comprehensive efforts. Compared to the general population, male CCSs have an elevated risk of developing subsequent breast cancer, although the absolute risk is low. Health care providers should be aware of this rare yet serious late effect; male CCSs with symptoms potentially related to SMBC warrant careful examination."

By frequency, pulmonary cancer and gastrointestinal and genitourinary tract neoplasms are the most responsible for the reported AM. Improvements in oncologic patient care favor an increase in the incidence of such rare cases. We performed a systematic review of acrometastases to the hand to provide further insight into the management of these fragile patients. We also present a peculiar case of simultaneous acrometastasis to the ring finger and pathological vertebral fracture. <i>Material and Methods:</i> A literature search according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement was conducted using the PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus databases in December 2020 on metastasis to the hand and wrist, from 1986 to 2020. MeSH terms included acrometastasis, carpal metastasis, hand metastasis, finger metastasis, phalangeal metastasis, and wrist metastasis. <i>Results:</i> In total, 215 studies reporting the follow-up of 247 patients were analyzed, with a median age of 62 years (range 10-91 years). Overall, 162 out of 247 patients were males (65.6%) and 85 were females (34.4%). The median reported follow-up was 5 months (range 0.5-39). The median time from primary tumor diagnosis to acrometastasis was 24 months (range 0.7-156). Acrometastases were located at the finger/phalanx (68.4%), carpal (14.2%), metacarpal (14.2%), or other sites (3.2%). The primary tumors were pulmonary in 91 patients (36.8%). The average interval from primary tumor diagnosis to acrometastasis varied according to the primary tumor type from 2 months (in patients with mesenchymal tumors) to 64.0 months (in patients with breast cancer). <i>Conclusions:</i> Acrometastases usually develop in the late stage of oncologic disease and are associated with short life expectancy. Their occurrence can no longer be considered rare; physicians should thus be updated on their surgical management and their impact on prognosis and survival."

Tamoxifen, which is effective in breast cancer therapy, provides endocrine control of estrogen-regulated breast tumor growth.","In this paper, the rationale, stage of development, and known or potential adverse effects of three potential strategies for the prevention of breast cancer are reviewed. Two methods--the use of tamoxifen in postmenopausal women and the use of luteinizing hormone (LH)-releasing hormone agonists in premenopausal women--involve hormonal manipulation. In the premenopausal period, the goal is to reduce the number of ovulatory menstrual cycles a woman experiences in order to reduce her exposure to estrogen and progesterone. Physical activity during adolescence is proposed as a nonhormonal method of accomplishing this. The use of LH-releasing hormone agonists to produce a reversible menopause can also reduce a woman's cumulative exposure to ovarian steroid hormones. Tamoxifen, which is effective in breast cancer therapy, provides endocrine control of estrogen-regulated breast tumor growth. Breast cancer chemoprevention trials using tamoxifen among postmenopausal women have been proposed, and pilot studies are under way."

Recently, studies have begun to evaluate whether early life exposures might also impact the risk of developing benign breast disease (BBD). A diagnosis of proliferative BBD independent of other breast cancer risk factors also increases the subsequent risk of breast cancer; therefore, understanding how to decrease the incidence of BBD may have important implications for primary breast cancer prevention. We reviewed several studies from prospective cohort studies that have investigated the relationship between risk factors during childhood and adolescence, such as anthropometric and reproductive characteristics as well as diet and other behaviors, and subsequent risk of BBD. Higher intake of vegetable oils, nuts, vitamin E, and fiber and lower consumption of animal fat, red meat, and alcohol are associated with reduced risk of BBD. Childhood weight and adolescent body mass index are inversely associated with BBD risk, whereas a greater peak height velocity during adolescence is associated with a higher risk of BBD. There was no association between age of menarche and risk of BBD. Early life exposures and behaviors appear to impact BBD risk. The current body of evidence further supports the importance of a life-course approach to breast cancer prevention."

The aim of PHEs is to identify risk factors and early signs of disease, but also to prevent future illness by early intervention. Therefore, each PHE should include counselling, immunisation and physical examination according to the patient's age and gender. However, deciding whether to screen a patient and choosing the most appropriate screening method can be challenging for general practitioners.

The aim of this review is to provide an updated statement of recommendations regarding preventive care measures based mostly on the guidelines derived from the USPSTF and the Swiss Medical Board. Among the major updates, there is no recommendation anymore to routinely screen for breast cancer and prostate cancer in asymptomatic adults. Since 2013, however, the USPSTF recommends annual screening for lung cancer with low-dose CT in patients aged 55 to 80 years with a smoking history of â‰¥30 pack years. During PHEs, the physician should be alert to the patients' hidden agendas, which are the reason for one third of all consultations in primary care."

POI has been associated with neurological dysfunction and an increased risk of dementia. Findings related to loss of cognitive function after chemotherapy or GnRH treatments are mixed.,"Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) involves loss of ovarian function before age 40. POI has been associated with neurological dysfunction and an increased risk of dementia, perhaps due to depletion in estrogen levels. The present review discusses the effects of POI caused by genetic disorder, natural premature menopause, surgical menopause, breast cancer treatment and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist treatment. Overall, data suggest an increased risk of neurological disorder where POI is due to premature menopause or induced from surgery. This increased risk appears to be most apparent on domains of global cognitive and verbal memory tests. Where POI is caused by genetic disorder, observed cognitive deficiencies may be more likely to have a genetic basis rather than being due to the effects of sex steroids on the brain. Findings related to loss of cognitive function after chemotherapy or GnRH treatments are mixed. There are also discrepant data related to use of hormone therapy after POI (particularly after surgical menopause). After surgery, hormone treatment appears to be most beneficial if initiated close to the average natural age of menopause."

Our objective of this quantitative review was to provide a summary estimate of the association of moderate/vigorous recreational physical activity during adolescence/young adulthood with breast cancer risk, and to determine whether a dose-response relationship exists. Data sources included studies in humans relating physical activity to breast cancer risk, published between January 1966 and October 2002, identified on Medline, the Web of Science, from reference lists and related reviews. The main characteristics of each study, the point estimates of relative risk (RR) and confidence intervals (CI) were extracted from 19 case-control and four cohort studies. Comparing the highest to the lowest category of physical activity, the summary RR from the random effects model was 0.81 (95% CI 0.73-0.89). This almost 20% risk reduction proved to be fairly consistent, despite variation in populations and methods. Each one-hour increase of recreational physical activity/week during adolescence was associated with a 3% (95% CI 0-6%) risk reduction. Physical activity in 12-24-year-old females significantly reduces risk of breast cancer. Heterogeneity may be explained by different methods to measure activity."

The current study provides cancer statistics and their trends in Yemen, including incidence and mortality, in 2020 by using descriptive statistics. The data was obtained using the Global Cancer Observatory (GCO) 2020 online database. According to the (GCP) database in 2020, the crude incidence rate (CIR) of all cancers in Yemen was 55.2 per 100.000. The age-standardized rate (ASR) was 97.0 per 100.000, and the cumulative risk (0-74) was 22.0 per 100.000.

Breast cancer risk is felt to originate from chest wall radiation exposure prior to the third decade of life, with incidence beginning to rise approximately eight to ten years following Hodgkin lymphoma treatment. Although incidence varies according to age at radiation exposure, dosage, and treatment fields, cohort studies have documented a cumulative incidence of breast cancer of 10-20% by 40 years of age. Women with a history of chest radiation for Hodgkin lymphoma are counselled to begin screening with bilateral breast MRI at 25 years of age, or eight years after radiation, whichever occurs later. Outside of high-risk surveillance, the optimal management approach for women with prior radiation exposure continues to evolve. When diagnosed with breast malignancy, evidence supports consideration of unilateral therapeutic and contralateral prophylactic mastectomy, although breast conserving surgery may be considered following multidisciplinary assessment. This review will address the epidemiology, characteristics, screening and management guidelines, and breast-cancer prevention efforts for Hodgkin lymphoma survivors treated with radiation therapy in adolescence and young adulthood."

Efforts are needed to translate global recommendations into national guidelines and implementation strategies. This article presents the current status of policy guidance for the use of PrEP during peri-conception, pregnancy and breastfeeding, with a particular focus on high prevalence countries, including those in sub-Saharan Africa. PrEP clinical guidelines released by ministries of health or other national-level health bodies, with a particular focus on recommendations for PrEP use during peri-conception, pregnancy and breastfeeding, were reviewed and summarised. Among countries with PrEP guidelines and/or policy, pregnancy is recognised as a period with increased HIV vulnerability, and some recommend PrEP use specifically during pregnancy. Only one country notes that PrEP is contraindicated during pregnancy, recognising a gap in complete safety data from women using PrEP throughout pregnancy. PrEP is not contraindicated as a peri-conception HIV prevention strategy in any country, but only three countries have specific guidance for peri-conception HIV prevention. Multiple barriers to the implementation of PrEP during pregnancy and breastfeeding are discussed, including barriers at the policy, health systems, social and personal levels. Although pregnancy is a period of heightened risk and fertility rates are high in many settings with high HIV burden, few PrEP policies have included guidance for PrEP use specific to peri-conception, pregnancy and breastfeeding periods. This gap can be overcome by the development or adoption of national clinical guidelines and implementation strategies from exemplary countries."
Risk factors for breast cancer: is ionizing radiation among them?,"Golubicic, Borojevic, Pavlovic","Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19145669/,"All human beings are exposed to the influence of ionizing radiation from natural, medical and other artificial sources. It has been known that female breast tissue is highly sensitive to the carcinogenic effects of radiation. The highest risk of radiation- induced breast cancer is evidenced in the sub-population of female patients who have undergone radiotherapy.","All human beings are exposed to the influence of ionizing radiation from natural, medical and other artificial sources. Therefore, the influence of radiation as a risk factor for cancer development has been among the most studied external factors over the last 6 decades, particularly with respect to radiosensitive tissues and organs. It has been known that female breast tissue is highly sensitive to the carcinogenic effects of radiation, particularly when exposure takes place at younger age. All women are exposed to low doses of radiation for several common reasons (kind of occupation, medical diagnostic procedures, residence background radiation) whose effects on breast cancer development cannot be documented, and thus it is believed that ionizing radiation is not primary or major risk factor leading to development of breast cancer. Radiobiological studies revealed a specific event caused by radiation through recognition of the critical target in radiation-induced carcinogenesis. Accordingly, mutagenic and carcinogenic effects of ionizing radiation are evidenced both in vitro and in vivo, although the incidence of radiation-induced cancers is low. The highest risk of radiation- induced breast cancer is evidenced in the sub-population of female patients who have undergone radiotherapy for either malignant or non-malignant diseases, including benign breast diseases in their childhood or young age. Therefore, as a means of prevention in this group of population, indications for application of ionizing radiation, both diagnostic and therapeutic, should be highly selective, meaning that radiation should be applied only if the possible benefit outweighs the risk."
Hormones and progeny of breast tumor cells.,"Schneider, BÃ¶cker","Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16698656/,The risk of breast cancer is inversely related to parity. Women during adolescence have the highest susceptibility to breast cancer development. This appears to be the period when the mammary gland has the highest number of stem cells. Stem cells may represent important targets for transformational events.,"The rudimentary human glandular breast, with the approach of puberty, starts to grow both at glandular and stromal sites. Full differentiation is a gradual process and takes many years, and is only fully attained by pregnancy. The risk of breast cancer is inversely related to parity. Women during adolescence have the highest susceptibility to breast cancer development. This appears to be the period when the mammary gland has the highest number of stem cells. Stem cells may represent important targets for transformational events. Immunohistochemistry allows for identification of the lineage-specific precursor glandular and myoepithelial cells and their differentiated progeny. Both estrogen receptor subtypes are found in epithelial cells of alveoli and ducts as well as in stromal cells. Immunophenotypia of benign proliferative breast disease favors a fundamentally different epithelial composition from that of most malignant epithelial proliferations such as atypical ductal hyperplasia, ductal carcinoma in situ, lobular neoplasia and invasive breast carcinoma. Immunophenotypical characterization of these lesions assists in distinguishing benign from malignant disease. Based on the observation of bilateral risks and frequent multifocality with atypical ductal hyperplasia, atypical lobular hyperplasia and lobular carcinoma in situ, it is suggested that these may represent risk factors as well as precursors. One should, however, realize that ductal as well as lobular premalignant breast lesions ultimately arise from stem cells in the terminal duct lobular units. Estrogen receptor-beta (ERbeta)-positive and ERalpha-negative expression characterizes the highest levels of proliferative cancer cell activity. Point mutations and alterations of co-activators and co-repressors will also determine hormone sensitivity. There is evidence for different genetic pathways in the development of ductal carcinoma in situ and lobular carcinoma in situ. While they share recurrent 16q losses, a second hit in the E-cadherin gene explains the advent of lobular lesions and their common existence with the primary ductal type. Based on our immunocytochemical observations, the most likely target cell of malignant transformation is the Ck18/18-positive and ER-negative transient cell of normal breast epithelium. Pregnancy confers a different genomic imprint to breast epithelial stem cells. Further elucidation of this mechanism may assist in developing appropriate means of breast cancer prevention.

Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Agonists for Ovarian Function Preservation in Premenopausal Women Undergoing Chemotherapy for Early-Stage Breast Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"Munhoz, Pereira, Sasse, Hoff, Traina, Hudis, Marques","Journal Article, Meta-Analysis, Review, Systematic Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26426573/,Chemotherapy may result in a detrimental effect on ovarian function and fertility in premenopausal women undergoing treatment for early-stage breast cancer (EBC) Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) have been suggested as an alternative to prevent the loss of ovarian function due to exposure to cytotoxic agents. To determine the effectiveness of GnRHa administered concurrently with chemotherapy for ovarian function preservation.,"Chemotherapy may result in a detrimental effect on ovarian function and fertility in premenopausal women undergoing treatment for early-stage breast cancer (EBC). To minimize risk of harm to ovarian function and fertility for patients in this setting, careful considerations should be made. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) have been suggested as an alternative to prevent the loss of ovarian function due to exposure to cytotoxic agents, but GnRHa use for ovarian protection in EBC patients is not fully resolved. To determine the effectiveness of GnRHa administered concurrently with chemotherapy for ovarian function preservation. PubMed, SCOPUS, and Cochrane databases were searched for studies published between January 1975 and March 2015. The abstracts of the American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting between 1995 and 2014 and the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium between 2009 and 2014 were searched as well. Prospective, randomized, clinical trials addressing the role of ovarian suppression with GnRHa in preventing early ovarian dysfunction in premenopausal women undergoing treatment for EBC were selected. Data extraction was performed independently by 2 authors. The methodology and the risk of bias were assessment based on the description of randomization method, withdrawals, and blinding process. Rate of resumption of regular menses after a minimal follow-up period of 6 months following chemotherapy was used as a surrogate to assess the incidence of ovarian dysfunction. Additional secondary outcomes included hormone levels and number of pregnancies. Risk ratio estimates were calculated based on the number of evaluable patients. Analyses were conducted using a random effect model. Seven studies were included in this analysis, totaling 1047 randomized patients and 856 evaluable patients. The use of GnRHa was associated with a higher rate of recovery of regular menses after 6 months (odds ratio [OR], 2.41; 95% CI, 1.40-4.15; P = .002) and at least 12 months (OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.33-2.59; P < .001) following the last chemotherapy cycle. The use of GnRHa was also associated with a higher number of pregnancies (OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.02-3.36; P = .04), although this outcome was not uniformly reported and fertility or rate of pregnancy was not the primary outcome in any of the trials. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists given with chemotherapy was associated with increased rates of recovery of regular menses in this meta-analysis. Evidence was insufficient to assess outcomes related to GnRHa and ovarian function and fertility and needs further investigation."

The advantages and challenges posed by this system are reviewed, particularly vis-Ã -vis the need to build consensus among regional health services as regards priorities in cancer control. Analysis of the impact of cancer in Spain enables smoking prevention and obesity reduction to be highlighted, especially among adolescents, as targets for primary prevention. Two-yearly colorectal cancer screening using the faecal occult blood test and targeting persons aged 50-69 years is a new goal that should be pursued countrywide, as should population-based breast cancer screening. Insofar as health care is concerned, the focus is on promoting and consolidating multidisciplinary cancer care based on evidence-based clinical guidelines, and on ensuring that cancer patients enjoy prompt access to diagnosis and therapy. Psychosocial support, with experience gained in several health services, should be expanded. Palliative care must be consolidated as a necessary therapy for patients who require it. Finally, the important boost to cancer research witnessed in recent years should be sustained. The approach adopted is based on building a co-operative strategy among all of Spain's autonomous regions (Comunidades AutÃ³nomas), which must then apply the interventions in their respective health services. A shared understanding of the main priorities for cancer control, through a review of the evidence and a consensus embracing all stakeholders, including scientific societies and patients' associations, is an essential step in the implementation of cancer strategy in Spain."

All states allow treatment of adolescents over 18 without parental consent and some allow treatment for special problems such as venereal disease or drug abuse before 18. The depressed adolescent often presents with behavioral problems, school failure, or medical symptoms. The medical history should include a description of the pregnancy and delivery, immunizations and childhood diseases, family history of coronary disease, sexual activity, school performance, and drug use. The physical examination should include an evaluation of growth and sexual development, blood pressure determination, a breast examination in older teenagers, and a pelvic examination if the patient is sexually active or if a gynecologic problem is suspected. All adolescent patients need a urine analysis and hematocrit test. Sexually active patients need a serologic test for syphilis, gonorrhea culture, and Papanicolaou smear. Determination of cholesterol and triglyceride are needed when there is a history of a myocardial infarction in a first-degree relative younger than age 50 years."
Prevention of allergic disease in childhood: clinical and epidemiological aspects of primary and secondary allergy prevention.,Halken,"Journal Article, Meta-Analysis, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15125698/,"The development and phenotypic expression of atopic diseases depends on a complex interaction between genetic factors, environmental exposure to allergens,and non-specific adjuvant factors, such as tobacco smoke, air pollution and infections. Preventive measures may include both exposure to allergen and adjuant risk/protective factors and pharmacological treatment.","The development and phenotypic expression of atopic diseases depends on a complex interaction between genetic factors, environmental exposure to allergens,and non-specific adjuvant factors, such as tobacco smoke, air pollution and infections. Preventive measures may include both exposure to allergens and adjuvant risk/protective factors and pharmacological treatment. These measures may address the general population, children at risk for development of atopic disease (high-risk infants), children with early symptoms of allergic disease or children with chronic disease. The objective for this review was to evaluate possible preventive measures as regards prevention of development of allergic disease in childhood--primary prevention--and also some aspects of the effect of specific allergy treatment as regards secondary prevention in children with allergic asthma and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. In one prospective observational study of a birth cohort of unselected infants we evaluated possible predictive/risk factors. In two prospective intervention studies including 1 yr birth cohorts of high-risk(HR) infants we investigated the effect of feeding HR infants exclusively breast milk (BM) and/or hydrolyzed cow's milk-based formula the first 4-6 months as regards: (i) the allergy preventive effect of BM/extensively hydrolysed formula (eHF) compared with ordinary cow's milk-based formula, (ii) the effect of two different eHFs, a whey (Profylac) and a casein-based (Nutramigen) formula, as regards development of cow's milk protein allergy (CMA), and (iii) a comparison of the preventive effect of eHF (Profylac/Nutramigen) with a partially hydrolyzed cow's milk-based formula (pHF) (NanHA) as regards development of CMA. None of the mothers had a restricted diet during pregnancy or lactation period. In two prospective randomized intervention studies we evaluated the preventive effect of specific allergen avoidance and specific immunotherapy (SIT) in children with allergic asthma and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, respectively. The combination of atopic heredity and elevated cord blood IgE resulted in the best predictive discrimination as regards development of allergic disease. The optimal high-risk group was defined by either double parental atopic predisposition or single atopic predisposition, the latter combined with a cord blood IgE > or = 0.3 kU/1. 66% of unselected infants were daily exposed to tobacco smoke, which was a significant risk factor for recurrent wheezing until the age of 1.5 yr. HR infants were breastfed for a longer period and less exposed to tobacco smoke than unselected infants. Exclusively BM/eHF for at least 4 months was associated with a significantly reduced cumulative prevalence of CMA [3.6% (5/141) vs. 20%(15/75) in the control group] up to 5 yr. The effect of the two different eHFs was similar. Exclusively breastfed infants were significantly less exposed to tobacco smoke and pets, had solid foods introduced later and belonged to higher social classes. pHF was significantly (p = 0.05) less effective than eHF as regards prevention of development of CMA. A diet period of 4 months seems to be as efficient as 6 months or more as regards development of CMA. A few ongoing prospective, randomized intervention studies have produced the first indication that avoidance of indoor allergens such as house dust mite (HDM) in HR infants may reduce the incidence of severe wheeze and sensitization during the first 1-4 yr of age."

The beneficial action of physical activity is connected with direct effect on organism, which leads to adaptive changes increasing the efficiency of its functioning.","On account of the frequency of appearing and character of atherosclerosis cardiac vascular disease, one of the most crucial elements of effective fight against it is preparation of complex preventive programs including as vast number of population as possible. Consequently, Benjamin and Smitch suggested attaching the notion of basic prevention to the standard division into primary and secondary one. The basic prevention, carrying out in the general population, should concern genetic predisposition, psychosocial factors, keeping up proper body weight, healthy eating and physical activity. Especially high hopes are connected with high efficiency, simplicity and low money-consumption of preventive activities associated with physical activity modification, which has a crucial influence on reducing negative impact of atherosclerosis hazard. The results of numerous scientific research, carried out in many countries and on various, large groups, proved undoubtedly that at the healthy adult people of both sex the systematic physical activity of moderate intensification plays an essential part in preventing CVD and decreasing the death risk because of that reason as well. Moreover, systematic physical exercises show many other health-oriented actions, thanks to which they have an influence on decreasing premature and total death rate. The risk of incidence of civilization-related diseases such as diabetes type II, hypertension, obesity, osteoporosis, tumors (of large intestine, breast, prostatic gland) and depression has decreased significantly. Unequivocally positive influence has been proved at many observations dedicated to health recreational physical activity and physical activity connected with professional work based on aerobe effort. The positive effects have been also observed at children population and senior population which is more and more numerous and the most at risk. The beneficial action of physical activity is connected with direct effect on organism, which leads to adaptive changes increasing the efficiency of its functioning and, in intermediate way, modifying and reducing the influence of other risk factors of cardiac vascular disease, mainly obesity dyslipidemy and hypertension. The subsequent scientific observations had an influence on the alterations of scientific associations recommendations concerning the preferred kind, intensity and effective dose of health-oriented physical activity. The current recommendations on preventive usefulness of physical activity, implemented by Polish Cardiological Association, have been based on a document containing the guidelines of European Cardiologic Association coming from 2003. All described evidences present in unambiguous way the undeniable benefits of active lifestyle. Its promoting as well as supporting in this area vast number of population, especially in case of disturbing epidemiological data, is becoming a duty of not only health service workers but also state administration employees responsible for planning public health expenditure."
Unhealthy food advertising.

In order to develop and support recommendations, an analysis of the available evidence on the impact of food advertising on the health of children and adolescents has been carried out. Literature review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses published up to January 2022 for the term ""food advertising"" that analyzed the impact of food advertising on weight, body mass index (BMI), adiposity, dietary intake, behavior toward the advertised product, its purchase or consumption in children and adolescents. Twenty-one systematic reviews fulfilled the inclusion criteria, including a total of 490 primary studies, 5 of which also contained a meta-analysis. The vast majority of the primary studies evaluate intermediate effects, related to the behavior of children and adolescents in relation to advertised products and their consumption. There is great variety in terms of the type of advertising and effects studied. Most of the studies agree that there is an association between food advertising and effect analyzed, being more evident in children under 12 years of age and in obese children. Most recent systematic reviews are focused on online advertising, noticing the negative effects especially in adolescents. Children and adolescents are a particularly vulnerable population to food advertising strategies. Despite the difficulty to demonstrate an independent effect, there is evidence of an association between food advertising and childhood and adolescents' behavior respect to the announced products, and the increase of consumption at short-term. In Spain unhealthy product advertising are still very common in the media and in the children and adolescent's online environment. The Nutrition and Breastfeeding Committee of the Spanish Association of Pediatrics supports the need for regulation and limitation of unhealthy food advertising, covering all media and marketing strategies."
Multivitamin-multimineral supplements: who uses them?,Rock,"Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17209209/,"Multivitamin formulations with or without minerals are typically the most common type of dietary supplement reported.

Multivitamin formulations with or without minerals are typically the most common type of dietary supplement reported in surveys and studies that collect data relating to dietary supplement use. In the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2000, 52% of adults reported taking a dietary supplement in the past month, and 35% reported regular use of a multivitamin-multimineral (MVMM) product. NHANES III data indicate an overall prevalence of dietary supplement usage of 40%, with prevalence rates of 35% in NHANES II and 23% in NHANES I. Women (versus men), older age groups, non-Hispanic whites (versus non-Hispanic blacks or Mexican Americans), and those with a higher education level, lower body mass index, higher physical activity level, and more frequent consumption of wine had a greater likelihood of reporting use of MVMM supplements in NHANES 1999-2000. Data from children suggest a similar prevalence rate, but lower prevalence rates of usage were reported in studies of adolescents. Individuals who use dietary supplements (including MVMM formulations) generally report higher dietary nutrient intakes and healthier diets in studies in which dietary data were also collected. Among adults with a history of breast or prostate cancer, usage rates for dietary supplements in general and MVMMs are considerably higher (eg, 56-57% for MVMMs), and these subgroups are more likely to also report use of single vitamin and mineral supplements. Thus, MVMM use contributes a considerable proportion of nutrient intakes in the United States and may contribute to risk of excessive intakes."
"Weight, dietary behavior, and physical activity in childhood and adolescence: implications for adult cancer risk.","Fuemmeler, Pendzich, Tercyak","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20054223/,"Lifestyle factors related to energy balance, including weight, dietary behavior and physical activity, are associated with cancer risk.

The period of childhood and growth into adolescence and early adulthood may re-present a 'cumulative risk' for later adult-onset cancers. We review a number of epidemiologic studies that have examined associations among childhood and adolescent body size, diet, and physical activity with adult cancer risk. These studies suggest that unhealthy behaviors that develop early in life and persist over time may increase the risk of some cancer types, such as premenopausal breast, ovarian, endometrial, colon and renal cancer, adversely affect cancer-related morbidities, and increase mortality. Continued research is needed to further determine and refine how timing and degree of such exposures in early childhood and adolescence relate to adult cancer risk. Presently, sufficient evidence suggests a continued need for stronger primary prevention in cancer and obesity research via modified lifestyle behaviors earlier in the developmental spectrum, i.e. during childhood and adolescence."

Changes over time are also evident and recently there has been a clear shift to increasing breast cancer particularly in well-educated women, who conversely are at much lower risk of cervical cancer. With infection-related and tobacco-related cancers, programs of prevention and early detection will yield desirable results only if it is associated with a program directed towards elimination of poverty, illiteracy and restoring social inequality. Similarly education must play a role in combatting diet-related neoplasia but here the target population may differ, requiring a specific awareness of psychological profiles."

Guidelines for treatment are available, but their implementation is suboptimal. Then developed countries are slowing learning integrating the development of suitable guidelines with implementation plans. Awareness, psychosocial and family factors strongly influence asthma and food allergy control. Moreover, monitoring tools are necessary to facilitate self-management. By taking into consideration these and many other pragmatic aspects, national public health programs to control the allergic epidemic have been successful in reducing its impact and trace the need for future research in the area."

The Guide to Community Preventive Services previously conducted systematic reviews on the effectiveness of 11 interventions to increase screening for these cancers. This article presents results of updated systematic reviews for nine of these interventions. Five databases were searched for studies published during January 2004-October 2008. Studies had to (1) be a primary investigation of one or more intervention category; (2) be conducted in a country with a high-income economy; (3) provide information on at least one cancer screening outcome of interest; and (4) include screening use prior to intervention implementation or a concurrent group unexposed to the intervention category of interest. Forty-five studies were included in the reviews. Recommendations were added for one-on-one education to increase screening with fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) and group education to increase mammography screening. Strength of evidence for client reminder interventions to increase FOBT screening was upgraded from sufficient to strong. Previous findings and recommendations for reducing out-of-pocket costs (breast cancer screening); provider assessment and feedback (breast, cervical, and FOBT screening); one-on-one education and client reminders (breast and cervical cancer screening); and reducing structural barriers (breast cancer and FOBT screening) were reaffirmed or unchanged. Evidence remains insufficient to determine effectiveness for the remaining screening tests and intervention categories. Findings indicate new and reaffirmed interventions effective in promoting recommended cancer screening, including colorectal cancer screening. Findings can be used in community and healthcare settings to promote recommended care. Important research gaps also are described."

Despite the high probability of survival, and often good quality of life in female survivors, until recently the concept of fertility preservation has not been seen to be an important component of the overall management of these patients. Over the last few years, various protection and preservation strategies have been developed, which may address potential reproductive concerns. Gametes or embryos may be frozen prior to potentially gonadotoxic cancer therapy, and ovarian tissue may be frozen and stored, with several pregnancies described after subsequent grafting. There is also increasing interest in the possibility of ovarian protection using gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues during chemotherapy, despite the lack of randomised controlled trials. Additionally, there are reports of novel protective strategies, including therapeutic alteration or manipulation of the sphingomyelin pathways. This review summarises methods of fertility protection and preservation currently available, as well as the emergence of promising new strategies."

Data from animal experiments and from epidemiological and endocrinological studies in humans support the hypothesis that the individual hormones which control normal growth of target organs can also create the proper conditions for neoplastic transformation. The concept that hormones can cause, i.e., increase the incidence of, human cancer is most developed for the four hormone-related cancers which are numerically the most important, namely, breast, prostate, endometrium, and ovary. Even for these sites, large gaps remain in our knowledge of the responsible hormones and the conditions which create the optimal opportunity for carcinogenesis. Although scanty, the available epidemiological evidence also suggests a hormonal role in the pathogenesis of testis cancer, thyroid cancer, and osteosarcoma. We believe that the primary prevention of all these cancers will probably depend on modification of the factors which affect the secretion and metabolism of the responsible hormones rather than on control of exposure to classical exogenous initiators."
Detection of SARS-CoV-2-Specific Antibodies in Human Breast Milk and Their Neutralizing Capacity after COVID-19 Vaccination: A Systematic Review.,"Nicolaidou, Georgiou, Christofidou, Felekkis, Pieri, Papaneophytou","Systematic Review, Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36769279/,"SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes the infectious disease Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Until today, none of the authorized vaccines have been approved for use in individuals under six months. antibodies contained in mothers' breastmilk are a critical protective mechanism.","SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes the infectious disease known as Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The severe impact of the virus on humans is undeniable, which is why effective vaccines were highly anticipated. As of 12 January 2022, nine vaccines have obtained Emergency Use Listing by the World Health Organization (WHO), and four of these are approved or authorized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States. The initial clinical trials studying COVID-19 vaccine efficacy excluded pregnant and lactating individuals, meaning that data on the effects of the vaccine on breast milk were lacking. Until today, none of the authorized vaccines have been approved for use in individuals under six months. During the first months of life, babies do not produce their own antibodies; therefore, antibodies contained in their mothers' breastmilk are a critical protective mechanism. Several studies have shown the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the breast milk of women who have been vaccinated or had been naturally infected. However, whether these are protective is still unclear. Additionally, research on the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and the mRNA-1273 vaccine developed by Moderna suggests that these vaccines do not release significant amounts, if any, of mRNA into breast milk. Hence, there is no evidence that vaccination of the mother poses any risk to the breastfed infant, while the antibodies present in breast milk may offer protection against the virus. The primary objective of this systematic review is to summarize the current understanding of the presence of immunoglobulins in human milk that are elicited by SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and to evaluate their ability to neutralize the virus. Additionally, we aim to quantify the side effects experienced by lactating mothers who have been vaccinated, as well as the potential for adverse effects in their infants. This study is critical because it can help inform decision-making by examining the current understanding of antibody secretion in breastmilk. This is particularly important because, although the virus tends to be less severe in younger individuals, infants who contract the disease are at a higher risk of requiring hospitalization compared to older children."

We developed a web-based system, ALCHEMIST, that uses decision models and automatically creates evidence-based guidelines that can be disseminated, tailored and updated over the web. Our objective was to demonstrate the use of this system with clinical scenarios that provide challenges for guideline development. We used the ALCHEMIST system to develop guidelines for three clinical scenarios: (1) Chlamydia screening for adolescent women, (2) antiarrhythmic therapy for the prevention of sudden cardiac death; and (3) genetic testing for the BRCA breast-cancer mutation. ALCHEMIST uses information extracted directly from the decision model, combined with the additional information from the author of the decision model, to generate global guidelines. ALCHEMIST generated electronic web-based guidelines for each of the three scenarios. Using ALCHEMIST, we demonstrate that tailoring a guideline for a population at high-risk for Chlamydia changes the recommended policy for control of Chlamydia from contact tracing of reported cases to a population-based screening programme. We used ALCHEMIST to incorporate new evidence about the effectiveness of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) and demonstrate that the cost-effectiveness of use of ICDs improves from $74 400 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained to $34 500 per QALY gained. Finally, we demonstrate how a clinician could use ALCHEMIST to incorporate a woman's utilities for relevant health states and thereby develop patient-specific recommendations for BRCA testing; the patient-specific recommendation improved quality-adjusted life expectancy by 37 days. The ALCHEMIST system enables guideline developers to publish both a guideline and an interactive decision model on the web. This web-based tool enables guideline developers to tailor guidelines systematically, to update guidelines easily, and to make the underlying evidence and analysis transparent for users."
Epidemiology of cancer in the United States.,Cresanta,"Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1410056/,"Malignant neoplasms are responsible for more than half a million deaths annually and 22.5% of all deaths in the United States.

A suitable screening test should be rapid, simple and inexpensive.","Malignant neoplasms are responsible for more than half a million deaths annually and 22.5% of all deaths in the United States. Cancer is the second leading cause of death overall and the leading cause of death among Americans aged 35-64. Within the next decade it may become the leading cause of death. Cancers of digestive and respiratory organs are responsible for 53% of all cancer deaths. Certain subgroups are at elevated risk for various cancers. For example, sun-sensitive or excessively sun-exposed young white adults, young black women, and elderly patients are at increased risk for cutaneous melanoma, breast cancer, and colon cancer, respectively. Black men have the greatest risk for both lung cancer and cancer of the prostate. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia and solid tumors of the brain and nervous system are the most frequent forms of malignancy occurring among children less than or equal to 14 years. Office screening is the traditional method for identifying cancer victims as early as possible. A suitable screening test should be rapid, simple, inexpensive, and impose minimal discomfort. There must be a window of opportunity available to identify the cancer during a detectable preclinical phase, and therapeutic modalities must be available to alter progression. An office screening test for cancer may have any one of four outcomes, and three of them are bad. False negatives are the worst adverse outcome because cancer remains undetected despite screening. An epidemic of lung cancer, caused by cigarette smoking, is occurring in all race and sex groups. If Americans stopped smoking, 87% of lung cancer deaths could be prevented. Tobacco abuse also is a major risk factor for cancer of the esophagus, larynx, and oral cavity. Cigarette smoking is a contributing factor for cancer of the bladder, kidney, and pancreas, and it has been associated with both cervical cancer and cancer of the stomach. Smoking and smokeless tobacco cessation endorsements, messages, and programs must be part of routine disease prevention and health promotion activities in every primary care practice. More than 1 million Americans became new cancer victims last year, and more than 1 million additional cases will be detected this year. Because of the striking variability in state and regional patterns of various forms of cancer, geographic location of a practice may influence the frequency of cancers seen. Four sites (breast, prostate, lung, colon, and rectum) were responsible for 55% of cancer mortality and 56% of all new cases of cancer detected during 1991.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Medline, Embase and CINAHL databases were searched for cohort studies and case control studies that compared exclusive breast-feeding rates with formula or mixed (breast and formula) of the same duration. Three case control studies met the review criteria and were included in the review. The results from these studies show that there is a reduced risk in the onset of CD in those children who were exclusively breast-fed compared to those who were not. However, the design of these studies did not allow a causal relationship to be established. The evidence from these studies suggests a delay in the onset of CD in breast-fed children, however it cannot be ruled out that breast-feeding continues to have a protective factor in adolescence and adulthood. The exact role of breast-feeding in CD prevention needs to be clarified: is it a protective factor against CD, or does it delay the appearance of clinical symptoms? Parents should continue to be encouraged and supported with breast-feeding, as it is the best form of infant nutrition and protective against short and long-term health outcomes."

ATCS can supplement or replace telephone contact between health professionals and patients. There are four different types of ATCS: unidirectional (one-way, non-interactive voice communication), interactive voice response (IVR) systems, ATCS with additional functions such as access to an expert to request advice (ATCS Plus) and multimodal ATCS, where the calls are delivered as part of a multicomponent intervention. To assess the effects of ATCS for preventing disease and managing long-term conditions on behavioural change, clinical, process, cognitive, patient-centred and adverse outcomes. We searched 10 electronic databases (the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; Embase; PsycINFO; CINAHL; Global Health; WHOLIS; LILACS; Web of Science; and ASSIA); three grey literature sources (Dissertation Abstracts, Index to Theses, Australasian Digital Theses); and two trial registries (www.controlled-trials.com; www.clinicaltrials.gov) for papers published between 1980 and June 2015.

Studies in all settings, for all consumers/carers, in any preventive healthcare or long term condition management role were eligible. We used standard Cochrane methods to select and extract data and to appraise eligible studies. We included 132 trials (N = 4,669,689). Studies spanned across several clinical areas, assessing many comparisons based on evaluation of different ATCS types and variable comparison groups. Forty-one studies evaluated ATCS for delivering preventive healthcare, 84 for managing long-term conditions, and seven studies for appointment reminders. We downgraded our certainty in the evidence primarily because of the risk of bias for many outcomes. We judged the risk of bias arising from allocation processes to be low for just over half the studies and unclear for the remainder. We considered most studies to be at unclear risk of performance or detection bias due to blinding, while only 16% of studies were at low risk. We generally judged the risk of bias due to missing data and selective outcome reporting to be unclear.For preventive healthcare, ATCS (ATCS Plus, IVR, unidirectional) probably increase immunisation uptake in children (risk ratio (RR) 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18 to 1.32; 5 studies, N = 10,454; moderate certainty) and to a lesser extent in adolescents (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.11; 2 studies, N = 5725; moderate certainty). The effects of ATCS in adults are unclear (RR 2.18, 95% CI 0.53 to 9.02; 2 studies, N = 1743; very low certainty).For screening, multimodal ATCS increase uptake of screening for breast cancer (RR 2.17, 95% CI 1.55 to 3.04; 2 studies, N = 462; high certainty) and colorectal cancer (CRC) (RR 2.19, 95% CI 1.88 to 2.55; 3 studies, N = 1013; high certainty) versus usual care. It may also increase osteoporosis screening. ATCS Plus interventions probably slightly increase cervical cancer screening (moderate certainty), but effects on osteoporosis screening are uncertain. IVR systems probably increase CRC screening at 6 months (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.48; 2 studies, N ="

We reviewed retrospectively our experience in patients undergoing cardiac operations by means of redo submammary incisions. Fifteen consecutive female patients with a mean age of 13.2 years (range, 0.7 to 44 years) underwent reoperation through a former submammary incision. Seventy-three percent (11 of 15) had median sternotomy, cardiopulmonary bypass, and cardiac repairs. The mean aortic cross-clamp and cardiopulmonary bypass times were 78 +/- 49.7 minutes (range, 16 to 182 minutes) and 114.4 +/- 66.4 minutes (range, 27 to 261 minutes), respectively. Twenty-seven percent (4 of 15) had off-pump procedures; 3 for pacemaker-related issues (1 a third time reentry) and 1 for removal of sternal wires. Mean time interval between the primary submammary incision and reoperation was 5.4 +/- 5.6 years (range, 0.01 to 20 years). Mean first 24 hours Hemovac drainage was 3.2 +/- 2.4 mL/kg (range, 0.4 to 8.5 mL/kg). Mean intensive care unit and hospital stays were 2.1 +/- 1.7 days (range, 0.0 to 5 days) and 5.5 +/- 3.6 days (range, 0.80 to 13 days), respectively. One patient exhibited a chylothorax requiring ligation of her thoracic duct. Another patient had an infected seroma requiring incision and drainage 2 months postoperatively. Skin necrosis and infection were absent in this group. Breast development and lactation were normal. The cosmetic results were satisfactory. There was no mortality. Redo sternotomies performed through redo transverse submammary incisions are safe for cardiac repair and result in acceptable cosmetic and functional results."

More recent research suggests effects may extend to other areas, including reports that cigarette smoking decreases breast milk production in mothers, byproducts of tobacco use are transmitted in breast milk, exposure to passive smoking may alter children's intelligence and behavior, and passive smoke exposure in childhood may be a risk factor for developing lung cancer as an adult. Primary prevention is the most effective strategy to decrease the prevalence of smoking. Those who never smoke never become addicted to nicotine and never have to quit. Secondary prevention must also be emphasized, because children whose parents smoke are exposed to health risks and are themselves more likely to smoke in the future. Parental health can be improved by smoking cessation. To accomplish the goals of primary and secondary prevention, the aggressive public health strategy directed at both parents and children should be expanded. This strategy requires the strong support of physicians, with emphasis on prevention in practice, support of public health initiatives, medical and public policy, and the conduct of high-quality research."

Reproductive factors such as early menarche, late age at first full term birth, nulliparity, and late age at menopause increase risk of breast cancer, but manipulation of any one of these factors does not seem to be a realistic preventive tool. Nevertheless, the future possibility of using tamoxifen as a chemopreventive agent against breast cancer is discussed, particularly in relation to women at increased risk due to familial clustering. Alcohol consumption by young women, and overweight among postmenopausal women may also increase the incidence of breast cancer. Consequently, reduced alcohol intake by young women, and weight reduction among overweight women after menopause may reduce the risk of breast cancer."

GnRH-analogues and oral contraceptives for fertility preservation in women during chemotherapy.,"Blumenfeld, von Wolff","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18824495/,"Non-invasive techniques have attempted to minimize the gonadotoxic effect of chemotherapy. GnRH-a and oral contraceptives have no serious side effects and can even reduce chemotherapy-induced complications, such as severe menometrorrhagia.","For preserving fertility in women during chemotherapy, the character of invasive techniques, such as ovarian cryopreservation and other techniques, await further experience. Meanwhile, non-invasive techniques have attempted to minimize the gonadotoxic effect of chemotherapy, by using gonadotrophin-releasing hormone-analogues (GnRH-a) or oral contraceptives (OC). We performed a computerized MEDLINE search to identify articles published on fertility preservation using GnRH-a or OCs. Nine human-controlled studies reported the use of GnRH-a and four reported the use of OCs in parallel to chemotherapy. All nine studies analysing the effect of GnRH-a found lower rates of premature ovarian failure (POF) in patients receiving GnRH-a compared with the controls. Summarizing the studies resulted in 11.1% incidence of POF in patients who received GnRH-a compared with 55.5% incidence in the controls. Evidence using the fertility preserving effect of OC is limited. Two studies showed lower POF rates in OC-treated patients. The summarized data revealed a POF rate of 13.2% in patients who received OCs compared with that of 29.8% in the controls. The published clinical studies provide evidence, but do not prove statistically, that GnRH-a co-treatment reduces gonadotoxicity. Owing to the retrospective and non-randomized nature of most of the studies, definite conclusions concerning the reduction of POF by GnRH-a can still not be unequivocally drawn. As GnRH-a and OC have no serious side effects and as GnRH-a can even reduce chemotherapy-induced complications, such as severe menometrorrhagia, GnRH-a are considered by many clinicians as a clinically useful co-treatment in chemotherapy. The published clinical studies on OC also suggest a possible effect on the reduction of POF under certain conditions."

The epidemiology of ovarian cancer.,"Greene, Clark, Blayney","Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6091274/,"No unequivocally effective ovarian cancer prevention strategies have emerged. Pregnancy, especially pregnancy before age 25 years, and use of oral contraceptives are protective. Survivors of ovarian cancer are more susceptible to cancers of the breast, endometrium, and colon than are similarly-aged normal women.","Although no unequivocally effective ovarian cancer prevention strategies have emerged, epidemiologic studies have identified high-risk populations. The striking international variation (apparently a fivefold difference) can probably be explained on the basis of differential parity, differing classification measures, and differences in the underlying population age distribution. United States age-adjusted mortality has increased slightly in the past 30 years, and the cancer remains predominantly a disease of older adult white women of northern European extraction. The increases in age-specific mortality and age-adjusted mortality over time may be related to a decrease in average family size. Pregnancy, especially pregnancy before age 25 years, and use of oral contraceptives are protective; the risk of ovarian cancer increases with increasing years of ovulation. A positive family history is also associated with a substantial increase in ovarian cancer risk. Survivors of ovarian cancer are more susceptible to cancers of the breast, endometrium, and colon than are similarly-aged normal women, most probably because all four cancers share some common risk factor(s). Various alkylating agents are clearly leukemogenic in survivors of ovarian cancer, an observation that suggests caution in the use of adjuvant chemotherapy in women at relatively low risk of relapse."

The aim of this study is to update the mortality and hospitalization analyses concerning the 6,227,531 inhabitants (10.4% of the Italian population) residing in 46 contaminated sites (39 of national interest and 7 of regional interest). The sites include 316 municipalities distributed as follows: 15 in the North-East (20.3% of the investigated population); 104 in the North-West (12% of the investigated population), 32 in the Centre (12.6% of the investigated population), 165 in the South and Islands (55.5% of the investigated population). Analyses were carried out on the paediatric-adolescent (1,128,396 residents) and youth (665,284 residents) population, and a study on congenital anomalies (CA) was carried out at sites covered by congenital malformation registers. Accompanying the epidemiological assessments, site-specific socioeconomic conditions were examined and an overall estimate of excess risk for populations residing at contaminated sites was drawn up. By means of a systematic review of the scientific literature, the epidemiological evidence on causal links between sources of environmental exposure and health effects was updated to identify pathologies of a priori interest. In the 46 sites included in the SENTIERI Project, mortality (time window: 2013-2017) and hospital admissions (time window: 2014-2018) of the general population of all ages, divided by gender, and of the paediatric-adolescent (0-1 year, 0-14 years, 0-19 years), youth (20-29 years), and overall (0-29 years) age groups, divided by gender, were analysed. In 21 sites, CA diagnosed within the first year of life were studied. Standardised mortality ratios (SMR) and hospitalization ratios (SHR) were calculated with reference to the rates in the regions to which the sites belong. The reference population was calculated net of residents in the sites. CA were studied by calculating the prevalence per 10,000 births and the ratio, multiplied by 100, between the cases observed at the site and those expected on the basis of the prevalences observed in the reference area (region or sub-regional area of belonging, according to the geographical coverage of the registry). The socioeconomic condition studied in the 46 sites is based on the convergence of three deprivation indicators with respect to the reference region: deprivation index at municipal level, deprivation index at census section level, premature mortality indicator (age range 30-69 years) for chronic non-communicable diseases. For the estimation of excess risk for the entire study population, meta-analysis of the mortality and hospitalization risk estimates for each site was carried out and the number of excess deaths estimated for the sites as a whole. The epidemiological evidence was updated through a systematic literature review (January 2009-May 2020), following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. The search was carried out on the search engines MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science; the quality of the studies included in the review was assessed using the AMSTAR 2 checklist for systematic reviews and the NewCastle-Ottawa"
