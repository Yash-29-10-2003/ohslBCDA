"Breast Cancer: Risk Assessment, Screening, and Primary Prevention.","Michaels, Worthington, Rusiecki","Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36759097/,"This review provides an outline of a risk-based approach to breast cancer screening and prevention. All women should be assessed for breast cancer risk starting at age 18. Patients can then be stratified into average, moderate, and high-risk groups. Counseling on breast awareness and lifestyle changes is recommended for all women.","This review provides an outline of a risk-based approach to breast cancer screening and prevention. All women should be assessed for breast cancer risk starting at age 18 with identification of modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors. Patients can then be stratified into average, moderate, and high-risk groups with personalized screening and prevention plans. Counseling on breast awareness and lifestyle changes is recommended for all women, regardless of risk category. High-risk individuals may benefit from additional screening modalities such as MRI and chemoprevention and should be managed closely by a multidisciplinary team."
Breastfeeding and Reduced Risk of Breast Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Qiu, Zhong, Hu, Wu","Journal Article, Meta-Analysis, Systematic Review, Retracted Publication",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35126640/,"meta-analysis was carried out on the basis of published literature from clinical trials and studies among different parts of the world. Menarche age, family history, lactation duration, and menopausal status have a strong effect on the risks of breast cancer.","Evidences which prove relation between breastfeeding women and risk of breast cancer have been limited. A meta-analysis was carried out on the basis of published literature from clinical trials and studies among different parts of the world. Studies were analyzed and extracted using PRISMA flowchart. RevMan 5.4.1 was used for analyzing the extracted data. Included studies were fully cited texts with complete information about studies, trails conducted for risk of breast cancer, and breastfeeding correlations. Menarche age, family history, lactation duration, and menopausal status have a strong effect on the risks of breast cancer. Family history studies concluded that for 95% CI, the risk ratio was 2.66 (2.00, 3.52). Findings have suggested that family history and lactation duration affect the risks of breast cancer."
Impact of Soy Foods on the Development of Breast Cancer and the Prognosis of Breast Cancer Patients.,Messina,"Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27161216/,The relationship between soy food intake and breast cancer has been rigorously investigated for more than 25 years. Observational studies show that among Asian women higher soy consumption is associated with an approximate 30% reduction in risk of developing breast cancer.,"The relationship between soy food intake and breast cancer has been rigorously investigated for more than 25 years. The identification of isoflavones as possible chemopreventive agents helped fuel this line of investigation. These diphenolic compounds, which are found in uniquely-rich amounts in soy beans, possess both estrogen-dependent and -independent properties that potentially inhibit the development of breast cancer. Observational studies show that among Asian women higher soy consumption is associated with an approximate 30% reduction in risk of developing breast cancer. However, evidence suggests that for soy to reduce breast cancer risk consumption must occur early in life, that is during childhood and/or adolescence. Despite the interest in the role of soy in reducing breast cancer risk concerns have arisen that soy foods, because they contain isoflavones, may increase the likelihood of high-risk women developing breast cancer and worsen the prognosis of breast cancer patients. However, extensive clinical and epidemiologic data show these concerns to be unfounded. Clinical trials consistently show that isoflavone intake does not adversely affect markers of breast cancer risk, including mammographic density and cell proliferation. Furthermore, prospective epidemiologic studies involving over 11,000 women from the USA and China show that postdiagnosis soy intake statistically significantly reduces recurrence and improves survival."
Effectiveness of educational intervention on breast cancer knowledge and breast self-examination among female university students in Bangladesh: a pre-post quasi-experimental study.,"Sarker, Islam, Moonajilin, Rahman, Gesesew, Ward","Clinical Trial, Journal Article",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35193526/,The aim of the study was to assess the effect of an educational intervention program on breast cancer knowledge and the practice of breast self-examination. A total of 400 female university students aged 18-26 years were included in the sample. Significant changes were found in knowledge and awareness about breast cancer.,"Breast cancer is a global health issue and a leading cause of death among women. Early detection through increased awareness and knowledge on breast cancer and breast cancer screening is thus crucial. The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of an educational intervention program on breast cancer knowledge and the practice of breast self-examination among young female students of a university in Bangladesh. A quasi-experimental (pre-post) study design was conducted at Jahangirnagar University in Bangladesh. Educational information on breast cancer and breast self-examination (BSE), demonstration of BSE procedure and leaflets were distributed among 400 female students after obtaining written informed consent. The stepwise procedures of BSE performance were demonstrated with images. Pre-intervention and 15 days post-intervention assessments were conducted to assess the changes in knowledge on breast cancer and practices of BSE. Mc-Nemar's tests and paired sampled t-tests were performed to investigate the differences between pre- and post-test stages. A total of 400 female university students aged 18-26 years were included in the sample. Significant changes were found in knowledge and awareness about breast cancer and BSE practices after the educational intervention. The significant differences were measured in the mean scores of pre-test vs. post-test: breast cancer symptoms (2.99 Â± 1.05 vs. 6.35 Â± 1.15; p < 0.001), risk factors (3.35 Â± 1.19 vs. 7.56 Â± 1.04; p < 0.001), treatment (1.79 Â± 0.90 vs. 4.63 Â± 0.84; p < 0.001), prevention (3.82 Â± 1.32 vs. 7.14 Â± 1.03; p < 0.001), screening of breast cancer (1.82 Â± 0.55 vs. 3.98 Â± 0.71; p < 0.001) and process of BSE (1.57 Â± 1.86 vs. 3.94 Â± 0.93; p < 0.001). Likewise, a significant percentage of change in BSE practices was obtained between pre-test and post-test (21.3% vs. 33.8%; p < 0.001). Study findings confirm that the study population had inadequate awareness and knowledge at baseline which was improved significantly after educational intervention. A nationwide roll-out with community-based interventions is recommended for the female population in both rural and urban areas."
RightCare: wrong answers.,Dropkin,Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29126274/,NHS RightCare is an NHS England programme describing itself as 'a proven approach that delivers better patient outcomes' It compares each Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) with the 'Best 5' of a fixed set of 'Similar 10' CCGs chosen using equally weighted demographic and deprivation indicators. This article tests whether these indicators are sufficient and equal weighting is appropriate.,"NHS RightCare is an NHS England programme describing itself as 'a proven approach that delivers better patient outcomes'. It identifies opportunities for savings and quality improvements, comparing each Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) with the 'Best 5' of a fixed set of 'Similar 10' CCGs chosen using equally weighted demographic and deprivation indicators. This article tests whether these indicators are sufficient and equal weighting is appropriate, and evaluates significance. Robust public data on lung, colorectal, and breast cancer mortality is modelled using the indicators and incidence. Peers chosen using the preferred models are compared with the Similar 10. Confidence intervals are obtained for comparator group averages. RightCare significance is simulated. Preferred models have unequally weighted covariates. Incidence is the strongest predictor of lung cancer mortality. The 'Similar 10' are inappropriate comparators. RightCare significance ignores variability of comparator outcomes, causing 12% Type I errors. Whilst RightCare shows 1842 annual avoidable lung cancer deaths in 80 CCGs, only 168 deaths in 8 CCGs appear exceptional using appropriate peers and CIs. CCGs cannot expect to match the average performance of the RightCare 'Best 5'. Until the methodology is examined with data of known quality, claims that RightCare is a 'proven approach' are unsubstantiated."
"Breast Cancer Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices amongst Women in Qatar.","Hamed, Alemrayat, Syed, Daher-Nashif, Rasheed, Kane",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35409678/,"Study examines knowledge, attitudes, and practices surrounding breast cancer awareness and screening among women residents in Qatar. Of the 9008 participants, 69% report awareness of breast cancer warning signs. Nearly half (45.4%) report rarely or never checking their breasts for abnormalities.","This cross-sectional study examines knowledge, attitudes, and practices surrounding breast cancer awareness and screening among women residents in Qatar. Females, >18 years old, registered with the Primary Health Care Corporation were invited to complete an Arabic or English online survey using a modified version of the Breast Cancer Awareness Module. Of the 9008 participants, 69% report awareness of breast cancer warning signs, but the results did not substantiate these claims. There remains a disconnect between participantsâ€™ perceived awareness of their ability to detect breast cancer and their actual recognition of individual signs and symptoms. Nearly half (45.4%) report rarely or never checking their breasts for abnormalities (44.6%). Breast self-examination (BSE) and Breast Cancer Screening (BCS) uptake is low and many are unaware of the starting age for invitation to Qatarâ€™s BCS program. While only 18% of women report receiving an invitation, 94% attended, indicating that the BCS invitation is a remarkably effective means of improving screening uptake. Policymakers should capitalize on early recognition, which is possible in the youthful population. Broadening awareness campaigns and interventions targeting a broader audience including males, community and religious leaders and healthcare professionals may prove more effective in Arab communities."
Breast cancer risk accumulation starts early: prevention must also.,"Colditz, Bohlke, Berkey","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24820413/,Nearly one in four breast cancers is diagnosed before the age of 50. Breast tissue undergoes rapid cellular proliferation between menarche and first full-term pregnancy. Risk accumulates rapidly until the terminal differentiation that accompanies first pregnancy.,"Nearly one in four breast cancers is diagnosed before the age of 50, and many early-stage premalignant lesions are present but not yet diagnosed. Therefore, we review evidence to support the strategy that breast cancer prevention efforts must begin early in life. This study follows the literature review methods and format. Exposures during childhood and adolescence affect a woman's long-term risk of breast cancer, but have received far less research attention than exposures that occur later in life. Breast tissue undergoes rapid cellular proliferation between menarche and first full-term pregnancy, and risk accumulates rapidly until the terminal differentiation that accompanies first pregnancy. Evidence on childhood diet and growth in height, and adolescent alcohol intake, among other adolescent factors is related to breast cancer risk and risk of premalignant proliferative benign lesions. Breast cancer prevention efforts will have the greatest effect when initiated at an early age and continued over a lifetime. Gaps in knowledge are identified and deserve increase attention to inform prevention."
"Management and Prevention of Breast Cancer After Radiation to the Chest for Childhood, Adolescent, and Young Adulthood Malignancy.","Koo, Henderson, Dwyer, Skandarajah",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25971959/,"Women treated with chest irradiation for childhood, adolescent, and young adulthood have an increased risk of developing second cancers of the breast (SCB) There are few uniform guidelines regarding surveillance and prevention for this high-risk group. Factors associated with increased SCB risk include young age at irradiation, prolong duration since irradiation and increased radiation dose and field.","Women treated with chest irradiation for childhood, adolescent, and young adulthood (CAYA) malignancies, in particular Hodgkin's lymphoma, have an increased risk of developing second cancers of the breast (SCB). However, there are few uniform guidelines regarding surveillance and prevention for this high-risk group. A systematic search using PUBMED and OVID MEDLINE was performed. Publications listed under the terms ""breast neoplasm"", ""neoplasm, radiation-induced"", ""therapeutic radiation-induced breast cancer"", ""screening"", ""surveillance"", ""prevention"", and ""prophylaxis"" between January 1992 and January 2015 were assessed. A total of 138 publications were reviewed. Factors associated with increased SCB risk include young age at irradiation, prolong duration since irradiation (peak relative risk 13.87 at 15-19 years postradiation), and increased radiation dose and field. Early menopause reduces SCB risk. Annual screening mammography and breast MRI is recommended from age 25 or 8 years posttreatment for women treated with â‰¥20 Gy chest radiation before age 30 years. Compared with sporadic primary breast cancers (PBC), SCB more often are bilateral (6-34 %), managed with mastectomy (56-100 %), hormone receptor-negative (27-49 %), and high-grade (35 %). Women with SCB have a similar breast cancer event-free survival and breast cancer-specific survival compared to women with PBC. However, their overall survival is worse due to comorbid conditions. There is paucity of information regarding secondary prevention of SCB. Survivors of CAYA malignancy are at risk of many late effects, including iatrogenic breast cancer from chest irradiation. They are best managed in a multidisciplinary late-effects setting where tailored risk management can be provided."
Executive Summary of the Early-Onset Breast Cancer Evidence Review Conference.,"Chelmow, Pearlman, Young, Bozzuto, Dayaratna, Jeudy, Kremer, Scott, O'Hara","Journal Article, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S., Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32459439/,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention launched the Bring Your Brave campaign to increase knowledge about early-onset breast cancer. This article summarizes the relevant literature, existing guidance, and validated tools to guide health care providers in the prevention, early detection, and special considerations.","The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention launched the Bring Your Brave campaign to increase knowledge about early-onset breast cancer, defined as breast cancer in women aged 18-45 years. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists convened a panel of experts in breast disease from the Society for Academic Specialists in General Obstetrics and Gynecology to review relevant literature, validated tools, best practices, and practice guidelines as a first step toward developing educational materials for women's health care providers about early-onset breast cancer. Panel members conducted structured literature reviews, which were then reviewed by other panel members and discussed at an in-person meeting of stakeholder professional and patient advocacy organizations in April 2019. This article summarizes the relevant literature, existing guidance, and validated tools to guide health care providers in the prevention, early detection, and special considerations of early-onset breast cancer. Substantive knowledge gaps were noted and summarized to provide guidance for future research."
Integration of breast cancer prevention and early detection into cancer palliative care model.,"Bonsu, Ncama","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30893313/,Breast cancer is common among Ghanaian women. Late stage presentation has been credited to knowledge deficit and lack of breast cancer prevention and early detection services for women. Study aimed to develop a model to facilitate the integration of breast Cancer prevention and. early detection into cancer palliative care.,"Breast cancer is common among Ghanaian women. Late stage presentation has been credited to knowledge deficit and lack of breast cancer prevention and early detection services for women. This study aimed to develop a model to facilitate the integration of breast cancer prevention and early detection into cancer palliative care. This study used synthesized concepts emerging from a single case study research. The case was a tertiary health care facility, embedded with sub-units of analysis. Mixed-method approach was used to collect data from 102 participants. The study examined the experiences and views of the participants on breast cancer and screening pathways in Ghana. Thematic analysis and descriptive statistics ware used to analyze the qualitative and quantitative data respectively. This was followed with a cross-case analysis across the sub-units of analysis. A theory development approach was further used towards the development of a model, following three steps: concept analysis, statement synthesis and theory synthesis. Six key concepts synthesized from the data were used to develop the model: initiate and sustain breast cancer prevention and early detection program, collaboration of health professionals, patients, families and micro-communities, conducive environment of the health care facility and needed resources, actions, services, and lastly diffusing innovation into the community through agents. A model has been developed based on the experiences shared by women diagnosed with advanced breast cancer, their first degree relatives, micro-communities as well as clinicians working in a palliative care setting. This model will aid clinicians to provide breast cancer education, teach breast self-examination and offer clinical breast examination to families and micro-communities of advanced breast cancer patients receiving supportive care in a resource-limited setting."
Association between diet during preadolescence and adolescence and risk for breast cancer during adulthood.,Mahabir,"Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23298994/,"Only a few epidemiologic studies have been conducted on the relationship between diet during preadolescence and adolescence, and cancer during adulthood. Research on preadolescent and adolescent diet is a paradigm shift in breast cancer investigations. This research paradigm has the potential to produce transformative knowledge.","It is increasingly evident that diet during preadolescence and adolescence has important consequences for breast cancer during adulthood. However, only a few epidemiologic studies have been conducted on the relationship between diet during preadolescence and adolescence, and cancer during adulthood. This situation is partly because of methodological challenges such as the long latency period, the complexity of breast cancer, the lack of validated diet assessment tools, and the large number of subjects that must be followed, all of which increase costs. In addition, funding opportunities are few for such studies. Results from the small number of epidemiologic studies are inconsistent, but evidence is emerging that specific aspects of the diet during preadolescence and adolescence are important. For example, during preadolescence and adolescence, severe calorie restriction with poor food quality, high total fat intake, and alcohol intake tend to increase risk, whereas high soy intake decreases risk. Research on preadolescent and adolescent diet is a paradigm shift in breast cancer investigations. This research paradigm has the potential to produce transformative knowledge to inform breast cancer prevention strategies through dietary intervention during preadolescence and adolescence, rather than later in life, as is current practice, when it is perhaps less effective. Methodological challenges that have plagued the field might now be overcome by leveraging several existing large-scale cohort studies in the U.S. and around the world to investigate the role of diet during preadolescence and adolescence in risk for adult breast cancer."
Breast Cancer.,Miller,Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7237367/,Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer of women in North America. Evidence is being obtained to support the role of dietary risk factors. Overweight as a risk factor in postmenopausal women also points to the importance of dietary factors.,"The pre-eminence of breast cancer as a significant cause of premature mortality and as the most prevalent cancer of women in North America justifies a major thrust in prevention. In the past, a number of hormonal risk factors were identified. Increasingly, evidence is being obtained to support the role of dietary risk factors and most particularly the total level of dietary fat. Overweight as a risk factor in postmenopausal women also points to the importance of dietary factors. It is concluded that the time is ripe for an active program of evaluating the effect of reduction in the consumption of total fat, particularly in adolescent, early adult and premenopausal women, and in reducing overweight in postmenopausal women, both as aspects of national policy and as special investigations in defined population groups."
"Physical activity and breast cancer risk: impact of timing, type and dose of activity and population subgroup effects.","Friedenreich, Cust","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18487249/,"A review of all published literature to September 2007 was conducted using online databases.

A review of all published literature to September 2007 was conducted using online databases; 34 case-control and 28 cohort studies were included. The impact of the different parameters of physical activity on the association between activity and the risk of breast cancer was examined by considering the type of activity performed, the timing of activity over the life course and the intensity of activity. Effect modification of this association by menopausal status, body mass index (BMI), racial group, family history of breast cancer, hormone receptor status, energy intake and parity were also considered. Evidence for a risk reduction associated with increased physical activity was found in 47 (76%) of 62 studies included in this review with an average risk decrease of 25-30%. A dose-response effect existed in 28 of 33 studies. Stronger decreases in risk were observed for recreational activity, lifetime or later life activity, vigorous activity, among postmenopausal women, women with normal BMI, non-white racial groups, those with hormone receptor negative tumours, women without a family history of breast cancer and parous women. The effect of physical activity on the risk of breast cancer is stronger in specific population subgroups and for certain parameters of activity that need to be further explored in future intervention trials."

Independent reviewers screened articles at the title/abstract and full-text levels, resolving differences by consensus with lead authors. The NIH Quality Assessment Tools were used to assess sources of bias. A total of 1,957 unique articles were identified; 5 met inclusion criteria. Samples size ranged from 68 to 1,185. All studies relied on self-reported adolescent and young adult physical activity. One study measured sports involvement; the others measured recreational activity. One large study was null, whereas 4 others showed a reduction in breast cancer incidence later in life with higher adolescent and young adult physical activity (pâ‰¤0.05). However, the protection was limited to premenopausal breast cancer in 1 of the studies (OR=0.62; 95% CI=0.40, 0.96; p-trend=0.01). In addition, adolescent and young adult physical activity was associated with older age at breast cancer diagnosis in 1 study (p=0.03). A limited number of studies suggest that adolescent and young adult physical activity may reduce or delay the risk of breast cancer incidence among carriers of deleterious mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes."

Despite higher BCFH+ girls' greater perceived breast cancer risk, there were no differences between BCFH+ and BCFH- girls on diet, exercise, alcohol initiation, or BSE. BCFH+ girls were slightly more likely to report trying cigarettes (11% vs. 5%, p = .04). In multivariable models with all girls, categorical associations with behaviors included the following: developmental and demographic factors with smoking, alcohol, diet, and exercise; family breast cancer history and experience with smoking, alcohol, and diet; psychosocial factors with smoking; girls perceptions of cancer controllability and mother support for health behaviors with alcohol, diet, exercise, and BSE; and mother behaviors with diet. Adolescent girls from BCFH+ families reported similar health behaviors to BCFH- peers, signaling that they are not translating their higher perceived risk into cancer control behaviors. Both uncontrollable (i.e., breast cancer experiences) and modifiable factors relate to health behaviors and warrant further investigation. Results indicate that interventions with teens and parents that target modifiable variables such as controllability perceptions, maternal modeling, and communication may relate to better health behaviors and reduced future breast cancer risk."

Findings from this large prospective study support a role of ophorecism for the prevention of premenopausal breast cancer.,"Whether oophorectomy reduces breast cancer risk among BRCA mutation carriers is a matter of debate. We undertook a prospective analysis of bilateral oophorectomy and breast cancer risk in BRCA mutation carriers. Subjects had no history of cancer, had both breasts intact, and had information on oophorectomy status (n = 3722). Women were followed until breast cancer diagnosis, prophylactic bilateral mastectomy, or death. A Cox regression model was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of breast cancer associated with oophorectomy (coded as a time-dependent variable). All statistical tests were two-sided. Over a mean follow-up of 5.6 years, 350 new breast cancers were diagnosed. Among women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, oophorectomy was not associated with breast cancer risk compared with women who did not undergo an oophorectomy. The age-adjusted hazard ratio associated with oophorectomy was 0.96 (95% CI = 0.73 to 1.26, P = 76) for BRCA1 and was 0.65 (95% CI = 0.37 to 1.16, P = 14) for BRCA2 mutation carriers. In stratified analyses, the effect of oophorectomy was statistically significant for breast cancer in BRCA2 mutation carriers diagnosed prior to age 50 years (age-adjusted HR = 0.18, 95% CI = 0.05 to 0.63, P = 007). Oophorectomy was not associated with risk of breast cancer prior to age 50 years among BRCA1 mutation carriers (age-adjusted HR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.55 to 1.13, P = 51). Findings from this large prospective study support a role of oophorectomy for the prevention of premenopausal breast cancer in BRCA2, but not BRCA1 mutation carriers. These findings warrant further evaluation."
Improving knowledge about breast cancer and breast self examination in female Nigerian adolescents using peer education: a pre-post interventional study.,"Sadoh, Osime, Nwaneri, Ogboghodo, Eregie, Oviawe",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34507568/,"Pre-post interventional study carried out in October -December 2016 on female students of four secondary schools in Benin City. Pre-peer training, using a pre-tested self-administered questionnaire, knowledge about BC and BSE was assessed.","Prevention of BC of which the cornerstone is creating awareness and early detection is important in adolescents and young women because of their worse outcomes. Early detection strategies such as mammography are currently beyond the reach of most women in sub-Saharan Africa.. Lack of awareness and late presentation contribute to the poor outcomes. Awareness creation among adolescents may result in modification of some risk factors for BC with adoption of healthy life styles including accessing early detection activities. This study determined the effect of peer education as a strategy to create awareness on BC and breast self examination (BSE) among in-school female adolescents in Benin City. This was a pre-post interventional study carried out in October -December 2016 on female students of four secondary schools in Benin City. Pre-peer training, using a pre-tested self-administered questionnaire, knowledge about BC and BSE was assessed in about 30% of each school population. This was followed by training of 124 students selected from the schools (one student per class) as peer trainers. The peer trainers provided training on BC and BSE (the intervention) for their classmates. Within two weeks of peer training knowledge about BC and BSE was reassessed in 30% of each school population. Selection of students for assessment pre and post intervention was by systematic sampling. Correct knowledge was scored and presented as percentages. Chi square test, student t test and ANOVA were used to assess associations and test differences with level of significance set at p < 0.05. There were 1337 and 1201 students who responded to the pre and post-training questionnaires respectively. The mean BC knowledge score (20.61 Â± 13.4) prior to training was low and it statistically significantly improved to 55.93 Â± 10.86 following training p < 0.0001 Following peer training, statistically significant improvement (p 0.037- < 0.001) occurred in most knowledge domains apart from symptomatology. Pre-peer training 906(67.8%) students knew about BSE but only 67(4.8%). Significantly more students 1134(94.7%) knew about BSE following peer training. Peer education strategy can be used to improve BC and BSE knowledge in adolescents. This strategy is low cost and could be very useful in low resource settings."
Breast cancer prevention: a review of current evidence.,Vogel,"Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10901739/,The National Cancer Institute has created a breast cancer risk assessment tool. Women who are candidates for a preventive course of tamoxifen must be counseled. Prophylactic mastectomy offers at least a 90% reduction in the risk of breast cancer.,"The National Cancer Institute has created a breast cancer risk assessment tool that quickly estimates a woman's individualized absolute risk of developing breast cancer. Understanding the magnitude of risk is important because recent data show that breast cancer incidence may be reduced. All women may improve their overall health and thus perhaps minimize breast cancer risk by maintaining a healthy weight, avoiding cigarettes, limiting alcohol consumption, getting regular exercise, and avoiding non-diagnostic ionizing radiation. Nevertheless, no lifestyle modifications have yet been proven to prevent or definitively lower the risk of breast cancer. In addition, women whose personal breast cancer risk is high may consider reducing risk by pharmacologic or surgical means. In such women, a five-year course of tamoxifen reduced the risk of invasive breast cancer by 49%; women with lobular carcinoma in situ or atypical hyperplasia experienced even greater risk reductions. Because of the potential for vascular and endometrial side effects, women who are candidates for a preventive course of tamoxifen must be counseled regarding its relative risks and benefits. Prophylactic mastectomy offers at least a 90% reduction in the risk of breast cancer, but the physical and psychological changes involved in such a procedure make it a difficult choice for many women. Breast cancer risk assessment and appropriate counseling are becoming standard components of breast cancer screening and overall health maintenance."
Breast Cancer Risk and Use of Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Agents After a Benign Breast Biopsy.,"Sherman, Vierkant, Kaggal, Hoskin, Frost, Denison, Visscher, Carter, Winham, Jensen, Radisky, Vachon, Degnim","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32718942/,Over one million women in the United States receive biopsy diagnoses of benign breast disease (BBD) each year. Studies in the general population suggest that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAID) lower breast cancer risk. associations among women with BBD are unknown.,"Over one million women in the United States receive biopsy diagnoses of benign breast disease (BBD) each year, which confer a 1.5-4.0-fold increase in breast cancer risk. Studies in the general population suggest that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAID) lower breast cancer risk; however, associations among women with BBD are unknown. We assessed whether NSAID use among women diagnosed with BBD is associated with lower breast cancer risk. Participants included 3,080 women (mean age = 50.3 Â± 13.5 years) in the Mayo BBD surgical biopsy cohort diagnosed between January 1, 1992 and December 31, 2001 who completed breast cancer risk factor questionnaires that assessed NSAID use, and whose biopsies underwent detailed pathology review, masked to outcome. Women were followed from date of BBD biopsy to breast cancer diagnosis (main outcome) or censoring (death, prophylactic mastectomy, reduction mammoplasty, lobular carcinoma <i>in situ</i> or last contact). Median follow-up time was 16.4 Â± 6.0 years. Incident breast cancer was diagnosed among 312 women over a median follow-up of 9.9 years. Regular non-aspirin NSAID use was associated with lower breast cancer risk [HR = 0.63; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.46-0.85; <i>P</i> = 0.002] with trends of lower risk (highest tertiles of use vs. nonuse) for greater number of years used [HR = 0.55; 95% CI = 0.31-0.97; <i>P</i> <sub>trend</sub> = 0.003), days used per month (HR = 0.51; 95% CI = 0.33-0.80; <i>P</i> <sub>trend</sub> = 0.001) and lifetime number of doses taken (HR = 0.53; 95% CI = 0.31-0.89; <i>P</i> <sub>trend</sub> = 0.003). We conclude that nonaspirin NSAID use is associated with statistically significant lower breast cancer risk after a BBD biopsy, including a dose-response effect, suggesting a potential role for NSAIDs in breast cancer prevention among patients with BBD."
Breastfeeding and the prevention of breast cancer: a retrospective review of clinical histories.,"GonzÃ¡lez-JimÃ©nez, GarcÃ­a, Aguilar, Padilla, Ãlvarez",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23937211/,Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in younger women in Western countries. A retrospective study of the clinical histories of patients diagnosed with breast cancer at the San Cecilio University Hospital in Granada (Spain),"To evaluate at what age parous and nonparous women were diagnosed with breast cancer. Factors taken into account for parous women were whether they had breastfed their children, and if so, the length of the lactation period. Other factors considered for both groups were obesity, family histories of cancer, smoking habits and alcohol consumption. Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in younger women in Western countries. Its growing incidence as well as the increasingly early age of diagnosis led us to carefully analyse its possible causes and the preventive measures to be taken. This is a particularly important goal in epidemiological research. A retrospective study of the clinical histories of patients diagnosed with breast cancer at the San Cecilio University Hospital in Granada (Spain). In this study, we analysed 504 medical records of female patients, 19-91 years of age, who had been diagnosed and treated for breast cancer from 2004-2009 at the San Cecilio University Hospital in Granada (Spain). Relevant data (age of diagnosis, period of lactation, family history of cancer, obesity, alcohol consumption and smoking habits) were collected from the clinical histories of each patient and analysed. A conditional inference tree was used to relate the age of diagnosis to smoking habits and the length of the lactation period. The conditional inference tree identified significant differences between the age of the patients at breast cancer diagnosis, smoking habits (p < 0Â·001) and lactation period if the subjects had breastfed their children for more than six months (p = 0Â·006), regardless of whether they had a family history of cancer. Our study concluded that breastfeeding for over six months not only provides children with numerous health benefits, but also protects mothers from breast cancer when the mothers are nonsmokers. Nurses play a crucial role in encouraging new mothers to breastfeed their children, and this helps to prevent breast cancer."
Physical activity in adolescence and young adulthood and breast cancer risk: a quantitative review.,"Lagerros, Hsieh, Hsieh","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15075782/,Physical activity in 12-24-year-old females significantly reduces risk of breast cancer. Each one-hour increase of recreational physical activity/week during adolescence was associated with a 3% (95% CI 0-6%) risk reduction.,"Physical activity habits are potentially modifiable and could therefore be targeted in a primary prevention strategy against breast cancer, provided there is causality and a sufficiently strong relationship. Our objective of this quantitative review was to provide a summary estimate of the association of moderate/vigorous recreational physical activity during adolescence/young adulthood with breast cancer risk, and to determine whether a dose-response relationship exists. Data sources included studies in humans relating physical activity to breast cancer risk, published between January 1966 and October 2002, identified on Medline, the Web of Science, from reference lists and related reviews. The main characteristics of each study, the point estimates of relative risk (RR) and confidence intervals (CI) were extracted from 19 case-control and four cohort studies. Comparing the highest to the lowest category of physical activity, the summary RR from the random effects model was 0.81 (95% CI 0.73-0.89). This almost 20% risk reduction proved to be fairly consistent, despite variation in populations and methods. Each one-hour increase of recreational physical activity/week during adolescence was associated with a 3% (95% CI 0-6%) risk reduction. Physical activity in 12-24-year-old females significantly reduces risk of breast cancer. Heterogeneity may be explained by different methods to measure activity."

Health literacy issues may influence screening behavior for this population. This qualitative study explored sources of information about breast and cervical cancer, including screening, and identified barriers to seeking such information for Hmong women and men. Researchers conducted semi-structured, in-depth interviews with 84 Hmong women and men living in Oregon. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. Transcripts of 83 usable interviews were analyzed using content analysis. Health care providers and the Internet were the most frequently cited sources of information about breast and cervical cancer, including screening. Other sources were family, friends, and other media. Over half of the participants indicated that nothing would prevent them from seeking information about these topics. These findings suggested that health care providers and the Internet may be important sources of information about breast and cervical cancer screening for Hmong women. Additional research is needed to examine further Hmong women's health literacy needs and preferences with regards to breast and cervical cancer screening."

The theoretical bases for windows of susceptibility is examined, evaluating the relationship between pubertal change and breast cancer as a paradigm, and reviewing the underlying mechanisms, such as epigenetic modification. The long-term sequela of responses to early exposures may impact other adult morbidities; addressing these exposures represents an important challenge for contemporary medicine."

The purpose of this study was to examine breast cancer prevention knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors among college women and mother-daughter communication. Hispanic and non-Hispanic students at a southwestern university completed a breast cancer prevention survey with items for mother's advice, breast self-awareness and risk reduction knowledge, self-efficacy, susceptibility, family history, provider breast self-exam (BSE) recommendation, peer norms, BSE practice, and demographics. An openended item was also used to elicit types of mother's advice. Logistic regression was used to assess predictors for receiving mother's advice for breast cancer prevention and BSE practice. Self-reported data using a survey were obtained from 546 college women with a mean age of 23.3 (SD = 7.75). Nearly 36 % received mothers' advice and 55 % conducted BSE. Predictors for receiving mother's advice were age, self-efficacy, and family history of breast cancer. Predictors for BSE practice were mother's advice, age, self-efficacy, and provider BSE recommendation. Family history of breast cancer and knowledge were not significant predictors for BSE practice. Findings support the need for clinicians, community health educators, and mothers to provide breast cancer prevention education targeting college women."

The authors hypothesize that breast implant-induced local inflammation stimulates immunosurveillance recognition of breast tumor antigen. Sera were collected from two cohorts of healthy women: women with long-term breast implants (i.e., breast implants for >6 months) and breast implant-naive women. Antibody responses to breast tumor antigens were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and compared between cohorts by unpaired t test. Of the implant-naive cohort, nine women underwent breast augmentation, and antibody responses before and after implant placement were compared by paired t test. Sera were collected from 104 women: 36 (34.6 percent) long-term breast implants and 68 (65.4 percent) implant-naive women. Women with long-term breast implants had higher antibody responses than implant-naive women to mammaglobin-A (optical density at 450 nm, 0.33 versus 0.22; p = 0.003) and mucin-1 (optical density at 450 nm, 0.42 versus 0.34; p = 0.02). There was no difference in antibody responses to breast cancer susceptibility gene 2, carcinoembryonic antigen, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2, or tetanus. Nine women with longitudinal samples preoperatively and 1 month postoperatively demonstrated significantly elevated antibody responses following implant placement to mammaglobin-A (mean difference, 0.13; p = 0.0002) and mucin-1 (mean difference 0.08; p = 0.02). There was no difference in postimplant responses to other breast tumor antigens, or tetanus. Women with long-term breast implants have higher antibody recognition of mammaglobin-A and mucin-1. This study provides the first evidence of implant-related immune responses to breast cancer antigens. Therapeutic, V."
The Breast and Cervical Cancer Prevention and Treatment Act in Georgia: effects on time to Medicaid enrollment.,"Adams, Chien, Florence, Raskind-Hood","Evaluation Study, Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19189369/,implementation of the Breast and Cervical Cancer Prevention and Treatment Act of 2000 (BCCPTA) allowed states to extend Medicaid to any woman aged <65 without insurance screened and found to need treatment. The authors used linked Georgia Comprehensive Cancer Registry (GCCR) and Medicaid data.,"Implementation of the Breast and Cervical Cancer Prevention and Treatment Act of 2000 (BCCPTA) allowed states to extend Medicaid to any woman aged <65 without insurance screened and found to need treatment either for breast or cervical cancer or for a precancerous cervical condition through the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP) or in Georgia, other provider sites. The authors used linked Georgia Comprehensive Cancer Registry (GCCR) and Medicaid data to test the: 1) likelihood of Medicaid enrollment in a given month and 2) time-to-enrollment (months) for those eventually enrolling. The authors used difference-in-differences analysis to estimate the effects of BCCPTA for breast or cervical cancer cases relative to a control group of women with other cancers. The authors controlled for sociodemographics, stage at diagnosis, year of diagnosis, and county level factors related to insurance levels in the area. Compared with the control cancer group, the hazard ratio of Medicaid enrollment for women with breast and cervical cancers increased post- vs pre-BCCPTA implementation. The estimated effect of this increase was that out of every 1000 women with breast cancer, BCCPTA led to 1.7 more (from 2.8 to 4.5 per month) enrolling in Medicaid. The results for women with local or later stages of cervical cancer indicated that of 1000 women with these cancers, the number enrolling in a given month increased by 3.4 due to BCCPTA. Results on time-to-enrollment indicated that the time between cancer diagnosis and enrollment was shortened by 7 to 8 months. The Georgia Medicaid program, in response to national legislation, increased the probability of women enrolling in Medicaid earlier and in turn, likely increased their cancer treatment options."
Adolescent and adult soy food intake and breast cancer risk: results from the Shanghai Women's Health Study.,"Lee, Shu, Li, Yang, Cai, Wen, Ji, Gao, Gao, Zheng","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19403632/,Soy food is a rich source of isoflavones--a class of phytoestrogens that has both antiestrogenic and anticarcinogenic properties.

The objective was to evaluate the association of adolescent and adult soy food intake with breast cancer risk in a cohort of 73,223 Chinese women who participated in the Shanghai Women's Health Study. A validated food-frequency questionnaire was used to assess usual dietary intake during adulthood and adolescence. After a mean follow-up of 7.4 y, 592 incident cases of breast cancer were identified for longitudinal analyses by using Cox regressions. Adult soy food consumption, measured either by soy protein or isoflavone intake, was inversely associated with the risk of premenopausal breast cancer, and the association was highly statistically significant (P for trend < 0.001). The multivariate-adjusted relative risks (RRs) for the upper intake quintile compared with the lowest quintile were 0.41 (95% CI: 0.25, 0.70) for soy protein intake and 0.44 (95% CI: 0.26, 0.73) for isoflavone intake. High intake of soy foods during adolescence was also associated with a reduced risk of premenopausal breast cancer (RR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.34, 0.97). Women who consumed a high amount of soy foods consistently during adolescence and adulthood had a substantially reduced risk of breast cancer. No significant association with soy food consumption was found for postmenopausal breast cancer. This large, population-based, prospective cohort study provides strong evidence of a protective effect of soy food intake against premenopausal breast cancer."
Influence of age and education on breast cancer awareness and knowledge among women in South Western Nigeria.,"Effiong, Afolabi, Chinedu",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37584976/,"The rising incidence of breast cancer (BC) in sub-Saharan Africa is aggravated by poor prognosis.

Health education and several screening methods, including breast self-examination (BSE), clinical breast-examination (CBE) and mammography, have been advanced to achieve early detection and reduction in its mortality rate. This study evaluated the level of awareness and knowledge of BC and BSE amongst female students and staff of six educational institutions in Ota, Southwest Nigeria. The participants, consisting of 917 (80.79%) students and 218 (19.21%) staff, aged between 13 and 60 years, were selected using a stratified random sampling technique and categorized into age groups [adolescents (13-19 years), young adults (21-40 years) and middle-aged adults (41-60 years)] and levels of education. Data was collected via questionnaires and analysed using Epi-info software and SPSS version 20. Frequencies, percentages, regression and correlation co-efficient were calculated and used to determine the levels of association between age groups and levels of education. Mean age of the participants was 21 Â± 1.7 years; over 75% were adolescents. BC and BSE awareness was 94.80% and 65.11% respectively, with 7 (0.62%) having BC. The major sources of BC and BSE information were television, health workers and internet. The average BC knowledge score of the participants was 4.06 (40.57%); it was highest among young adults, 4.31 (43.07%), and least among the adolescents, 3.88 (38.78%). The same trend was observed for BSE practice among the age groups. There was a direct relationship between BC knowledge and levels of education; the postgraduates had the highest BC knowledge score of 4.49 (44.89%) while the secondary students had the least score of 3.82 (38.12%). Similar trend was observed for BSE practice and the levels of education. Paucity of BSE knowledge largely accounted for the low BSE practice among the adolescents and secondary students. The huge gap in BC knowledge and BSE practice underscores the need for a structured health education and screening programmes in Nigerian schools to enhance prevention and early detection of BC and other ailments. BSE is free, easy to perform, and able to detect BC at earlier stage. The practice should be encouraged alongside mammography to reduce the burden and mortality rate of BC in Nigeria."

This descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted with 240 women aged from 15 to 65 years admitted to a gynecology-obstetrics outpatient clinic of a private hospital in Gaziantep. Study data were collected by the investigators through a 36-item questionnaire form which was generated using information gathered from similar surveys in the literature. It was determined that 34.6% of women were high-school graduates, and 64.2% had a medium income level.

Some 79.2% did not know what a Pap smear was and 73.3% had not experienced a smear test ever. In this study, we found that most of the women had insufficient knowledge of breast and cervical cancer, while knowledge and practices increased with the education level. Based on these findings, we suggest that there is a need for planning, implementation and assessment of health policies and healthcare services at the national and regional level and we believe that nurses working in the field of protective health services should develop educational programmes for women with a primary focus on cancer in order to increase awareness among the female population in Turkey."

HRT has not been associated conclusively with a predominance of hormone sensitive breast cancer.,"Concern exists that the reduction in breast cancer risk associated with the onset of the menopause will be negated with exposure to hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Evidence from large-scale randomised HRT trials support observational data that have shown a modest increase in breast cancer risk with long-term use (i.e. >15 years) of combined therapy, although this falls following HRT cessation suggesting a growth-promoting effect. Randomised evidence demonstrates that the efficacy of anti-estrogens, aromatase inhibitors and raloxifene in the treatment and chemoprevention of breast cancer are restricted to women with oestrogen receptor positive (ER +ve) disease; however, HRT has not been associated conclusively with a predominance of hormone sensitive breast cancer. Despite stimulating the breast cancer cell growth, HRT has not been shown to increase breast cancer recurrence or mortality when prescribed to breast cancer survivors experiencing oestrogen deficiency symptoms and randomised trials have been recommended and commenced. In conjunction with controlled breast cancer trials demonstrating a therapeutic benefit of high dose estrogens and interest in the use of additive oestrogen therapy in patients developing resistance to oestrogen deprivation, the dogma that HRT is an absolute contra-indication following diagnosis is challenged."

Cancer screening tests are an important tool to combat cancer-related morbidity and mortality. World Health Organization aims to accelerate action to achieve Goal 3.4 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 3.4) in order to reduce premature mortality from non-communicable disease, including cancer by one-third by 2030. This study aims to examine the geospatial variation of cervical and breast screening across districts and to identify factors that contribute to the utilization of screening among women in India. Until recently, there was no evidence pertaining to screening for cervical and breast cancers at the national level. Information on examination of the breast and cervix from over 699,000 women aged 15-49 years was collected for the first time in the fourth round of National Family Health Survey, 2015-16 (NFHS-4). For the present study, the data were aggregated for all 640 districts in India. Moran's Index was calculated to check for spatial autocorrelation. Univariate Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) maps were plotted to look for spatial dependence associated with the uptake of screening practices. The spatial error model was employed to check for spatial magnitude and direction. The common factors associated with uptake of both cervical and breast screening at the district level were; women belonging to a general caste, residing in rural areas, being currently married, and being well-off economically. Being insured was positively associated with the uptake of cervical screening only. This study provides spatial inference by showing geographical variations in screening of cervix and breast across districts of India. By showing geographical disparities in screening practices across districts of India, this study highlights the importance of ensuring a region-specific and organ-specific approach towards control and prevention of cancer. The identified factors responsible for the uptake of screening could be a guiding force to decide how and where tailored interventions may be best targeted."

In this study, many high-risk girls perceive themselves to be at increased risk for breast cancer, and many girls believe that breast cancer can occur in teens. Yet, most girls believe there are things women and girls can do to prevent breast cancer. Research evaluating the impact of awareness and perceptions of breast cancer risk on psychosocial, health, and risk behaviors is needed to develop strategies to optimize responses to cancer risk."

Exposure to carotenoids may be most important during adolescence when breast tissue is still developing. We examined adolescent carotenoid intake in relation to BBD in young women. In 6593 adolescent girls in the prospective Growing Up Today Study cohort, intakes of Î±-carotene, Î²-carotene, Î²-cryptoxanthin, lutein/zeaxanthin, and lycopene were assessed by using the means from food-frequency questionnaires in 1996, 1997, and 1998. Girls reported biopsy-confirmed BBD on questionnaires in 2005, 2007, and 2010 (n = 122). We conducted logistic regression of energy-adjusted carotenoid intakes in relation to BBD, adjusted for age, family history of breast cancer or BBD, age at menarche, nulliparity, alcohol intake, BMI, and physical activity. Mean (SD) age at baseline was 12.0 (1.6) years. Î²-Carotene intake was inversely associated with BBD; comparing the highest to lowest quartile, the multivariate-adjusted odds ratio was 0.58 (95% confidence interval: 0.34-1.00; P-trend = .03). Î±-Carotene and lutein/zeaxanthin were also inversely associated with BBD, but the associations were not statistically significant. Adolescent carotenoid intake may be associated with lower BBD risk; these findings warrant further study."
Breast cancer and the role of breast size as a contributory factor.,"Koch, Nicolai, de Vries",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15325660/,A lower incidence of breast cancer than expected was found in a study conducted by Deapen and Brody in women who had undergone augmentation surgery. The findings seem to support the hypothesis that silicone breast implants have some kind of anticarcinogenic effect.,"Several studies have been published on the incidence of breast cancer following augmentation mammaplasty, with very different conclusions. A lower incidence of breast cancer than expected was found in a study conducted by Deapen and Brody in women who had undergone augmentation surgery, and an anticarcinogenic effect of silicone implants has been suggested. Before accepting this conclusion it is important to study the relationship between breast size and the risk of developing breast cancer. It can be assumed that on average, women who have their breasts enlarged have smaller breasts, originally, than other women. Therefore, it seemed possible that breast size might be the predominant factor, and not the silicone implant. To test the hypothesis that women with breast cancer have statistically larger breasts than women who are not found to have breast cancer, a questionnaire was sent to each of 232 women who had undergone surgery for breast cancer; 146 of these questionnaires were returned. Body mass index (BMI) and breast size were compared against the corresponding values in a population-based control group. The results showed no statistical difference between the two groups in BMI or breast size. These findings seem to support the hypothesis that silicone breast implants have some kind of anticarcinogenic effect."
Prevention and genetic testing for breast cancer: variations in medical decisions.,"Bouchard, Blancquaert, Eisinger, Foulkes, Evans, Sobol, Julian-Reynier","Comparative Study, Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14723904/,"The availability of genetic tests for BRCA gene mutations prompted cancer geneticists to give information about genetic risk. These consist mainly of breast self-examination, mammography screening, chemoprevention and prophylactic surgery (mastectomy, oophorectomy)","The discovery linking the genes BRCA1&2 to familial breast cancer played an important role in the clinical practice of geneticists and physicians. The availability of genetic tests for BRCA gene mutations prompted cancer geneticists to give information about genetic risk and to assess many women with a personal or family history of breast or ovarian cancer to inform them of preventive measures. These consist mainly of breast self-examination, mammography screening, chemoprevention and prophylactic surgery (mastectomy, oophorectomy). This paper examines clinical practices related to hereditary breast cancer testing and introduces a number of results from a survey carried out, between 1996 and 1998, in three clinics located in Montreal (Quebec, Canada), Marseilles (France) and Manchester (Great Britain). Results show substantial differences in the way cancer geneticists deal with environmental risk factors, breast and ovarian cancer testing, and chemoprevention and prophylactic surgery. Differences across cities persist in the multivariate analysis, suggesting that attitudes towards preventive measures may be partially explained by cultural factors. Different dimensions of culture are discussed including the social representation of health and risk, the interpretation of scientific evidence and the role of innovation leadership."
Menstrual cycling and breast cancer: an evolutionary perspective.,Strassmann,"Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S., Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10100133/,"This article attempts to bridge the disciplinary gap between evolutionary biology and clinical studies of women's health. The specific focus is on the relationship between breast cancer and exposure to ovarian hormones during normal menstrual cycling. This point is illustrated by data on the Dogon of Mali, a traditional West African population.","This article attempts to bridge the disciplinary gap between evolutionary biology and clinical studies of women's health. The resulting dialogue is predicted to have useful implications for research aimed at the prevention of women's reproductive cancers. The specific focus is on the relationship between breast cancer and exposure to ovarian hormones during normal menstrual cycling. The clinician's view of normal cycling is radically different from that uncovered by evolutionary studies of noncontracepting populations. This point is illustrated by data on the Dogon of Mali, a traditional West African population with a mean of 8.6 +/- 0.3 live births per woman. The Dogon data include hormonal profiles (urinary estrone-3-glucuronide and pregnanediol-3-glucuronide) of 93 women (sampled twice weekly for 10 weeks) and a census of women's visits to menstrual huts (n = 736 days). Dogon women menstruated regularly only if they were sterile. Otherwise, women aged 20-34 years had a median of only two menses each over the 2-year study period. The median number of menses per lifetime was approximately 100, about a third as many as experienced by an American woman who had three live births. These results contribute to a growing body of evidence that women's bodies were designed by natural selection to spend most of the time in lactational amenorrhea and add support to the view that contraceptives can be made safer if they forego the hormonal swings associated with menstruation. This conclusion is further reinforced by evidence that menstrual bleeding serves no adaptive purpose."
Female preventive practices: breast and smear tests.,"Gil Lacruz, Gil Lacruz, Gorgemans",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24830920/,Breast cancer and cervical cancer are the most common female cancers in Spain and in many developed countries. The main goal of this paper is to identify the determinants of individual decisions on breast screening and smear testing. We highlight the fact that regional public screening programmes improve individual decisions.,"Breast cancer and cervical cancer are the most common female cancers in Spain and in many developed countries. The main goal of this paper is to identify the determinants of individual decisions on breast screening and smear testing, that is to say, the decision to take a test for the first time and the decision to test with suitable regularity. To that end, we have combined analyses of micro and macro data (the Spanish National Health Survey and Spanish Regional Social Indicators) and employed multilevel estimation models. Among the main results, we highlight the fact that regional public screening programmes improve individual decisions on screening (more women testing for the first time and more women testing regularly) and, furthermore, they generate positive synergies; for example, regional public programmes for smear testing improve individual decisions on both cervical and breast cancer screening. In addition, we conclude that it is not only important to know if the numbers of women undergoing breast screening and smear testing are increasing, it is also important to know if they are testing regularly."

Using a cross-sectional study, women at a university in the Southwest completed a 51-item survey about breast cancer risk factors, beliefs, and media and interpersonal information sources. The study was guided by McGuire's Input Output Persuasion Model. Of the 546 participants, non-Hispanic college women (n = 277) and Hispanic college women (n = 269) reported similar basic knowledge levels of modifiable breast cancer risk factors for alcohol consumption (52 %), obesity (72 %), childbearing after age 35 (63 %), and menopausal hormone therapy (68 %) using bivariate analyses. Most common information sources were Internet (75 %), magazines (69 %), provider (76 %) and friends (61 %). Least common sources were radio (44 %), newspapers (34 %), and mothers (36 %). Non-Hispanic college women with breast cancer family history were more likely to receive information from providers, friends, and mothers. Hispanic college women with a breast cancer family history were more likely to receive information from their mothers. Breast cancer prevention education for college women is needed to include risk reduction for modifiable health behavior changes as a new focus. Health professionals may target college women with more information sources including the Internet or apps."

Highest average was the knowledge of symptoms and the lowest that of curability. Most frequent barriers to mammography were fear of learning bad news, pain, costs, and staff unpleasantness.","Objectives: Regular screening for breast cancer is associated with better survival, but compliance with guidelines depends on good knowledge and attitudes. This study aimed to assess the level of breast cancer knowledge, attitudes and screening practices in Lebanese females, and identify their socio-demographic determinants as well as barriers to mammography use. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted with 371 Lebanese females residing in Beirut aged 18-65 with no history of breast cancer. The questionnaire applied was adapted from Stager and Champion. The overall knowledge score was determined with sections on general knowledge, curability, symptoms, and screening; the overall attitude score concerned attitudes towards breast cancer, screening, and barriers; and the overall practices score was for breast self examination (BSE), clinical breast examination (CBE) and mammography. Bivariate and multivariate analyses of socioeconomic determinants were performed for each score. Results: The mean knowledge score was 55.5Â±17.1% and that for attitudes was 71.9Â±8.3%. For self-examination, mammography and clinical examination practices, individual means were 45.7Â±42.3%, 77.9Â±36.5% and 29.1Â±45.5%, respectively. Knowledge, attitudes and practices correlated positively with each other (p<0.0001). The highest average was the knowledge of symptoms (72.8Â±24.7%), and the lowest that of curability (49.6Â±25.7%). Most frequent barriers to mammography were fear of learning bad news, pain, costs, and staff unpleasantness. Higher education was associated with better knowledge (p=0.002) and smoking with lower levels (p=0.003). Older age (p=0.002), higher education (p=0.02), and taking exercise (p=0.02) were associated with better attitudes. Higher education (p=0.02) and having children (p=0.003) were associated with better practices. Conclusion: More emphasis should be placed on educating females on the curability of breast cancer and specific targeting of the barriers identified."

Mean age was 16.79 Â± 1.48 years. Even though 84.6% and 55.2% had respectively heard about breast cancer and BSE, and the 'General Knowledge' of breast cancer was high (75.2%), specifics on 'Risk Factors' (41.5%) and 'Symptoms' (46.1%) were poor.Knowledge on correct BSE 'Techniques' was 52.9%, but few know when to commence (43.1%), the right frequency (31.5%), or the right timing (24.6%). A large majority (73.6%) had positive attitudes, but only 6.1% practice it monthly, while 55.3% had never done it at all. No significant predictors of Knowledge and Practice of BSE was identified. Health campaigns on BSE and breast cancers should provide specific details on techniques, risk factors and symptoms, while emphasizing on the right methods, timing and frequency. The positive attitudes identified raise optimism that health interventions would be effective and can have long term benefits. If possible, BSE and breast cancer teachings should be included in the secondary school academic curricula of resource-limited countries."

The research was conducted at Canakkale Onsekiz Mart University School of Health between November 2008 and February 2009. A total of 77 female students attending the first and second grades were included in the sample. Education pertinent to the matter was provided and evaluation was made three months later. A knowledge evaluation form for breast and gynecological examination, the Healthy Life-Style Behavior Scale (HPLP), was used in data collection. Number percentages, the McNemar Bowker test, the t test and the Mann Whitney U test were used in the evaluation. Despite the information they had received, not all of the students performed regular breast self-examination (BSE) prior to the education. For 24.7% (n=19) the reason for not doing regular BSE was their having no symptoms and for 29.9% (n=23) it was due to thinking that they would not have breast cancer. The reason for not having pap smear test was a virgin status. Three months after the education, knowledge level scores of the students increased approximately three and a half times (from 23.8-9.8) to 81.2-8.0). The rate of having regular BSE was 88.3% after three months, however; there was no pap smear test probably due to the fact that it was a taboo. When the rate of having regular BSE three months after the education and HLPL scores were compared, the scores of those having it regularly and the scores of those not having it regularly were found to be close and no statistically significant difference was detected (p> 0.05). In conclusion, consultancy service units should be established to comprehend the barriers perceived by adolescent girls who do not have regular health screening, to make appropriate strategic planning in order to eradicate the hindrances in Muslim societies and to enhance the motivation of youth with continuous education."

In this literature review, we discuss the epidemiological aspect and the risk factors contributing to this increased risk, and conclude with a summary of current recommendations for screening and surveillance. We also discuss briefly the constitutional predisposing genetic contributions to other cancers."
Fruit and vegetable consumption in adolescence and early adulthood and risk of breast cancer: population based cohort study.,"Farvid, Chen, Michels, Cho, Willett, Eliassen",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27170029/,"There is an association between higher fruit intake and lower risk of breast cancer. Food choices during adolescence might be particularly important. For individual fruits and vegetables, greater consumption of apple, banana, and grapes during adolescence and oranges and kale during early adulthood was significantly associated with a reduced risk. Fruit juice intake in adolescence or early adulthood wasn't associated with risk.","To evaluate the association between fruit and vegetable intake during adolescence and early adulthood and risk of breast cancer. Prospective cohort study. Health professionals in the United States. 90 476 premenopausal women aged 27-44 from the Nurses' Health Study II who completed a questionnaire on diet in 1991 as well as 44 223 of those women who completed a questionnaire about their diet during adolescence in 1998. Incident cases of invasive breast cancer, identified through self report and confirmed by pathology report. There were 3235 cases of invasive breast cancer during follow-up to 2013. Of these, 1347 cases were among women who completed a questionnaire about their diet during adolescence (ages 13-18). Total fruit consumption during adolescence was associated with a lower risk of breast cancer. The hazard ratio was 0.75 (95% confidence interval 0.62 to 0.90; P=0.01 for trend) for the highest (median intake 2.9 servings/day) versus the lowest (median intake 0.5 serving/day) fifth of intake. The association for fruit intake during adolescence was independent of adult fruit intake. There was no association between risk and total fruit intake in early adulthood and total vegetable intake in either adolescence or early adulthood. Higher early adulthood intake of fruits and vegetables rich in Î± carotene was associated with lower risk of premenopausal breast cancer. The hazard ratio was 0.82 (0.70 to 0.96) for the highest fifth (median intake 0.5 serving/day) versus the lowest fifth (median intake 0.03 serving/day) intake. The association with adolescent fruit intake was stronger for both estrogen and progesterone receptor negative cancers than estrogen and progesterone receptor positive cancers (P=0.02 for heterogeneity). For individual fruits and vegetables, greater consumption of apple, banana, and grapes during adolescence and oranges and kale during early adulthood was significantly associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer. Fruit juice intake in adolescence or early adulthood was not associated with risk. There is an association between higher fruit intake and lower risk of breast cancer. Food choices during adolescence might be particularly important."

Whether it also prevents postmenopausal breast cancer, and whether associations are independent of adult activity, is unclear. We evaluated this association among 75,669 women in the Nurses' Health Study II. In 1997, participants reported strenuous, moderate, and walking activity (hours/week) at ages 12-13, 14-17, 18-22, and 23-29 years. We estimated metabolic equivalent task hours (MET-h)/week. Participants also reported current physical activity over follow-up. Breast cancer diagnoses (n = 2,697; premenopausal = 1,351; postmenopausal = 965) through 2011 were reported by participants and confirmed with medical records. We additionally stratified analyses by median age at diagnosis. In Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for adolescent characteristics, physical activity from ages 14-22 was modestly inversely associated with premenopausal breast cancer [e.g., hazard ratio (HR) comparing 72+ to <21 MET-h/week 0.81 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.69-0.95; p-trend = 0.10) for ages 14-17 and 0.85 (95 % CI 0.71-1.02; p-trend = 0.06 for ages 18-22]. However, adjustment for adult activity and additional breast cancer risk factors attenuated the associations [ages 14-17: 0.85 (95 % CI 0.73-1.00; p-trend = 0.33)]. Associations were stronger among women diagnosed at younger ages [e.g., ages 18-22, HR 0.77 (95 % CI 0.60-0.99; p-trend = 0.05) for women diagnosed before 46.9 years; HR 1.02 (95 % CI 0.79-1.32; p-trend = 0.94) for those diagnosed at/after 46.9 years]. Early life physical activity was not associated with postmenopausal breast cancer. Overall, adolescent physical activity was not associated with breast cancer risk. However, we observed a suggestive inverse association of physical activity at ages 14-22 years with premenopausal breast cancer."
Adolescent reproductive events and subsequent breast cancer risk.,"Marcus, Baird, Millikan, Moorman, Qaqish, Newman","Journal Article, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10432916/,"This study investigated the relationship between reproductive events during adolescence and subsequent breast cancer risk.

Logistic regression models used self-reported data from 862 case patients and 790 controls in the Carolina Breast Cancer Study. Miscarriage, induced abortion, and full-term pregnancy before 20 years of age were not associated with breast cancer. Among premenopausal women, breast-feeding before 20 years of age was inversely associated with disease. Oral contraceptive use before 18 years of age was positively associated with disease risk among African American women only. Pregnancy during adolescence does not appear to influence breast cancer risk, but breast-feeding may. A possible increased breast cancer risk among African American women who used oral contraceptives as adolescents warrants further study."
Prospects for the primary prevention of breast cancer.,"Bernstein, Ross, Henderson","Journal Article, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S., Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1311141/,"The goal is to reduce the number of ovulatory menstrual cycles a woman experiences in order to reduce her exposure to estrogen and progesterone.

Tamoxifen, which is effective in breast cancer therapy, provides endocrine control of estrogen-regulated breast tumor growth.","In this paper, the rationale, stage of development, and known or potential adverse effects of three potential strategies for the prevention of breast cancer are reviewed. Two methods--the use of tamoxifen in postmenopausal women and the use of luteinizing hormone (LH)-releasing hormone agonists in premenopausal women--involve hormonal manipulation. In the premenopausal period, the goal is to reduce the number of ovulatory menstrual cycles a woman experiences in order to reduce her exposure to estrogen and progesterone. Physical activity during adolescence is proposed as a nonhormonal method of accomplishing this. The use of LH-releasing hormone agonists to produce a reversible menopause can also reduce a woman's cumulative exposure to ovarian steroid hormones. Tamoxifen, which is effective in breast cancer therapy, provides endocrine control of estrogen-regulated breast tumor growth. Breast cancer chemoprevention trials using tamoxifen among postmenopausal women have been proposed, and pilot studies are under way."

Breast density (BD) is a strong predictor of breast cancer and can be considered an early marker. We aim to assess the association between the mean habitual intake of isoflavones, lignans, and total phytoestrogens intake during puberty until 2 years after menarche onset and absolute fibroglandular volume (AFGV) and percentage of fibroglandular volume (%FGV) in Hispanic girls at the end of puberty. Longitudinal study set up in the Growth and Obesity Chilean Cohort Study (GOCS). We included 329 girls with dietary data (multiple 24-hours recalls) from puberty until 2 years after menarche onset (81% had 2-4 recalls). Two international datasets were used to estimate isoflavones, lignans, and total phytoestrogens in the diet. Breast composition was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry at 2 years after menarche. Multiple linear regression models were used to assess the association between isoflavones, lignans, and total phytoestrogens intake and AFGV and %FGV. The average total phytoestrogen intake was 1 mg/day and %FGV was 50.7% (SD = 15.2) and AFGV 218.8 cm3 (SD = 79.3). An inverse association was found between consumption of isoflavones and AFGV, as well as, with total phytoestrogens [Q4 vs. Q1 adjusted model ÃŸ = -49.2 cm3; 95% CI (-85.5 to -13.0)]. Girls with a higher intake of total phytoestrogens and isoflavones during puberty until 2 years after menarche onset had significantly lower AFGV. Although the intake of phytoestrogens is low in Western populations, higher consumption of them during a critical period of life like puberty could be beneficial to reduce breast cancer during adulthood."

This study used data from 163 nurses and 178 teachers surveyed in Amman to determine 2 dimensions of breast cancer awareness: general breast cancer awareness, defined as knowledge of risk factors associated with the disease and breast cancer screening awareness, defined as knowledge of breast self-examination and mammography. The survey instrument was based on 2 previously validated knowledge-based questionnaires in the literature (Breast Cancer Knowledge Test and the Comprehensive Breast Cancer Questionnaire). Analysis of covariance indicated that family history was associated with general breast cancer awareness. Profession, age, and family history significantly influenced breast cancer screening awareness. The average percentage of correct responses to general breast cancer awareness was adjusted for select covariates (adjusted means). The adjusted mean general awareness score for nurses was not significantly different from that of teachers (P =.8470). Nurses were more aware than teachers of the importance of breast cancer screening and its techniques. The adjusted mean screening awareness score for nurses was 88.3%, compared with 73.1% for teachers (P <.0001). These results provide important information about the level of breast cancer awareness among women nurses and teachers in Jordan and may be useful for developing future prevention and screening education programs."

Women recruited in NHS breast screening and symptomatic clinics in Southampton, UK, were invited to take part in semi-structured telephone interviews or a focus group to discuss their perspectives of breast cancer risk, alcohol consumption and their information needs about these topics. Data were analysed thematically. Twenty-eight women took part in telephone interviews, and 16 attended one of three focus groups. While most women reported a personal responsibility for their health and were interested in advice about modifiable risk factors, few without (or prior to) experience of breast symptoms independently sought information. Many considered alcohol advice irrelevant as the association with breast cancer was largely unknown, and participants did not consider their drinking to be problematic. Women reported trusting information from health organisations like the NHS, but advice needs to be sensitive and non-blaming. NHS breast screening and symptomatic clinics offer a ""teachable moment"" to engage women with context-specific advice about alcohol and cancer risk that, if targeted correctly, may assist them in making informed lifestyle choices."

The findings presented in this paper are from a pilot study of the feasibility and impact of female youth-initiated messages (mostly daughters) encouraging adult female relatives (mostly mothers) to obtain cancer screening within low-income African American families living in a Southern US state. Results are compared between an intervention and control group. Intervention group youth (n = 22) were exposed to a 60-min interactive workshop where they were assisted to prepare a factual and emotional appeal to their adult relative to obtain specific screening. The face-to-face workshops were guided by the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). Control group girls (n = 18) were only provided with a pamphlet with information about cancer screening and specific steps about how to encourage their relative to obtain screening. Intervention youth (86 %) and adults (82 %) reported that the message was shared while 71 % in the control group reported sharing or receiving the message. Importantly, more women in the intervention group reported that they obtained a screen (e.g., mammogram, Pap smear) directly based on the youth's appeal. These findings can have major implications for youth-initiated health promotion efforts, especially among hard-to-reach populations."

We examined, using data from the Women's Healthy Eating and Living (WHEL) study, the effect of soy intake on breast cancer prognosis. Three thousand eighty-eight breast cancer survivors, diagnosed between 1991 and 2000 with early-stage breast cancer and participating in WHEL, were followed for a median of 7.3 years. Isoflavone intakes were measured postdiagnosis by using a food frequency questionnaire. Women self-reported new outcome events semiannually, which were then verified by medical records and/or death certificates. HRs and 95% CIs representing the association between either a second breast cancer event or death and soy intake were computed, adjusting for study group and other covariates, using the delayed entry Cox proportional hazards model. As isoflavone intake increased, risk of death decreased (P for trend = 0.02). Women at the highest levels of isoflavone intake (>16.3 mg isoflavones) had a nonsignificant 54% reduction in risk of death. Our study is the third epidemiologic study to report no adverse effects of soy foods on breast cancer prognosis. These studies, taken together, which vary in ethnic composition (two from the United States and one from China) and by level and type of soy consumption, provide the necessary epidemiologic evidence that clinicians no longer need to advise against soy consumption for women with a diagnosis of breast cancer."

We evaluated the long-term effects of an intervention to lower fat intake among adolescent girls on biomarkers that are related to breast cancer risk in adults. A follow-up study was conducted on 230 girls who participated in the Dietary Intervention Study in Children (DISC), in which healthy, prepubertal, 8 to 10 year olds were randomly assigned to usual care or to a behavioral intervention that promoted a reduced fat diet. Participants were 25 to 29 years old at follow-up visits. All tests of statistical significance are two-sided. In analyses that did not take account of diet at the time of the follow-up visit, the only statistically significant treatment group difference was higher bone mineral content in intervention group participants compared with usual care group participants; their mean bone mineral contents were 2,444 and 2,377 g, respectively. After adjustment for current diet, the intervention group also had statistically significantly higher bone mineral density and luteal phase serum estradiol concentrations. Serum progesterone concentrations and breast density did not differ by treatment group in unadjusted or adjusted analyses. Results do not support the hypothesis that consumption of a lower fat diet during adolescence reduces breast cancer risk via effects on subsequent serum estradiol and progesterone levels, breast density, or bone mineral density. It remains unclear, however, if the results are specific to the DISC intervention or are more broadly applicable. Modest reductions in fat intake during adolescence are unlikely to lower later breast cancer risk via long-term effects on the biomarkers measured."

Population-based controls were recruited, and matched to cases within 5-year age groups. Adolescent phytoestrogen intake was obtained using a brief food frequency questionnaire (n = 3,024 cases, n = 3,420 controls). Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Higher phytoestrogen intake (both isoflavones and lignans) during adolescence was associated with a reduced breast cancer risk, and a monotonic trend was observed from the lowest to the highest quartile (OR [Q2] = 0.91, 95% CI 0.79-1.04, OR[Q3] = 0.86, 95% CI 0.75-0.98, and OR[Q4] = 0.71, 95% CI 0.62-0.82, p-trend < 0.001). Adolescent dietary phytoestrogen intake may be associated with a decreased risk of adult breast cancer. If verified, this finding has important implications with regard to breast cancer prevention since diet is a potentially modifiable factor."

The study sample recruited 189 nursing students who agreed to participate in the study. Descriptive statistics, the Mann-Whitney U test, one way ANOVA test, t test and Pearson correlation analysis were used to analyse the data. 83.1% of nursing students had knowledge about breast cancer (BC) and BSE in the study. BSE was practiced by 70.4% of nursing students; 21.8% of them performed BSE regularly. A fear of developing BC was an incentive for 85% of nursing students to practice BSE. The confidence subscale scores in the third and fourth years of students' university education were higher, and the barrier subscale score in these same years was lower than their first years of study. Perception of benefit of nursing students experiencing breast-related discomfort exerted a positive effect. Nursing students with lower perception of barriesr performed BSE regularly. In conclusion, nursing students' years of university study, breast cancer knowledge, history of breast cancer in family, and BSE practice status were factors affecting their health beliefs. These study results indicate the importance of developing education and training programs which educate not only nursing students but all women about breast cancer, its symptoms, the importance of early diagnosis and of regular BSE."

To support breast cancer control in Peru, this study aims to determine the cost-effectiveness of different breast cancer control interventions relevant for the Peruvian context. We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) according to WHO-CHOICE guidelines, from a healthcare perspective. Different screening, early detection, palliative, and treatment interventions were evaluated using mathematical modeling. Effectiveness estimates were based on observational studies, modeling, and on information from Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades NeoplÃ¡sicas (INEN). Resource utilizations and unit costs were based on estimates from INEN and observational studies. Cost-effectiveness estimates are in 2012 United States dollars (US$) per disability adjusted life year (DALY) averted. The current breast cancer program in Peru ($8,426 per DALY averted) could be improved through implementing triennial or biennial screening strategies. These strategies seem the most cost-effective in Peru, particularly when mobile mammography is applied (from $4,125 per DALY averted), or when both CBE screening and mammography screening are combined (from $4,239 per DALY averted). Triennially, these interventions costs between $63 million and $72 million per year. Late stage treatment, trastuzumab therapy and annual screening strategies are the least cost-effective. Our analysis suggests that breast cancer control in Peru should be oriented towards early detection through combining fixed and mobile mammography screening (age 45-69) triennially. However, a phased introduction of triennial CBE screening (age 40-69) with upfront FNA in non-urban settings, and both CBE (age 40-49) and fixed mammography screening (age 50-69) in urban settings, seems a more feasible option and is also cost-effective. The implementation of this intervention is only meaningful if awareness raising, diagnostic, referral, treatment and basic palliative services are simultaneously improved, and if financial and organizational barriers to these services are reduced."

In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), many cases are first diagnosed in later stages and at younger age compared to those seen in developed countries. Early detection in order to improve breast cancer outcome and survival remains the cornerstone of breast cancer control. Performance of breast self examination is one of the important steps for identifying breast disease at an early stage, by the woman herself. No information has hitherto been available about the frequency of this practice among female university students in UAE or about their breast cancer risk perception and therefore the present study was conducted in Ajman. It was found that 22.7% of the participants practiced BSE but only 3% of them practiced BSE monthly. Marital status but not age as significantly associated with age likelihood. The most frequent reported barriers for BSE were lack of knowledge, considering oneself not at risk and the absence of doctor advice. These factors need to be taken into account in intervention efforts."
"The role of behavioral, normative and control beliefs in breast self-examination.","Mason, White",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18714711/,A limited number of studies have been conducted examining the role of beliefs in the prediction of breast self-examination (BSE) behavior. BSE is the primary method of early detection of breast cancer. The belief-based differences between BSE performers and non-performers found in this study can be used to inform health promotion strategies.,"A limited number of studies have been conducted examining the role of beliefs in the prediction of breast self-examination (BSE) behavior in Australian women, particularly women under 50 years of age for which it is the primary method of early detection of breast cancer. The present research investigated the differences in behavioral, normative and control beliefs between BSE performers and non-performers, within a theory of planned behavior framework, to assist in the development of specific education programs aimed at increasing BSE amongst this demographic group. Two hundred and fifty-three women enrolled in an undergraduate psychology course completed a questionnaire assessing beliefs regarding BSE. One month later, these women reported their BSE behavior during the previous month. Multivariate analyses were performed to identify belief-based differences between BSE performers and non-performers. Underlying behavioral and control, but not normative, beliefs about BSE distinguished between BSE performers and non-performers. Performers were more likely than non-performers to believe that engaging in BSE would be associated with identifying a lump or breast change sooner and detecting a breast cancer earlier in its course. Non-performers were more likely to perceive factors such as forgetting to perform the behavior, lack of time, lack of knowledge about how to perform the behavior, laziness, and a lack of confidence in their ability to identify lumps and breast changes as factors preventing their control over the performance of BSE. The belief-based differences between BSE performers and non-performers found in this study can be used to inform health promotion strategies aimed at increasing BSE behavior in women less than 50 years of age."
Interaction of adolescent anthropometric characteristics and family history on breast cancer risk in a Historical Cohort Study of 426 families (USA).,"Cerhan, Grabrick, Vierkant, Janney, Vachon, Olson, Kushi, Sellers","Journal Article, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14970729/,"Study looked at 426 families of breast cancer probands diagnosed between 1944 and 1952 at the University of Minnesota.

These interactions were evaluated in a historical cohort of 426 families of breast cancer probands diagnosed between 1944 and 1952 at the University of Minnesota. The occurrence of breast cancer and the measurement of risk factors in sisters, daughters, granddaughters, nieces and marry-ins was determined through telephone interviews and mailed questionnaires conducted from 1991-1996. Cox proportional hazards regression, accounting for age, birth cohort, adult body mass index (BMI), and clustering within families, was used to estimate relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of breast cancer. Among 4632 women from 426 families available for analysis, there were 175 breast cancers. There was a strong interaction between degree of relationship to proband and relative weight at age 12 on breast cancer risk ( p < 0.001). Among sisters and daughters of the probands, risk of breast cancer was slightly increased in those with below average weight at age 12 (RR = 1.55; 95% CI = 0.66-3.64), and strongly increased in those with above average weight (RR = 4.25; 95% CI = 1.71-10.5), compared to those with average weight. In contrast, among marry-ins, there was a weak positive association for those with below average weight at age 12 (RR = 1.61; 95% CI = 0.91-2.83), while there was an inverse association for above average weight (RR = 0.75; 95% CI = 0.26-2.16), compared to those with average weight. There were no significant interactions between degree of relationship to proband and height ( p = 0.55), weight at age 18 ( p = 0.22) and BMI at age 18 ( p = 0.63) on breast cancer risk. Family history appears to modify the effect of obesity in early adolescence on subsequent breast cancer risk, and may identify differing etiologic pathways."

Regular screening is the most effective way of ensuring that these cancers are detected at early stages; however few studies have assessed factors that predict cancer screening in developing countries. To assess the influence of household socio-economic status (SES), healthcare access and country level characteristics on breast and cervical cancer screening among women in developing countries. Women ages 18-69 years (cervical cancer screening) and 40-69 years (breast cancer screening) from 15 developing countries who participated in the 2003 World Health Survey provided data for this study. Household SES and healthcare access was assessed based on self-reported survey responses. SAS survey procedures (SAS, Version 9.2) were used to assess determinants of breast and cervical cancer screening in separate models. 4.1% of women ages 18-69 years had received cervical cancer screening in the past three years, while only 2.2% of women ages 40-69 years had received breast cancer screening in the past 5 years in developing countries. Cancer screening rates varied by country; cervical cancer screening ranged from 1.1% in Bangladesh to 57.6% in Congo and breast cancer screening ranged from 0% in Mali to 26% in Congo. Significant determinants of cancer screening were household SES, rural residence, country health expenditure (as a percent of GDP) as well as healthcare access. A lot more needs to be done to improve screening rates for breast and cervical cancer in developing countries, such as increasing health expenditure (especially in rural areas), applying the increased funds towards the provision of more, better educated health providers as well as improved infrastructure."
Believability of messages about preventing breast cancer and heart disease through physical activity.,"Berry, Jones, Courneya, McGannon, Norris, Rodgers, Spence",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29347973/,The study of how health-related beliefs are created and are related to perceptions of prevention messages is a rich area of study that may contribute to more effective health promotion. There was no difference in message involvement or explicit believability of breast cancer compared to heart disease messages.,"The purpose of this research was to examine the relationships of self-reported physical activity to involvement with messages that discuss the prevention of heart disease and breast cancer through physical activity, the explicit believability of the messages, and agreement (or disagreement) with specific statements about the messages or disease beliefs in general. A within subjects' design was used. Participants (N = 96) read either a breast cancer or heart disease message first, then completed a corresponding task that measured agreement or disagreement and confidence in the agreement or disagreement that 1) physical activity 'reduces risk/does not reduce risk' of breast cancer or heart disease, 2) that breast cancer or heart disease is a 'real/not real risk for me', 3) that women who get breast cancer or heart disease are 'like/not like me', and 4) that women who get breast cancer or heart disease are 'to blame/not to blame'. This task was followed by a questionnaire measuring message involvement and explicit believability. They then read the other disease messages and completed the corresponding agreement and confidence task and questionnaire measures. Lastly, participants completed a questionnaire measuring physical activity related attitudes and intentions, and demographics. There was no difference in message involvement or explicit believability of breast cancer compared to heart disease messages. Active participants had a higher confidence in their agreement that physical activity is preventive of heart disease compared to breast cancer. Multinomial regression models showed that, in addition to physical activity related attitudes and intentions, agreement that physical activity was preventive of heart disease and that women with heart disease are 'like me' were predictors of being more active compared to inactive. In the breast cancer model only attitudes and intentions predicted physical activity group. Active women likely internalized messages about heart disease prevention through physical activity, making the prevention messages more readily available within memory, and active women may therefore process such information differently. The study of how health-related beliefs are created and are related to perceptions of prevention messages is a rich area of study that may contribute to more effective health promotion."

Survey questions assessed; campaign exposure; awareness of the links between alcohol and related cancers; intention to change alcohol consumption; and support for alcohol related policies. The proportion of respondents indicating awareness of alcohol as a cancer risk factor was larger post-campaign compared to pre-campaign. The largest increase was seen for breast cancer with 45% aware of the links post-campaign wave 2 compared to 33% pre-campaign. The proportion of respondents indicating 'strong support' of the seven alcohol related policies significantly increased between surveys. The proportion of respondents both aware of alcohol as a cancer risk factor and supportive of the seven alcohol related policies significantly increased between surveys. There was no significant change in self-reported intention to reduce alcohol consumption amongst increasing/higher risk drinkers. These findings indicate that a mass-media campaign raising awareness of the links between alcohol and breast cancer is associated with increased awareness and alcohol related policy support at a population level. However, there was no association found with a change in short-term drinking intentions. A mass-media campaign raising awareness of the links between alcohol and breast cancer is associated with increased awareness and alcohol policy support at a population level but does not appear to be associated with a change in short term drinking intentions."

Lack of awareness and screening is leading to the late presentation at an advanced stage. Study calls for advocacy and larger intervention to enhance knowledge of breast cancer.,"Breast cancer (BC) is leading cancer among women in India accounting for 27% of all cancers among women. Factors that make the policymakers and public health system worried are rising incidence of breast cancer in India and more importantly high death rates among breast cancer patients. One of the leading causes of high breast cancer deaths is lack of awareness and screening leading to the late presentation at an advanced stage. Therefore, the current research aimed to understand the knowledge of breast cancer symptoms and risk factors among women in a low socio-economic area of Mumbai. A cross-sectional study was conducted at Prabhadevi, Mumbai and primary data was collected from 480 women aged 18-55 years. Structured questionnaire was used to collect quantitative data pertaining to awareness, signs and symptoms of breast cancer. Bivariate and multivariate regression techniques were used for understanding of the socio-demographic differentials in breast cancer awareness among women. The study found that around half (49%) of the women were aware of breast cancer. The women who were aware of breast cancer considered lump in breast (75%), change in shape and size of breast (57%), lump under armpit (56%), pain in one breast (56%) as the important and common symptoms. Less than one-fifth of the women who were aware of breast cancer reported early menstruation (5.6%), late menopause (10%), hormone therapy (13%), late pregnancy (15%) and obesity (19%) as the risk factors for breast cancer. The multivariate regression analysis showed women who had more than 10 years of schooling (Adjusted Odds Ratio: 3.93, CI: 2.57-6.02, P < 0.01) were about 4 times more likely to be aware of breast cancer than women who had less than 10 years of schooling. In conclusion, knowledge of danger signs and risk factors of breast cancer were low among women in the community. This may lead to late detection of breast cancer among women in the community. Therefore, the study calls for advocacy and larger intervention to enhance knowledge of breast cancer among women in the particular region with a special reference to women with low education."

Interpretations of the Muslim faith represent some of the barriers for breast and cervical cancer screening. Working to understand how faith influences breast and cervical screening for Somali women, and working with the community to identify and utilize faith-based assets for promoting screening, may lead to life-saving changes in screening behaviors. We partnered with an Imam to develop faith-based messages addressing the concerns of modesty and predetermination and promoting cancer testing and screening. A total of five focus groups were convened, with 34 Somali women (three groups) and 20 Somali men (two groups). Each focus group first discussed participant views of breast and cervical cancer screening in general and then viewed and discussed video clips of the Imam delivering the faith-based messages. Both Somali women and men had an overwhelmingly positive response to the faith-based messages promoting breast and cervical cancer screening. The faith-based messages appeared to reinforce the views of those who were already inclined to see screening positively, with participants describing increased confidence to engage in screening. For those who had reservations about screening, there was feedback that the faith-based messages had meaningfully influenced their views. Somali immigrant women and men found faith-based messages addressing topics of predestination and modesty and encouraging the use of screening and treatment to be both acceptable and influential. Faith can play an important role as an asset to promote breast and cervical cancer screening, and there may be substantial benefits to adding faith-based messaging to other interventions that focus on improving screening uptake. This may help to address health disparities for Somali women in this area."

Given the high penetrance of these mutations, prevention is of extreme importance. Here, we review the literature regarding the role of body size and of physical activity in the context of BRCA-associated breast cancer. There is some evidence to support a protective role of a healthy body size and of regular physical activity among mutation carriers, particularly during adolescence or early adulthood. Factors which increase the physiologic expression of the normal copy of the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene and thereby normalize protein levels, contribute to stem cell homeostasis, and/or affect hormone levels, might mitigate the effects of an inherited BRCA mutation. Preliminary evidence from one in vivo study and from one epidemiologic report suggests that an increase in BRCA1 mRNA expression occurs with increasing levels of physical activity. The prospect of changing lifestyle for the purpose of preventing breast cancer in high-risk women, complemented by mechanistic evidence, warrants evaluation in large-scale prospective studies."

Despite a high level of familiarity (98%) with the word antioxidant, few participants could name more than one of these compounds and most relied on print media (41.6%) and radio/TV (22.2%) for antioxidant information. Thematic content analysis revealed participants' beliefs that antioxidants were strongly linked to reduced breast cancer risk and improved health. They described antioxidant functions that take place before (e.g., ""Prevention . . . a best defense mechanism"" and ""To boost strength and good health"") or after (e.g., ""Fights diseases, free radicals, and cancer,"" ""Acts as a cleanser or purifier,"" and ""Undoes the harm that I am consciously or unconsciously doing to my body"") a health threat. Participants' understandings of the links between antioxidant intake and breast cancer risk did not accurately reflect the scientific evidence. This large priority population group needs tailored, evidence-based nutrition communications to address inaccurate understandings about antioxidant intake and breast cancer risk."
Physical Activity and Risk of Breast Cancer: A Meta-Analysis of 38 Cohort Studies in 45 Study Reports.,"Chen, Wang, Zhang, Xie, Tan","Journal Article, Meta-Analysis, Systematic Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30661625/,A systematic review meta-analysis was conducted. The literature was independently and manually searched by 2 reviewers through 3 English databases. The quality of included studies was assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Fixed-effects models were used to estimate the pooled relative risk.,"To evaluate and quantify the association between physical activity (PA) and risk of breast cancer. A systematic review meta-analysis was conducted. The literature was independently and manually searched by 2 reviewers through 3 English databases (PubMed, Embase, and ISI Web of Science) for data till October 2017. The quality of included studies was assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Fixed-effects models were used to estimate the pooled relative risk and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Dose-response analysis was chosen for quantifying the association between PA and risk of breast cancer. The Begg test and the Egger test were used to estimate potential publication bias. Heterogeneity between studies was evaluated with I<sup>2</sup> statistics. The meta-analysis included 38 cohort studies published between 1994 and 2017, which included 68 416 breast cancer cases. The overall relative risk (ORR) for breast cancer was 0.87 (95% CI 0.84-0.90). The inverse association was consistent among all subgroup analyses. In subgroup analysis by menopausal status, the ORR of breast cancer was 0.83 (95% CI 0.79-0.87) for premenopausal status and 0.91 (95% CI 0.85-0.97) for postmenopausal status. In subgroup analysis by PA type, the ORR for total activity was 0.87 (95% CI 0.81-0.93), for recreational activity 0.88 (95% CI 0.85-0.91), for occupational activity 0.91 (95% CI 0.84-0.99), and for nonoccupational activity 0.87 (95% CI 0.83-0.92). The risk of breast cancer was significantly lower in people with exposure periods longer than 1 year and less than 5 years (ORR 0.62; 95% CI 0.46-0.78), followed by those with lifetime activity (ORR 0.81; 95% CI 0.69-0.93). The ORR for subjects with body mass index of less than 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (0.88; 95% CI 0.83-0.93) was close to that for subjects with body mass index of more than 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (0.87; 95% CI 0.77-0.97). A linear relationship was found between breast cancer risk and PA (recreational activity and total activity), and the ORR was reduced by 3% (95% CI 0.95-0.99) for every 10 metabolic equivalent of energy hours per week increment in recreational PA and by 2% (95% CI 0.97-0.99) for every 10 metabolic equivalent of energy hours per week increment in total PA. PA is significantly associated with a decrease in the risk of breast cancer."

Although a great deal of progress has been made in the health sciences, early diagnosis, and increasing community awareness, breast cancer remains a life-threatening illness. In order to reduce this threat, breast cancer screening needs to be implemented in all communities where possible. The purpose of this study was to examine health beliefs, attitudes and behaviors about breast cancer and breast self-examination of Turkish women. Data were collected from a sample of 656 women, using an adapted Turkish version of Champion's Health Belief Model Scale (CHBMS), between January and May 2011, in Ordu province of Turkey. The results showed that 67.7% of women had knowledge about and 55.8% performed BSE, however 60.6% of those who indicated they practiced BSE reported they did so at irregular intervals. CHBMS subscales scores of women according to women's age, education level, occupation, family income and education level of the women's mothers, family history of breast cancer, friend and an acquaintance with breast cancer, knowledge about breast cancer, BSE and mammography were significantly different. Knowledge of women about the risks and benefits of early detection of breast cancer positively affect their health beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors. Health care professionals can develop effective breast health programs and can help women to gain good health behavior and to maintain health."

Among respondents 268 (69.8%) were married and 144 (37.5%) of the respondents reported having a family history of breast cancer. One hundred respondents (26.0%) claimed they practiced BSE. Level of breast cancer knowledge was significantly associated with BSE practice (p=0.000). There was no association with demographic details (p<0.05). The findings showed that Iranian women's knowledge regarding breast cancer and the practice of BSE is inadequate. Targeted education should be implemented to improve early detection of breast cancer."

Research to inform interventions targeting alcohol consumption as a breast cancer prevention strategy is limited. We examined young women's awareness of alcohol use as a breast cancer risk factor, identified correlates of awareness, and determined how awareness and conceptual predictors relate to intentions to reduce drinking. Women aged 18-25 years who drank alcohol in the past month (N = 493) completed a cross-sectional survey. Measures captured sociodemographics, breast cancer risk factors, awareness of alcohol use as a breast cancer risk factor, intentions to reduce drinking, and conceptual predictors. Analyses examined correlates of awareness and associations between awareness, conceptual predictors, and intentions to reduce drinking. Awareness was low (28%) and intentions to reduce drinking were moderate (M = 2.60, SD = 0.73, range 1-4). In multivariable analyses, awareness was associated with greater worry about cancer, beliefs that there's not much one can do to reduce cancer risk and everything causes cancer, higher perceived breast cancer risk, and stronger beliefs that reducing drinking reduces breast cancer risk. Awareness was not associated with intentions to reduce drinking. Younger age, older age of alcohol initiation, negative attitudes towards alcohol, fewer friends consuming alcohol, and stronger self-efficacy were associated with intentions to reduce drinking. Few young women recognize alcohol consumption as a breast cancer risk factor. Researchers and policymakers can apply our findings to design new or refine existing interventions to optimize their impact on awareness and alcohol consumption in young women."

The authors examined both breast and cervical carcinoma screening practices of women living in rural and nonrural areas of the United States from 1998 through 1999 using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. The authors limited their analyses of screening mammography and clinical breast examination to women aged 40 years or older (n = 108,326). In addition, they limited their analyses of Pap testing to women aged 18 years or older who did not have a history of hysterectomy (n = 131,813). They divided the geographic areas of residence into rural areas and small towns, suburban areas and smaller metropolitan areas, and larger metropolitan areas. Approximately 66.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 65.8% to 67.6%) of women aged 40 years or older who resided in rural areas had received a mammogram in the past 2 years, compared with 75.4% of women living in larger metropolitan areas (95% CI = 74.9% to 75.9%). About 73.0% (95% CI = 72.2% to 73.9%) of women aged 40 years or older who resided in rural areas had received a clinical breast examination in the past 2 years, compared with 78.2% of women living in larger metropolitan areas (95% CI = 77.8% to 78.7%). About 81.3% (95% CI = 80.6% to 82.0%) of 131,813 rural women aged 18 years or older who had not undergone a hysterectomy had received a Pap test in the past 3 years, compared with 84.5% of women living in larger metropolitan areas (95% CI = 84.1% to 84.9%). The differences in screening across rural and nonrural areas persisted in multivariate analysis (P < 0.001). These results underscore the need for continued efforts to provide breast and cervical carcinoma screening to women living in rural areas of the United States."

In 1998, a cross-sectional study was conducted in Brisbane, Australia, among 145 Thai immigrant women, to explore cultural and social factors related to their use of Pap smear tests and breast self-examination (BSE). The study aimed at describing women's beliefs and perceptions about the body, breast and cervical cancer, and their perceptions of the causes of the diseases. It explored the women's perception of the severity and the effects of both cancers on aspects of patients' lives, and their chance of developing both cancers. The Thai immigrant women explained the causes of breast and cervical cancer using both traditional beliefs and medical knowledge. They perceived that both cancers affect a patient's health and her daily activities. Some women believed that they would develop cervical cancer if their perineum or vulva was ""dirty."" Some believed that they would have breast cancer because they had a history of benign tumor or cyst of a breast. Forty-four percent of the women had biennial Pap smears in the past five years and only 25% conducted BSE monthly in the past two years.

Memorable messages originating from medical professionals were substantially more likely to motivate detection behaviors than prevention behaviors.,"Often, people are able to recall a message on a particular topic for a long period of time. These memorable messages have the ability to influence behavior when they are recalled from memory long after initial exposure. Knowing the topics and sources of the messages that are remembered about breast cancer can improve the efficacy of future breast cancer outreach. To this end, 359 women completed an online survey about memorable breast cancer messages. Most women (60%) recalled a memorable message, described it, identified its source, and noted whether it had resulted in prevention or detection behaviors. Four categories of message topics emerged: early detection (37.3%), awareness (30.9%), treatment (25.8%), and prevention (6%). Furthermore, five categories of sources of these memorable messages were found: media (35.5%), friends (22.2%), family (21.6%), medical professionals (15.2%), and others (5.5%). The media were a major source of all four topics of messages, although family members, friends, and the medical community were major sources for particular message topics as well. Memorable messages originating from medical professionals were substantially more likely to motivate detection behaviors than prevention behaviors. This research demonstrates that message topic and source both play roles in determining message recall as well as in determining how memorable messages impacted behavior."

It was a descriptive cross sectional study carried out at the Federal polytechnic, Ede. A total of 393 eligible respondents recruited using a stratified random sampling technique, were interviewed using semi-structured questionnaire after obtaining a verbal consent from them. About two thirds (67.9%) of those who had heard of breast cancer knew that there were screening methods available. Of these 91.6% knew breast self examination, 93.2% knew clinical breast examination and only a third 32.8% knew mammography as a screening method. About half of respondents who were aware of breast cancer practice breast self examination. Only 28 (7.6%) of the respondents had ever visited any clinic for breast cancer screening, and 85.7% (24) of the visit was for clinical breast examination while mammography was rarely done (14.3%). Eighty one per cent of those who were aware of breast cancer believed that screening had a role to play. The study shows that though awareness of breast cancer among respondents was good, the practice of breast cancer screening was poor among the respondents and even worse with screening with mammography. A major recommendation is that initiatives to reduce morbidity and mortality due to breast cancer among young females in the southwest Nigeria should include education on risk factors, early signs and methods of screening for breast cancer."

The study aims were to assess whether the association between phytoestrogen intake during adolescence and adulthood and breast cancer risk varies by estrogen and progesterone receptor (ERPR) tumor subgroup. Cases were identified from the Ontario Cancer Registry (2002-2003), and ERPR status was ascertained from pathology reports for 81% of cases (n = 2,438). Controls were identified through random digit dialing of Ontario households (n = 3,370). Published phytoestrogen food values were applied to food frequency questionnaire responses to assess isoflavone, lignan and total phytoestrogen intake, during adolescence and adulthood. Polytomous multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for association between phytoestrogen intake and breast cancer risk by hormone receptor ERPR tumor subgroups. Among premenopausal women, few associations were observed for adolescent or adult phytoestrogen intake across all tumor subgroups. Among postmenopausal women, adolescent phytoestrogen intake (isoflavone, lignan and total) was associated with reduced risk across all hormone receptor subgroups; however, statistical significance was most consistent within the ER+PR+ subgroup. For example, ER+PR+ postmenopausal breast cancer risk was associated with adolescent phytoestrogen intake (highest vs. lowest: OR = 0.79; 95% confidence interval: 0.65-0.96). Among all women and postmenopausal women, ORs for high adult lignan intake were all below 1.0 within each tumor subgroup, suggesting reduced breast cancer risk, although none reached statistical significance. In conclusion, adolescent phytoestrogen intake was associated with reduced postmenopausal breast cancer, particularly for ER+PR+ tumor subgroup."

A cross sectional survey of one hundred and thirty one women relatives of breast cancer patients was carried out. Participants were selected through purposive sampling, during hospital visits. A self-administered questionnaire was used for data collection. The majority of the respondents (71%) had poor knowledge of the risk factors for breast cancer. Income, relationship with a patient and practise of breast cancer screening predicted performance of mammography, R2=0.467, F=12.568, p<0.0001. The finding shows inadequate knowledge of breast cancer risk factors and poor cancer screening practise among women with family history of breast cancer. Poor knowledge and practise of breast screening are likely to lead to late stage presentation of breast cancer disease. Some important predictors of breast cancer screening behaviour among women with positive family history of breast cancer were identified. An understanding of the strengths and significance of the association between these factors and breast screening behaviour is vital for developing more targeted breast health promotion."

Searching for health information has previously been found to be associated with adhering to cancer screening guidelines, but Internet information seeking has not been examined separately. The current study examines the relationship between health and cancer Internet information seeking and adherence to cancer screening guidelines for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer in a large nationally representative dataset. The current study was conducted using data from the Health Information National Trends Survey from 2003 and 2007. The study examined age-stratified models which correlated health and cancer information seeking with getting breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening on schedule, while controlling for several key variables. Internet health and cancer information seeking was positively associated with getting Pap screening on schedule, while information seeking from any sources was positively associated with getting colorectal screening on schedule. People who look for health or cancer information are more likely to get screened on schedule. Some groups of people, however, do not exhibit this relationship and, thus, may be more vulnerable to under-screening. These groups may benefit more from targeted interventions that attempt to engage people in their health care more actively."

The main reasons for not performing BSE included not knowing how to perform it (57%), not having any history of problems in the breast (39%), and forgetfulness (18%). The results demonstrate that nursing and midwifery education has a positive effect on students' knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors regarding BSE. The findings suggest that nursing and midwifery students should be thoroughly prepared to perform BSE on themselves so they can educate other women about this important preventive procedure."

Previvorship entails the selection of risk management strategies. For women with a genetic mutation that increases their predisposition for a breast cancer diagnosis, bilateral risk-reducing mastectomy (BRRM) is the most effective prevention strategy. However, BRRM can change a woman's breast appearance and function. The purpose of this qualitative metasynthesis (QMS) was to better understand the decision-making process for BRRM among previvors. A theory-generating QMS approach was used to analyze and synthesize qualitative findings. Research reports were considered for inclusion if: (1) women over 18 years of age possessed a genetic mutation increasing lifetime breast cancer risk or a strong family history of breast cancer; (2) the sample was considering, or had completed, BRRM; (3) the results reported qualitative findings. Exclusion criteria were male gender, personal history of breast cancer, and research reports which did not separate findings based on cancer diagnosis and/or risk-reduction surgery. A theory and corresponding model emerged, comprised of seven themes addressing the decision-making process for or against BRRM. While some factors to decision-making were decisive for surgery, others were more indefinite and contributed to women changing, processing, or suspending their decision-making for a period of time. Regardless of the decision previvors make about BRRM, physical and psychosocial well-being should be considered and promoted through shared decision-making in the clinical setting."
Re-thinking breast and cervical cancer preventive campaigns in developing countries: the case for interventions at high schools.,Ifediora,Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31053073/,"Negative impact of cervical and breast cancers in low and lower-middle income countries are worsening. Most preventive approaches to these cancers require government funding. Few countries with the most at-risk population can afford government-sponsored universal vaccination, screening, diagnostic and treatment programmes.","The negative impact of cervical and breast cancers in low and lower-middle income countries are worsening, and, along with other non-communicable diseases, occur disproportionately in these resource-limited economies. Most preventive approaches to these cancers require government funding, but few countries with the most at-risk population can afford government-sponsored universal vaccination, screening, diagnostic and treatment programmes, which, along with socioeconomic issues, contribute to the poor outcomes in these mostly developing countries. An urgent need exists, therefore, to find an effective, affordable, cost-effective, culturally-acceptable and sustainable way of reducing these cancers. This paper advocates a re-thinking in the current preventive campaigns. Using evidence provided by recently-published papers, a case is made for enlightenment campaigns to primarily target teenagers (boys and girls) in high schools of developing countries. Inclusions into the schools' academic curricula are the recommended approach, given that both cancers take hold on populations within that age bracket. This approach, if adopted, may be the only accessible, affordable and realistic approach that gives millions of women in low and lower-middle income countries the chance at survival. Empowering them early instils the self-awareness and confidence necessary for young adults to take charge of their own health. The acquired knowledge, in turn, helps them adopt positive attitudes and preventive behaviours that will, ultimately, prolong their lives. The recommended approach offers governments and concerned stakeholders an evidence-based option that allows them to deliver cost-effective and sustainable life-saving interventions, while hoping to get around the bottlenecks that limit the large scale implementation of other effective but capital-intensive strategies."
Talking about familial breast cancer risk: topics and strategies to enhance mother-daughter interactions.,"Fisher, Maloney, Glogowski, Hurley, Edgerson, Lichtenthal, Kissane, Bylund","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24633365/,"A hereditary cancer predisposition can rattle families, creating dysfunctional interactions.

Families need assistance navigating conversations about risk. Because mothers and daughters uniquely share breast cancer experiences and risk, there is a particular need for practitioners to assist them with communication. Three focus groups were conducted with 11 mothers with an elevated cancer risk (with adolescent daughters) receiving genetic counseling. We explored three inquiries to capture mother-daughter communication: emergent challenging topics (e.g., health-promotion behavior, daughter's risk, mother's risk of death), factors complicating discussions (e.g., balancing what to share and when, guilt and blaming, confusion about risk and prevention), and strategies enhancing conversations initiated by mothers (e.g., paying attention to daughter's cues) or practitioners (e.g., inviting daughters to appointments). Findings suggested that mothers struggle to balance eliciting daughters' concerns, providing them with support, and imparting knowledge without overwhelming them. We offer mothers and practitioners guidance to help facilitate these conversations."

Mortality from breast cancer can be reduced if the cancer is detected early enough. It is important to find effective communication that encourages early detection of breast cancer. This study aimed to measure differences between narrative and didactic communication on breast cancer awareness, knowledge of appropriate diagnostic exams, attitude toward breast self-exam, and intention to screen for breast cancer through a breast self-exam. It further aimed to test whether any differences in outcomes were associated with the format used to deliver the communication: video or infographic. The effects of the communication strategies were tested using an experimental design with a control group and four experimental groups: narrative video, didactic video, narrative infographic, or didactic infographic. A total of 194 Italian-speaking women ages 18-30 years completed questionnaires before and after exposure. Positive increases were found for all outcome variables after exposure to any communication strategy tested. The didactic message delivered in video format had the most positive effect on awareness and knowledge, whereas the narrative video message had the most positive effect on attitude and intention. For both message types, videos had a more positive influence than infographics when communicating breast cancer information for this audience. This was the first study of message effects of breast cancer communication with Italian-speaking young women. Further research is warranted to understand how to maximize communication strategies so that they are the most effective in influencing behaviors and if these results are consistent with other linguistic populations."

Suggestive but nonsignificant interactions with dense patterns were observed for ever having delivered, age at first delivery, breast feeding and body mass index.","The question of interactions between breast density and other breast cancer risk factors is of interest, since it bears upon the use of density as a marker for changes in breast cancer risk. We studied breast parenchymal patterns and 13 other potential risk factors for breast cancer in 172 breast cancer cases and 338 age-matched controls in Singapore. Dense breast patterns were defined as having Tabar parenchymal pattern IV or V. We found significant interactions between dense patterns and ethnic group (P=0.046), and between dense patterns and number of deliveries (P=0.04). Among women with nondense breast patterns, the non-Chinese had lower risk than the Chinese with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.47 (95% CI 0.24, 0.88), whereas in those with dense patterns, the non-Chinese had considerably higher risks (OR=5.34, 95% CI 0.54, 52.51). Alternatively expressed, the increased risk with dense patterns was only observed in the non-Chinese (OR=13.99, 95% CI 1.33, 146.99). Among parous women, the protective effect of three or more deliveries was only observed in those with dense breast patterns (OR=0.21, 95% CI 0.06, 0.70). Suggestive but nonsignificant interactions with dense patterns were observed for ever having delivered, age at first delivery, breast feeding and body mass index. The results are consistent with dense breast patterns as a marker for hormonal modification of breast cancer risk."

The relationship of ovarian cysts to breast cancer risk is not known, although a negative association with polycystic ovarian syndrome has been reported. Incident, invasive female breast cancer cases, population-based controls and unaffected sisters of cases were studied from 3 countries participating in the Breast Cancer Family Registry: Melbourne and Sydney, Australia; the San Francisco Bay Area, USA; and Ontario, Canada. Using the same questionnaire, information was collected on self-reported history of ovarian cysts and other risk factors. Analyses were based on 3,049 cases, 2,344 population controls and 1,934 sister controls from all sites combined. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using both unconditional and conditional logistic regression using an offset term to account for sampling fractions at 2 of the sites. A significantly reduced risk of breast cancer was observed for women reporting a history of ovarian cysts (OR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.59-0.82, among all cases and all controls). This risk estimate was similar regardless of control group used, within all 3 sites and in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women (ORs ranging from 0.68-0.75, all 95% CI excluded 1.00). A self-reported history of ovarian cysts was strongly and consistently associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer. Further study of ovarian cysts may increase our understanding of hormonal and other mechanisms of breast cancer etiology."

To determine how to communicate information about this modifiable breast cancer risk to young women, we analyzed a selection of 32 recent English-language breast cancer messages and campaigns that targeted young women. In addition, we obtained young women's responses to three breast cancer campaign images during focus group discussions. A visual analysis of messages points to an explicitly gendered discourse within contemporary campaigns, one that entails conflicting messages regarding breast cancer, health, feminine beauty, and risk. Although the intent might be to educate and empower young women to ""fight"" against breast cancer, paradoxically, the messages employ imagery that sexually objectifies young women's breasts and bodies. Recommendations are made for messaging about tobacco and breast cancer risk to avoid reproducing one-dimensional or stereotypical presentations of gender and femininity."

To review possible mechanisms, the age group when dietary intervention might be most effective and the choice of a suitable dietary supplement. This review distinguishes specific hormone-metabolic effects of dietary composition from those of body mass and fat distribution, in relation to the age at which they exert major effects on breast cancer risk. Both obesity and a high-fat/low-fibre diet in Western women may be associated with increased estrogen levels which are widely assumed to increase the risk of developing breast cancer. Both obesity and the Western diet are likely to stimulate insulin resistance, leading to increased levels of bioavailable estrogen. The concomitants of hyperinsulinemia may synergize with estrogen in stimulating progression of pre-neoplastic lesions in the breasts of late pre-menopausal women. Increased intake of fibre-associated macronutrients may reduce insulin resistance in addition to reducing the circulating levels of estrogen. The effect of dietary intervention on breast cancer risk in Western women may be tested in pre-menopausal women over the age of 40 y, with evidence of atypical hyperplasia in a breast biopsy. The most suitable fibre-associated macronutrient is still problematical but soy protein constituents have been shown to inhibit the growth of rat mammary cancer models and also of human breast cancer cell line in the laboratory."

We present a risk prediction model that incorporates histologic features of biopsy tissues from women with benign breast disease (BBD) and compare its performance to the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (BCRAT). We estimated the age-specific incidence of breast cancer and death from the Mayo BBD cohort and then combined these estimates with a relative risk model derived from 377 patient cases with breast cancer and 734 matched controls sampled from the Mayo BBD cohort to develop the BBD-to-breast cancer (BBD-BC) risk assessment tool. We validated the model using an independent set of 378 patient cases with breast cancer and 728 matched controls from the Mayo BBD cohort and compared the risk predictions from our model with those from the BCRAT. The BBD-BC model predicts the probability of breast cancer in women with BBD using tissue-based and other risk factors. The concordance statistic from the BBD-BC model was 0.665 in the model development series and 0.629 in the validation series; these values were higher than those from the BCRAT (0.567 and 0.472, respectively). The BCRAT significantly underpredicted breast cancer risk after benign biopsy (P = .004), whereas the BBD-BC predictions were appropriately calibrated to observed cancers (P = .247).

There are limited data on the acceptability of these strategies by Chinese women in an Oriental society where a population-based screening program has not been established and mastectomy is still commonly practiced. A survey was conducted of 1012 Hong Kong Chinese women, ages 18-69 years, to assess the level of knowledge, perceptions, and attitudes on screening mammography and the surgical management of early breast cancer. Most women (58%) had never heard of mammographic screening, and housewives were more likely to have heard of it than nonhousewives (49% versus 37%; p = 0.0001). The majority (82%) of those who had heard of mammographic screening believe that it can detect early breast cancers and reduce mortality, however, only 58% of these women would participate in yearly screening and clinical breast examination despite acknowledging the potential benefits; a lack of time and the cost were the predominant reasons given. Forty-seven percent of women had the misconception that mastectomy was the only curative treatment; when the alternative was explained, the overall rate for choosing BCT rose from 29% to 49%. There was no correlation between age and the choice of surgery. Most women (75%) felt that breast reconstruction after mastectomy was desirable and acceptable. A lack of knowledge on mammographic screening is prevalent and the concept of preventive health care has a low priority in this Chinese population. Mastectomy is still widely perceived as the only curative treatment; BCT with cosmetic reconstruction is seen as an acceptable alternative. Interventions to improve the accuracy of information and to encourage preventive health care behaviors will have a positive impact on establishing cancer screening programs and providing quality cancer care in the future."

Because physical activity can modify menstrual cycle patterns and alter the production of ovarian hormones, it may reduce breast cancer risk; yet few epidemiologic studies have assessed this relationship. The major objective of this study was to determine whether young women (aged 40 and younger) who regularly participated in physical exercise activities during their reproductive years had a reduced risk of breast cancer. Using a case-control design, we conducted personal interviews of a total of 545 women (aged 40 and younger at diagnosis) who had been newly diagnosed with in situ or invasive breast cancer between July 1, 1983, and January 1, 1989, and a total of 545 control subjects. Case patients and control subjects were individually matched on date of birth (within 36 months), race (white), parity (nulliparous versus parous), and neighborhood of residence. Lifetime histories of participation in physical exercise activities on a regular basis were obtained during the personal interview. After adjustment for potential confounding factors, we found that the average number of hours spent in physical exercise activities per week from menarche to 1 year prior to the case patient's diagnosis was a significant predictor of reduced breast cancer risk (two-sided P for trend < .0001). The odds ratio (OR) of breast cancer among women who, on average, spent 3.8 or more hours per week participating in physical exercise activities was 0.42 (95% confidence limits [CLs] = 0.27, 0.64) relative to inactive women. The effect was stronger among women who had had a full-term pregnancy. Comparing most active (> or = 3.8 hours/wk of exercise) women to inactive women, the ORs were 0.28 (95% CL = 0.16, 0.50) for parous and 0.73 (95% CL = 0.38, 1.41) for nulliparous women. Most previously identified risk factors for breast cancer are reproductive and menstrual events that cannot be readily altered. The protective effect of exercise on breast cancer risk in the women whom we studied suggests that physical activity offers one modifiable lifestyle characteristic that may substantially reduce a woman's lifetime risk of breast cancer. Whether the protective effects of exercise on breast cancer risk are due to alterations in ovarian function and whether they extend into women's menopausal years need to be established. Our results suggest that implementation of regular physical exercise programs as a critical component of a healthy lifestyle should be a high priority for adolescent and adult women."

Case-comparison study using written survey. Data were analyzed using measures of central tendency, chi 2 analysis, logistic regression, and risk using odds ratios. General community. A total of 843 women, 450 with disabilities and 393 of their able-bodied friends, aged 18 to 65, who completed the written questionnaire. The most common primary disability type was spinal cord injury (26%), followed by polio (18%), neuromuscular disorders (12%), cerebral palsy (10%), multiple sclerosis (10%), and joint and connective tissue disorders (8%). Twenty-two percent had severe functional limitations, 52% had moderate disabilities, and 26% had mild disabilities. Outcomes were measured in terms of frequency of pelvic exams and mammograms. Women with disabilities tend to be less likely than women without disabilities to receive pelvic exams on a regular basis, and women with more severe functional limitations are significantly less likely to do so. No significant difference was found between women with and without disabilities, regardless of severity of functional limitation, in receiving mammograms within the past 2 years. Perceived control emerged as a significant enhancement factor for mammograms and marginally for pelvic exams. Severity of disability was a significant risk factor for noncompliance with recommended pelvic exams, but not mammograms. Race was a significant risk factor for not receiving pelvic exams, but not mammograms. Household income and age did not reach significance as risk factors in either analysis. Women with physical disabilities are at a higher risk for delayed diagnosis of breast and cervical cancer, primarily for reasons of environmental, attitudinal, and information barriers. Future research should focus on the subpopulations that were not surveyed adequately in this study, women with disabilities who have low levels of education or income, or who are of minority status."

Hence, they face the difficult decision of choosing a preventive strategy such as risk-reducing surgeries or intensified breast screening. To help these women during their decision process, several patient decision aids (DA) were developed and evaluated in the last 15 years. Until now, there is no conclusive evidence on the effectiveness of these DA. This study aims 1) to provide the first systematic literature review about DA addressing preventive strategy decisions for female BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, 2) to analyze the quality of the existing evidence, 3) to evaluate the effects of DA on decision and information related outcomes, on the actual choice for preventive measure and on health outcomes. A systematic literature review was conducted using six electronic databases (inclusion criteria: DA addressing preventive strategies, female BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, 18 to 75 years, knowledge of test result). The quality of the included randomized controlled trials (RCT) was evaluated with the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool. The quality of included one-group pretest-posttest design studies was evaluated with the ROBINS-I tool. Outcomes of included studies were extracted and qualitatively summarized. A total of 2093 records were identified. Six studies were included for further evaluation (5 RCT, 1 one-group pretest-posttest design study). One RCT was formally included, but data presentation did not allow for further analyses. The risk of bias was high in three RCT and unclear in one RCT. The risk of bias in the one-group pretest-posttest study was serious. The outcome assessment showed that the main advantages of DA are linked to the actual decision process: Female BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers using a DA had less decisional conflict, were more likely to reach a decision and were more satisfied with their decision. Decision aids can support female BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers during their decision process by significantly improving decision related outcomes. More high-quality evidence is needed to evaluate possible effects on information related outcomes, health outcomes and the actual choice for preventive measures."

The awareness of breast cancer preventive methods is therefore critical in the reduction of breast cancer morbidity and mortality. This study evaluated the knowledge, attitude and practice of breast self-examination (BSE), among female undergraduate students in the University of Buea. The study comprised 166 female students of ages 17-30years (mean = 22.8 Â± 3) sampled randomly. Data was collected by a pretested self-administered questionnaire. Nearly three quarter (73.5%) of the respondents had previously heard of BSE. Only 9.0% knew how to perform BSE. Similarly, only 13.9% knew what to look for while performing BSE. Television (19.9%) was the main source of information on BSE. Although perceived by 88% of the respondents as important, only 3% had performed BSE regularly. Furthermore, only 19.9% of the respondents have been to any health facility to have breast examination. Overall, although a majority (63.3%) of the respondents had a moderate attitude towards BSE as an important method for early detection of breast cancer, just a modest 9.6% were substantially aware of it. Lack of knowledge on BSE was cited as the main reason for not performing BSE. A significant association was observed between knowledge and the practice of BSE (P = 0.029), and between attitude and the practice of BSE (P = 0.015). These findings highlight the current knowledge gap that exists in the practice of BSE in the prevention of breast cancer in the study population. Sensitization campaigns and educational programmes ought to be intensified in order to address this issue."

We conducted a multicenter, retrospective observational study of patients who used a web-based chatbot before routine care appointments to assess their risk for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, Lynch syndrome, and adenomatous polyposis syndromes. Outcome measures included uptake and completion of the risk-assessment and educational section of the chatbot interaction and identification of hereditary cancer risk as evaluated against National Comprehensive Cancer Network criteria. Of the 95,166 patients invited, 61,070 (64.2%) engaged with the clinical chatbot. The vast majority completed the cancer risk assessment (89.4%), and most completed the genetic testing education section (71.4%), indicating high acceptability among those who opted to engage. The mean duration of use was 15.4 minutes (SD 2 hours, 56.2 minutes) when gaps of inactivity longer than 5 minutes were excluded. A personal history of cancer was reported by 19.1% (10,849/56,656) and a family history of cancer was reported by 66.7% (36,469/54,652) of patients who provided the relevant information. One in four patients (14,850/54,547) screened with the chatbot before routine care appointments met National Comprehensive Cancer Network criteria for genetic testing. Among those who were tested, 5.6% (73/1,313) had a disease-causing pathogenic variant. A chatbot digital health tool can help identify patients at high risk for hereditary cancer syndromes before routine care appointments. This scalable intervention can effectively provide cancer risk assessment, engage patients with educational information, and facilitate a path toward preventive genetic testing. Implementation of the chatbot in clinics was funded by industry support from commercial genetic testing laboratories Ambry, Invitae, and Progenity."

Specified awareness was personal knowledge in relation to breast cancer incidence, risk factors, perception, and level of concern. An awareness score was defined and related to values of several risk factors. Generally, 78.1% of women were aware of breast cancer. However, only one-third (31.2%) of women estimated the incidence of breast cancer correctly; 52% recognized age, 33.9% recognized hormonal contraceptives, and 34.1% recognized hormonal replacement therapy as factors of breast cancer risk. The most frequent specified sources of information were gynecologists (48.4%). The awareness score of women informed by gynecologists was significantly better compared to women informed by other healthcare professionals. However, a statistically significant improvement of the awareness score was reached for women with a higher educational level, information seeking by TV, radio, printed sources, medical books and healthcare flyers. Recommendations for improvement of cancer prevention programs include targeting comprehension regarding the lifetime risk of breast cancer, age as a risk factor, survival from breast cancer and hormonal factors. According to these results, there is an urgent need to separately address the perceptions of women, depending on age, social status and educational level."

Before the lectures, the women answered a structured questionnaire about their knowledge and practices. After the intervention 2,418 of them filled a post-test questionnaire with the same content. Correct answers on the 15 knowledge questions yielded a maximum score of 15. Determinants of breast health practices were identified using multivariable logistic regression analysis. The mean knowledge score increased significantly from 10.9 in the pre-test to 13.5 in the post-test (p<0.001). The percentage with a minimum of 14 correct answers to the 15 questions increased from 18 to 63% (p<0.001). Adequate breast health practices were generally low but increased significantly with increasing age and attendance at a previous lecture on breast cancer. Breast health practices were also higher among married women and housewives, and significantly associated with older age and greater breast health knowledge (p<0.001). Group educational lectures appeared effective for improving breast health knowledge among Jordanian women. However, even with the noticeable level of knowledge at the baseline, there were low breast health practices among the study participants.

Reproductive factors such as early menarche, late age at first full term birth, nulliparity, and late age at menopause increase risk of breast cancer, but manipulation of any one of these factors does not seem to be a realistic preventive tool. Nevertheless, the future possibility of using tamoxifen as a chemopreventive agent against breast cancer is discussed, particularly in relation to women at increased risk due to familial clustering. Alcohol consumption by young women, and overweight among postmenopausal women may also increase the incidence of breast cancer. Consequently, reduced alcohol intake by young women, and weight reduction among overweight women after menopause may reduce the risk of breast cancer."

This qualitative study explored family and clan influences on Hmong women's breast and cervical cancer screening attitudes and behavior. We conducted in-depth interviews with Hmong women and men living in Oregon. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. Transcripts of 83 interviews were analysed using content analysis. We identified four key themes. First, Hmong women make decisions about breast and cervical cancer screening independently. Second, Hmong families do not discuss breast and cervical cancer screening. For some, not talking about breast and cervical cancer screening was seen as a way that family and clan influence attitudes. Third, Hmong families can provide encouragement and support for screening. Although women make their own decisions, about one-half of participants reported that family encouraged or supported them or women in their family to get screened. Fourth, some family members, especially elders, may actively discourage screening. This study contributes to knowledge about potential barriers and facilitators to breast and cervical cancer screening for Hmong women. Findings expand our understanding of clan and male family member's influence over Hmong women's screening behavior."
Fixed and modifiable risk factors for breast cancer.,Fentiman,"Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11695073/,Most patients with benign breast problems are not at increased risk of breast cancer. Those with atypical epithelial hyperplasia have an increased risk and should be kept under surveillance or asked to participate in trials of prevention. Only 5% of breast cancers result from inherited genetic mutations.,"Likely pathogenesis of breast cancer is in two phases, initiation and promotion. Initiating factors include ionising irradiation, dietary factors and possibly alcohol consumption causing DNA mutations uncorrected by repair mechanisms. Subsequent promotional factors include exposure to oestrogens, reduced by late menarche, early pregnancy and lactation and increased by nulliparity, oral contraceptive use and hormone replacement therapy. Only 5% of breast cancers result from inherited genetic mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2, but individuals with such mutations have a high risk (66-80%) of developing the disease. Most patients with benign breast problems are not at increased risk of breast cancer, but those with atypical epithelial hyperplasia have an increased risk and should be kept under surveillance or asked to participate in trials of prevention."

Many are unable to read and write, and speak only their native nonwritten languages, Mixteco and Zapoteco. About one-half of California's indigenous farm worker population is estimated to be Mixteco-speaking (82,000-125,000), and about 20,000 Mixtecs and a smaller number of Zapotecs live in Ventura County. A community-academic partnership conducted mixed-methods research with the aims of 1) collecting preliminary data on women's health needs, 2) training promotoras to assist with this effort, and 3) engaging community members and obtaining their input through community dialogues. Promotoras who were bilingual in Spanish and either Mixteco or Zapoteco were trained to conduct surveys that included questions on breast feeding and receipt of breast and cervical cancer screening examinations. Barriers to and facilitators of women obtaining these cancer screening tests were discussed in small groups. In 2013, 813 Mixtec and Zapotec women completed surveys. Although most women reported breast feeding (94%), and receipt of a pelvic examination (85%) and a breast examination (72%), only 44% of women 40 years and older had ever heard of and 33% had ever had a mammogram. Community members recommended offering free mammograms on the weekend by female providers, having women accompanied by promotoras who can translate, conducting door-to-door outreach, advertising cancer screening on the radio and providing small incentives to women. Trained bilingual promotoras can assist in increasing the capacity of indigenous communities to conduct collaborative research by engaging community members and collecting local data."

Risk management guidelines endorse early detection and prevention behaviors. Despite expressed intent, uptake of these measures remains low. This longitudinal, qualitative study integrated retrospective and prospective data to distinguish factors shaping intent to act from those that are catalysts to taking action to reduce cancer risk. Twelve BRCA1/2 mutation-positive women participating in the National Cancer Institute's Breast Imaging Study aged 18-35 completed two semi-structured interviews three years apart. Researchers completed focused coding to identify points of behavioral intent and action and contextual factors acting as catalysts upon participant narratives. All women shared only two action steps: seeking information about cancer risk and completing genetic testing. The constellation of action steps created a unique action trajectory that was defined, with precise ideas about risk perception and clear behavioral response, or iterative, in which unanticipated life events shifted the speed, accessibility, or order in which risk management and family planning goals were prioritized, planned, or executed. Factors shifting action steps included salient, unanticipated life events, such as infertility, insurance/financial constraints, birth of the last child, or a relative's cancer diagnosis. Focus on cancer morbidity may obfuscate how women prioritize actions, and ignore varied pragmatic, relational, and social factors affecting how intended actions are completed, particularly during the reproductive years. We recommend providers update patients' risk management plans at each visit to assess readiness for next steps and reduce reluctance to discuss, or guilt associated with, change."
Soyfood intake during adolescence and subsequent risk of breast cancer among Chinese women.,"Shu, Jin, Dai, Wen, Potter, Kushi, Ruan, Gao, Zheng","Comparative Study, Journal Article, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11352858/,No epidemiological study has evaluated the association of adolescent soyfood intake with the risk of breast cancer. We analyzed data from a population-based case-control of 1459 breast cancer cases and 1556 age-matched controls. The inverse association was observed for each of the soyfoods examined and existed for both premenopausal women.,"Many experimental but few epidemiological studies have suggested that soyfoods and their constituents have cancer-inhibitory effects on breast cancer. No epidemiological study has evaluated the association of adolescent soyfood intake with the risk of breast cancer. To evaluate the effect of soyfood intake during adolescence, one of the periods that breast tissue is most sensitive to environmental stimuli, on subsequent risk of breast cancer, we analyzed data from a population-based case-control of 1459 breast cancer cases and 1556 age-matched controls (respective response rates were 91.1% and 90.3%). Information on dietary intake from ages 13-15 years was obtained by interview from all study participants and, in addition, from mothers of subjects less than 45 years of age (296 cases and 359 controls). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) derived from unconditional logistic models were used to measure soyfood intake and breast cancer risk. After adjustment for a variety of other risk factors, adolescent soyfood intake was inversely associated with risk, with ORs of 1.0 (reference), 0.75 (95% CI, 0.60-0.93), 0.69 (95% CI, 0.55-0.87), 0.69 (95% CI, 0.55-0.86), and 0.51 (95% CI, 0.40-0.65), respectively, for the lowest to highest quintiles of total soyfood intake (trend test, P < 0.001). The inverse association was observed for each of the soyfoods examined and existed for both pre- and postmenopausal women. Adolescent soyfood intakes reported by participants' mothers were also inversely associated with breast cancer risk (P for trend < 0.001), with an OR of 0.35 (95% CI, 0.21-0.60) for women in the highest soyfood intake group. Adjustment for rice and wheat products, the major energy source in the study population, and usual adult soyfood intake did not change the soyfood associations. Our study suggests that high soy intake during adolescence may reduce the risk of breast cancer in later life."

Community health fairs have developed to address the unmet need for no- and low-cost services that target prevention and education among underserved communities. The current research describes an ongoing effort in a community in Southern California and examines the barriers to health care among participants registering to receive free breast health screenings, one of the major services offered at a 2010 health fair. A total of 186 adult Latina women completed a brief questionnaire assessing their healthcare utilization and self-reported barriers to engaging in preventive and screening services. Approximately two thirds of the participants reported never receiving or having more than 2 years passing since receiving a preventive health check-up. Participants identified cost (64.5%) and knowledge of locations for services (52.3%) as the primary barriers to engaging in routine healthcare services. Engaging with health professionals represents a leading way in which adults obtain health information; health fairs offering cancer health screenings represent a culturally appropriate venue for increased cancer health equity. Implications of the current research for future health fairs and their role in community cancer education are discussed."

Despite various studies regarding breast self-examination practices conducted among health professionals and students in Ethiopia, limited information was found on women attending health care services in the pastoralist community. This study aimed to identify the determinants of breast self-examination practice (BSE) among women attending pastoralist health facilities in Southern Ethiopia. An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 421 women who were attending family planning services in pastoralist health facilities in South Omo Zone, Southern Ethiopia from January to February 2022 using systematic random sampling to select a woman from each health facility in Jinka town. Data were collected using structured, pretested, and interviewer-administered questionnaires. Descriptive statistics such as proportions, means, and standard deviations were used to describe each relevant variable. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify the determinants of BSE practices among women. The mean age of the women was 25.43 Â± 6.66 years. Fifty-four percent (n = 173) of the women had heard of BSE from health professionals. Eighty-nine (21.1%) women had undergone BSE. Women who resided in the urban areas (AOR = 6.79, CI: 3.40, 13.56), attained at least primary education and above (AOR = 8.96, CI: 4.14, 19.35), heard about BSE (AOR = 4.07, CI: 2.07, 7.98), and had a family history of breast cancer (AOR = 7.46, CI = 3.27, 17.00) were significantly associated with BSE practice. Our study showed that women's practice of BSE was lower when compared with the local studies. We recommend health care professionals and others working in the area improve ways of increasing awareness about breast cancer, including its risk, and the need for BSE."

Calorie restriction, but only early in life, provides protection against all three cancers. Most advice on healthy eating is given to (and taken by) the senior age groups.","A recent analysis of Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) data and mortality data has shown that not all fibre sources are equally protective against colorectal and breast cancers. We correlated the risk of cancers of the colon and breast with the intake of cereals, starchy roots, vegetables, fruits and total energy, either concurrently with the cancer mortality data, or from 20 years earlier. The patterns of the effects of cereals, starchy roots, vegetables and fruits were very different, with cereals and vegetables being protective against both cancers, fruit having no effect and starchy roots having a very weak and non-significant promoting effect. There is strong current interest in the protective effects of fruit and vegetables against cancers at a number of sites. Our analysis showed that only the current intake of vegetables was protective. Intake early in life seemed to offer no protection. The protective effect of cereals was manifest both early in life as well as for current intake for female breast and colorectal cancer, but only for the current period for male colorectal cancer. Calorie restriction, but only early in life, provides protection against all three cancers. Most advice on healthy eating, other than that for small children, is given to (and taken by) the senior age groups and these are the ones likely to benefit. In our study fruit intake was not correlated at all with the risk of either colorectal or breast cancers at either time period. Fruit is clearly more protective against cancers of the upper digestive tract and respiratory tract than against the cancers considered here."

There is considerable potential for discussions about cancer prevention between mothers and daughters. However, upward communication, from child to parent, remains a relatively novel research area, and it remains unclear how receptive mothers would be to messages from their daughter about cancer, a topic that may be considered culturally inappropriate for daughters to initiate. In this study, the authors simulated cancer message delivery to daughters and then conducted direct observation of daughters as they recalled and shared the message with their mother or female elder. The authors found that daughters were able to successfully recall and deliver a cancer appeal to their mother and mothers were generally receptive to this message. Not only did mothers listen to their daughters' appeals, but also daughters' knowledge of cancer was considerably improved by the opportunity to educate her female elder. Moreover, daughters' nonverbal communication suggested a surprisingly relaxed demeanor. The potential of young people to have an effect on the screening behavior of their female elders is very promising in terms of reducing cancer disparities."

The increased trend differed by region of residence and family history of cancer.,"The discovery of the BRCA gene in the 1990s created an opportunity for individualized cancer prevention. BRCA testing in young women before cancer onset enables early detection of those with an increased cancer risk and creates an opportunity to offer lifesaving prophylactic procedures and medications. This study assessed trends in BRCA testing in women younger than 40 years without diagnosed breast or ovarian cancer (unaffected young women [UYW]) for cancer prevention between 2006 and 2017 in the United States. This study included 93,278 adult women 18 to 65 years old with insurance claims for BRCA testing between 2006 and 2017 from the de-identified Optum Clinformatics Data Mart database. The data contained medical claims and administrative information from privately insured individuals in the United States. The proportion of BRCA testing in UYW younger than 40 years among adult women aged 18 to 65 years who received BRCA testing was assessed. In 2006, only 10.5% of the tests were performed in UYW. The proportion of BRCA tests performed in UYW increased significantly to 25.5% in 2017 (annual percentage change for the 2006-2017 period, 6.9; 95% confidence interval, 6.4-7.3; P < .001). The increased trend in the proportion of BRCA tests in UYW significantly differed by region of residence and family history of breast or ovarian cancer. Over the past decade, there was increased use of BRCA testing for cancer prevention. Additional efforts are needed to maximize the early detection of women with BRCA pathogenic variants so that these cancers may be prevented."

Data analysis indicated a significant increase of both breast and cervical cancer knowledge for attendees trained as LHAs (pre = 60%; post = 80%; p = 0.000), whereas sobrevivientes had a higher baseline knowledge of breast health (74%), and therefore did not show a significant increase following training (79%). However, sobrevivientes did display a significant increase in cervical cancer knowledge (p = 0.003). These findings demonstrate the impact of training and how LHAs may be recruited at different levels of knowledge and experience and be successfully trained in key program elements. Moreover, results indicate that sobrevivientes may be impacted differently, or require variations in training approaches. This information can be useful in developing and customizing curriculum for future lay health training programs."

Cross-sectional data on CAM use were collected on 2,198 women (mean age, 63 years) personally unaffected by breast cancer in the Minnesota Breast Cancer Family Study. CAM use was compared across women at high, moderate, or average risk based on family history, as well as across categories of perceived risk of breast cancer. CAM use was also examined in relation to screening and general health behaviors, worry about breast cancer, and optimism. Half (49.5%) of the women reported using at least one CAM modality with the intent of preventing breast cancer. Univariate analyses indicated that greater overall CAM use was related to greater perceived risk (P = 0.018), more general health behaviors (P < 0.0001), more breast cancer screening behaviors (P = 0.0002), greater optimism (P = 0.0002), and higher educational attainment (P < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis revealed that general health behaviors (P < 0.0001), education (P = 0.0027), and optimism (P = 0.037) were significant predictors of CAM use when in the same model with perceived risk and breast cancer screening behaviors. Many women use CAM with the goal of preventing breast cancer. General health-promoting behaviors, education, and optimism predict CAM use. Evidence-based guidance is needed for the public and health care providers on the potential and limitations of specific CAM approaches to affect cancer risk."
Superior gluteal artery perforator flap in bilateral breast reconstruction.,"Werdin, Peek, Martin, Baumeister",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20010408/,The incidence of bilateral breast reconstruction is increasing particularly due to genetic counseling and the option for bilateral prophylactic mastectomies. The free superior gluteal artery perforator flap (sGAP) flap is one option for autologous bilateral reconstruction.,"The incidence of bilateral breast reconstruction is increasing particularly due to genetic counseling and the option for bilateral prophylactic mastectomies. The decision to undergo a prophylactic mastectomy depends on the achievable outcomes of breast reconstruction. The free superior gluteal artery perforator flap (sGAP) flap is one option for autologous bilateral reconstruction which has rarely been reported.All bilateral sGAP flaps performed in the department of plastic surgery at the Behandlungszentrum Vogtareuth over a period of 4.5 years were retrospectively analyzed for indication, success rate, and complications.Thirty sGAP flaps were performed for bilateral breast reconstruction. The average age of the 15 women was 42 years and the average body mass index was 20.8. Indications for breast reconstruction were predominantly prophylactic mastectomies (60%). Indication for a sGAP flap was either a thin patient with insufficient abdominal tissue or a 2-staged bilateral reconstruction. 83% of the breast reconstructions were performed secondarily and 93% in 2 stages. The average operating time was 7 hours 12 minutes. Twenty-nine flaps (97%) were successful. Complications were fat necrosis (n = 3), hematoma (n = 3), and breast seroma (n = 1). Donor site complications were seroma (n = 8), infection (n = 1), and wound dehiscence (n = 1).Our results with bilateral breast reconstruction with the sGAP flap show cosmetically appealing results with high success and low complication rates on the breast. However, seromas on the donor site occurred in 27%. In addition, the sGAP flap is a technically demanding and time consuming operation. We recommend the sGAP flap when the abdomen has not enough tissue bulk to perform a deep inferior epigastric perforator flap or for a 2-staged bilateral reconstruction. This is often the case in women with a hereditary high risk of breast cancer who often present as young and slim patients."
Mental and physical health consequences of alcohol use in women.,Hill,"Journal Article, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S., Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7624540/,The health consequences of alcohol use appear to depend on the characteristics of the person consuming the alcohol. Chronic consumption of alcohol in levels typically consumed by alcoholic women clearly produces adverse health consequences. Use of alcohol alone and in combination with psychoactive drugs presents special problems for older women.,"Chronic consumption of alcohol in levels typically consumed by alcoholic women clearly produces adverse health consequences, including a shorter life expectancy. The health consequences of alcohol use appear to depend on the characteristics of the person consuming the alcohol (genetic vulnerability to particular diseases, the particular point in the life span when the majority of the alcohol is consumed, and the pattern of consumption typical for that individual). For adolescence and young adulthood, emphasis is placed on increased rates of accidental and suicidal mortality. For middle age, breast cancer risk and risk for developing osteoporosis is discussed. Finally, use of alcohol alone and in combination with psychoactive drugs presents special problems for older women. Other specific adverse effects of alcohol are reviewed with respect to gender differences in cardiovascular, hepatological, and neuropathological outcome, as well as with respect to HIV/AIDS. Psychiatric comorbidity and domestic violence are also discussed with respect to gender differences."
Cost-effectiveness of risk-reducing surgeries in preventing hereditary breast and ovarian cancer.,"Schrauder, Brunel-Geuder, HÃ¤berle, Wunderle, Hoyer, Reis, Schulz-Wendtland, Beckmann, Lux","Evaluation Study, Journal Article",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28214786/,Risk-reducing surgeries are a feasible option for mitigating the risk in individuals with inherited susceptibility to cancer.

This study compared the costs for bilateral risk-red reducing mastectomy with cancer treatment costs that could be prevented.,"Risk-reducing surgeries are a feasible option for mitigating the risk in individuals with inherited susceptibility to cancer, but are the procedures cost-effective in the current health-care system in Germany? This study compared the health-care costs for bilateral risk-reducing mastectomy (BRRM) and risk-reducing (bilateral) salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) with cancer treatment costs that could potentially be prevented. The analysis is based on interdisciplinary consultations with individuals with a high familial risk for breast and ovarian cancer at the University Breast Center for Franconia (Germany) between 2009 and 2013 (370 consultations; 44 patients with BRCA1 mutations and 26 with BRCA2 mutations). Health-care costs for risk-reducing surgeries in BRCA mutation carriers were calculated as reimbursements in the German diagnosis-related groups (DRG) hospital pricing system. These costs for the health-care system were compared with the potential cancer treatment costs that could possibly be prevented by risk-reducing surgeries. Long-term health-care costs can be reduced by risk-reducing surgeries after genetic testing in BRCA mutation carriers. The health-care system in Germany would have saved â‚¬ 136,295 if BRRM had been performed and â‚¬ 791,653 if RRSO had been performed before the development of cancer in only 50% of the 70 mutation carriers seen in our center. Moreover, in patients with combined RRSO and BRRM (without breast reconstruction), one further life-year for a 40-year-old BRCA mutation carrier would cost â‚¬ 2,183. Intensive care, including risk-reducing surgeries in BRCA mutation carriers, is cost-effective from the point of view of the health-care system in Germany."

Many women, however, are not exposed to information that will promote awareness and early detection of this disease. We undertook this study to determine the missed opportunities to breast awareness information at the maternal and child health (MCH) services of our hospital. Between July and September 2011, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of women attending the postnatal and immunization clinics (ICs) of our hospital. Data were collected using a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire. A total of 492 respondents were randomly selected. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 15.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The mean age of the respondents was 27.67 years (standard deviation 5.92 years). Only 56.1% (276/492) had a postsecondary education, and 58.7% (289/492) were multiparous. Among the respondents, 81.7% had been exposed to breast awareness information at the antenatal clinic, 6.55% at the postnatal clinic, and 5.24% at the IC. There was a statistically significant association (P < 0.05) between missed opportunity for breast awareness information and family income (P = 0.019) and also with the level of education (P = 0.007). Most of the opportunities to educate women on breast awareness were missed at the postnatal and ICs of our hospital.

Subgroup analyses according to menopausal status and body mass may help clarify this association. Data from a population-based case-control study of female residents of Wisconsin, Massachusetts, Maine, and New Hampshire were used to examine associations between body mass and breast cancer risk. Cases (n = 4614) were identified by each state's tumor registry; controls (n = 5817) were randomly selected from population lists. Frequency of participation in strenuous physical activity when 14-22 years of age, weight at age 18 and 5 years before interview, height, and other factors were ascertained through structured telephone interviews. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed using logistic regression. Reductions in postmenopausal breast cancer risk associated with strenuous physical activity were greatest for women in the fourth quartile of body mass index at age 18; the OR for women with the highest activity frequency on average (> or =once/day) was 0.45 (95% CI = 0.26-0.79). Associations with frequency of activity also varied by weight change. Compared to women with no activity and little adult weight gain, frequent physical activity was associated with reduced postmenopausal breast cancer risk in women who had lost weight since age 18 (OR = 0.19, 95% CI = 0.05-0.70) or had gained little or modest amounts of weight (weight gain: first tertile, OR = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.05-0.85; second tertile, OR = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.14-0.66). Weighted MET score analyses yielded similar but less inverse results. These findings suggest that the reduced risk of postmenopausal breast cancer associated with frequent, early-life physical activity may be greatest in women who, over the adult years, either lost weight or gained only modest amounts."

Placing a relatively greater value on future benefits than present benefits was strongly associated with use of BRCA1/2 counseling [odds ratio (OR), 3.0 for one-point increase in future time preference; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 1.9-4.9]. Future time preference was weakly associated with adherence to annual mammography (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.81-2.2), and was not associated with monthly self-breast examination (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.75-1.4). A stronger future orientation was seen in women who had higher levels of education (P = 0.0021) or income (P = 0.0011). Time preference is strongly associated with use of BRCA1/2 counseling. Time preference is more weakly associated with mammography adherence and is not associated with breast self-examination. This variation may reflect the degree to which the behavior is seen as related to future risk."

"Health beliefs, locus of control, emotional control and women's cancer screening behaviour.","Murray, McMillan","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8467279/,Almost 400 women throughout Northern Ireland completed a questionnaire. It was designed to measure the extent of their cancer-screening behaviour. The most important predictor of breast self-examination was confidence in how to practise BSE. Most important predictor for cervical smears was lack of fear of the consequences.,"Improvements in women's cancer-screening behaviours can lead to a reduction in the incidence of breast and cervical cancer. This paper considers the utility of three social psychological models as predictors of such behaviours. Almost 400 women throughout Northern Ireland completed a questionnaire designed to measure the extent of their cancer-screening behaviour, their health beliefs about cancer, their health locus of control and their emotional control. It was found that several components of the health belief model and of locus of control were predictors of the behaviours. The most important predictor of breast self-examination was confidence in how to practise BSE while the most important predictor of attendance for cervical smears was lack of fear of the consequences of the investigation. The findings are discussed with reference to attempts to promote these practices."
Practice of breast self-examination among women in Malaysia.,"Al-Naggar, Bobryshev, Al-Jashamy","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23098479/,The objective of this study was to examine the practice and associated factors of breast self- examination (BSE) among Malaysian women.

The socio-demographic characteristics significantly influence the practice of BSA among women in Malaysia.,"The objective of this study was to examine the practice and associated factors of breast self- examination (BSE) among Malaysian women. For this cross-sectional study 250 women were selected by a simple random sampling technique. The questionnaire was consisted of three parts: socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge about BSE, and practice of BSE. Obtained data was analyzed using SPSS version 13. T-test and ANOVA test were used to explore the relation between socio-demographic characteristics and the practice of BSE. About 32% of the participants reported that they have had family history of cancer and about 20% of the participants reported that they have had family history of breast cancer. The majority of the participants (88.8%) have heard about breast cancer and 78.4% of the participants have heard about BSE. Race, marital status, residency, regular exercise, awareness about breast cancer, belief that breast cancer can be detected early, belief that early detection improves the chance of survival, family history of cancer, family history of breast cancer, awareness about BSE, and belief that BSE is necessary, significantly influenced the practice of BSE among women. Practice of BSE on monthly basis was found to be 47.2% among the study participants. The socio-demographic characteristics significantly influence the practice of BSA among women in Malaysia. The findings of this study might not only influence the planning of specific screening interventions and strategies in Malaysia but might also be important for the relevant international communities, interested in the peculiarities of BSE incidence in different countries."
Breast cancer and breast self-examination: what do Scottish women know?,"Roberts, French, Duffy","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6729539/,"Survey of knowledge about breast cancer and breast self-examination was carried out in 810 women selected randomly from the electoral registers in Edinburgh and Aberdeen. The level of knowledge was poor, but was strongly related to age, social class, previous experience of breast problems and preventive health behaviour.","To aid the design of a health education campaign centred around a breast screening programme, a survey of knowledge about breast cancer and breast self-examination was carried out in 810 women selected randomly from the electoral registers in Edinburgh and Aberdeen. On the whole, the level of knowledge was poor, but was strongly related to age, social class, previous experience of breast problems and preventive health behaviour. Very few women knew of signs to look for other than a lump or of any treatments other than mastectomy or radiotherapy. Although 57% had tried or were practising self-examination, only a small minority knew of the correct technique and when to do it. There may be several reasons for our findings, including previous lack of appropriate information from professional sources, avoidance due to fear and anxiety about breast cancer or lack of motivation because this disease is not seen as an important single threat. These results will be compared with a later survey as part of the evaluation of our health education campaign."
Working women identify influences and obstacles to breast health practices.,"Stamler, Thomas, Lafreniere","Journal Article, Multicenter Study, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10868394/,"Age, education, breast health practices, influences on decision to participate in breast screening, and physician gender.

Differences were noted among three age groups (under 30 years, 30-49 years, 50 years or older) in terms of influences and perceived barriers to the different modalities of breast screening. For clinical breast exams, women preferred an expert in breast health, regardless of whether the professional was a physician or a nurse. In all groups, the physician was noted as being very influential; however, perceptions of encouragement from the physician varied across the age groups. Perceptions of barriers to breast screening differed among the age groups and between women with male physicians and those with female physicians. Coworkers were identified as being a strong influence in the older group, whereas friends and family were identified as being more influential in the younger groups. Health promotion and education strategies may need to be stratified for different age groups. Breast health education may need to be seen as an ongoing educational process, with the target groups being both the women and the primary healthcare professionals. The worksite has strong potential as a setting for health promotion activities."
The addition of internists to a breast health program.,"Battaglia, Howard, Kavanah, Prout, Chapman, David, McKinney, Kronman, Dumont, Freund","Evaluation Study, Journal Article",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22098389/,"The Breast Health Center at Boston Medical Center is a multidisciplinary program. Internists provide care alongside breast surgeons, radiologists, and patient navigators. From 2007 to 2009, internists cared for 2,408 women, representing half of all referrals.","With the increases in complexity of care for breast health concerns, there is a growing need for efficient and effective clinical evaluation, especially for vulnerable populations at risk for poor outcomes. The Breast Health Center at Boston Medical Center is a multidisciplinary program, with internists providing care alongside breast surgeons, radiologists, and patient navigators. Using a triage system previously shown to have high provider and patient satisfaction, and the ability to provide timely care, patients are assigned to either a breast surgeon or internist. From 2007 to 2009, internists cared for 2,408 women, representing half of all referrals. Women served were diverse in terms of race (33% black, 30% Hispanic, 5% Asian), language (34% require language interpreter), and insurance status (51% had no insurance or public insurance). Most presented with an abnormal screen (breast examination 54% or imaging 4%) while the remainder were seen for symptoms such as pain (26%), non-bloody nipple discharge (4%), or risk assessment (7%). A majority of final diagnoses were made through clinical evaluation alone (n = 1,760, 73%), without the need for additional diagnostic imaging or tissue sampling; 9% (n = 214) received a benign diagnosis with the aid of breast imaging; 19% (n = 463) required tissue sampling. Only 4% went on to see a breast surgeon. Internists diagnosed 15 incident cancers with a median time to diagnosis of 19 days. Patient and provider satisfaction was high. These data suggest that a group of appropriately trained internists can provide quality breast care to a vulnerable population in a multidisciplinary setting. Replication of this model requires the availability of more clinical training programs for non-surgical providers."
Effectiveness of educational intervention in raising knowledge regarding breast cancer among female nurses.,"Razzaque, Zafar, Ali, Hussain, Qureshi",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34418009/,Nursing educational session was found to have increased nurses' knowledge related to breast cancer.

Impact of a smoking and alcohol intervention programme on lung and breast cancer incidence in Denmark: An example of dynamic modelling with Prevent.,"Soerjomataram, de Vries, Engholm, Paludan-MÃ¼ller, BrÃ¸nnum-Hansen, Storm, Barendregt","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20843490/,Smoking is clearly related to the incidence of lung cancer and alcohol consumption is to breast cancer. We modelled the potential benefits of reductions in smoking or alcohol prevalence for the burden of these cancers. Up to 49% less new lung cancer cases can be expected in 2050 if smoking were to be completely eliminated.,"Among the known risk factors, smoking is clearly related to the incidence of lung cancer and alcohol consumption is to breast cancer. In this manuscript we modelled the potential benefits of reductions in smoking or alcohol prevalence for the burden of these cancers. We used Prevent v.3.01 to assess the changes in incidence as a result of risk factor changes. Incidence of lung and breast cancer until 2050 was predicted under two scenarios: ideal (total elimination of smoking and reduction of alcohol intake to maximum 1 units/d for women) and optimistic (decreasing prevalence of risk factors because of a 10% increase in cigarette and alcohol beverage price, repeated every 5 years). Danish data from the household surveys, cancer registration and Eurostat were used. Up to 49% less new lung cancer cases can be expected in 2050 if smoking were to be completely eliminated. Five-yearly 10% price increases may prevent 521 new lung cancer cases in 2050 (21% less cases). An intervention that immediately reduces population alcohol consumption to the recommended level (below 12 g/d) may lower breast cancer by 7%, preventing 445 out of the 6060 expected new cases in 2050. Five-yearly 10% price increases in alcoholic beverages achieved a reduction of half as expected by the ideal scenario, i.e. 4% (262) preventable cases in 2050. The future burden of lung and breast cancer could be markedly reduced by intervening in their risk factors. Prevent illustrates the benefit of interventions and may serve as guidance in political decision-making."

Placental characteristics and reduced risk of maternal breast cancer.,"Cohn, Cirillo, Christianson, van den Berg, Siiteri","Journal Article, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S., Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11481384/,"Smaller placentas, maternal floor infarction of the placenta, and increasing blood pressure during pregnancy were associated with reduced maternal breast cancer. Elucidating the mechanisms for these associations could provide clues to breast cancer prevention and treatment.","Women who have preeclampsia during pregnancy are at reduced risk of subsequent breast cancer. We examined whether other markers of reduced placental size or function, including increased blood pressure during pregnancy, predict a reduction in maternal breast cancer. The Child Health and Development Studies is a 40-year follow-up of pregnant women enrolled in the Kaiser Permanente health plan between 1959 and 1967. We identified 3804 white women for whom data were available on placental examinations and other study variables. As of 1997, 146 women had developed invasive breast cancer. Proportional hazards models were used to estimate associations of breast cancer with markers of placental function. All statistical tests were two-sided. A blood pressure increase between the second and third trimesters exhibited a linear relationship with breast cancer rate, with the highest quartile showing a 51% reduction (95% confidence interval [CI] = 20% to 70%) that was not explained by preeclampsia. Smaller placental diameter was independently associated with a reduced breast cancer rate; the association increased with age at first pregnancy (P =.008). Maternal floor infarction of the placenta was associated with a 60% reduction in breast cancer rate (95% CI = 12% to 82%). In combination, placental risk factors were associated with a reduction in the breast cancer rate of as high as 94% (95% CI = 80% to 98%). Smaller placentas, maternal floor infarction of the placenta, and increasing blood pressure during pregnancy were associated with reduced maternal breast cancer. In the case of smaller placental diameter, the larger reduction observed with older age at first pregnancy suggests a process in which promotion of an existing lesion is blocked. Elucidating the mechanisms for these associations could provide clues to breast cancer prevention and treatment."

On average, 85% of the components of the palpation technique were correctly included in the participants' self-examinations, indicating that they had been trained competently. Breast self-examiners then were asked to palpate three breast models in search of embedded lumps. Thirteen health professionals were asked to examine the same breast models for lumps. The examination of the models by self-examiners was compared to that by health professionals. Breast self-examiners took longer to examine each model, and on average correctly identified significantly more lumps than health professionals. The two groups did not differ in number of false-positive findings. These results indicate that women adequately trained to perform breast self-examination can perform breast examinations at least as accurately as health professionals."

This study aimed to provide information about women's understanding of breast cancer incidence and risk of disease. Based on a newly developed questionnaire 2108 healthy women were asked about their knowledge and perceptions in relation to breast cancer incidence, risk factors, risk perception and level of concern. Of these women 78.8% were well aware of breast cancer in general terms. However, there were major aspects such as incidence or risk factors that were poorly understood. Only one-third correctly estimated the incidence of breast cancer; 95% understood breast cancer in the familial history as a risk factor, but only 57% understood the age risk; 37.1% of women perceived hormonal contraceptives and 35.9% hormonal replacement therapy as risk factors of breast cancer. The latter estimation was significantly higher in women above 40 years. Recommendations for the improvement of cancer prevention programmes include targeting understanding of lifetime risk of breast cancer, age as a risk factor, survival from breast cancer or hormonal factors. There is a need to separately address the perceptions of women depending on age, social status and educational levels."

Study subjects included breast cancer cases aged 20-79 years identified from four statewide cancer registries and randomly selected controls interviewed from 1988 to 1996. Complete information on a comprehensive set of risk factors for breast cancer was available for 9,891 cases and 12,271 controls. The large number of subjects enabled simultaneous adjustment of the covariates and efficient application of various modeling approaches. Overall, each 5-year increase in age at first FP was associated with an odds ratio of 1.07 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01, 1.13) for breast cancer. The corresponding estimates were odds ratio = 1.02 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.05) for age at second through ninth FPs. For age at last FP, the effect estimate (odds ratio = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.97, 1.06) was indistinguishable from that for other FPs after the first. In this analysis, a modest and transient increase in breast cancer risk after childbirth was also observed. The relatively greater effect of age at first FP is consistent with the existence of a long-term effect of early first FP on the differentiation of mammary cells, causing them to become less susceptible to carcinogenesis."

The difficult questions are: (1) does a truly hereditary breast cancer subset exist; (2) which familial aggregations are hereditary; and (3) is the hereditary form distinctive from its sporadic counterpart? These queries will be resolved once biomarkers are identified that show high sensitivity and specificity with genotype. The authors provide a review of this subject and will focus on their recent discovery of increased in vitro hyperdiploidy in cultured skin fibroblasts from patients with or at risk for hereditary breast cancer. The authors discuss findings from their study of family histories in 225 consecutively ascertained patients with verified breast cancer from the Creighton University School of Medicine Oncology Clinic. Findings consistent with an hereditary breast cancer syndrome were identified in 5% of the patients. Given the 112,000 new cases of breast cancer in the United States in 1982, the authors estimate that with a confidence coefficient of 0.95 between 2410 and 8790 of these individuals will manifest hereditary breast cancer. Specific surveillance/management programs should be geared to high-risk members of these families in which cancer yield will be predictable."

Marital status and religion had no effect on attitude, but increasing educational status significantly increased knowledge and positive attitude towards breast cancer examination (Ï‡2=4.255, p=0.0391). The majority (92.0%) agreed that men can assist in early breast cancer detection and 96.2% were willing to be provided with breast examination skills. Although level of awareness on female breast cancers among the men was high, they generally lack knowledge of the disease. Majority of male partners want to assist in early breast cancer detection if provided with the necessary skills."

Walking and running to benefit breast cancer: descriptive characteristics of participants in the 2017 Walk for Life events.,"Bernhart, O'Neill",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31070509/,"Few studies have examined for-cause events through a public health perspective to determine the reach and potential for public health and PA promotion. Participants registered online for the Walk for Life events in Columbia, SC (Half marathon, 10k, 5k, and Walk-a-thon), were included in this study.","The prevalence of charities and other non-profit organisations sponsoring for-cause physical activity (PA) events has continued to rise. Few studies have examined for-cause events through a public health perspective to determine the reach and potential for public health and PA promotion. This study described participants in a for-cause event supporting breast cancer to determine the reach of the event and identified possible leverage points of for-cause events for public health promotion. Participants registered online for the Walk for Life events in Columbia, SC (Half marathon, 10k, 5k, and Walk-a-thon), were included in this study. Data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel. Over 6,000 people participated in the event and 4,942 registered online. Of online registrants, most participants were women (<i>n</i> = 3,800, 78.95%) and most participants, completed the walk-a-thon (<i>n</i> = 3,539), followed by the 5k (<i>n</i> = 829), half-marathon (<i>n</i> = 236), and 10k (<i>n</i> = 209). The average age of participants was 39.79 years (SD = 1.35). For-cause PA events often recruit high numbers of participants, particularly high-priority populations in PA interventions. Therefore, these events bear innovative implications for PA researchers and practitioners to leverage these events to promote health and PA while simultaneously supporting charity and non-profit organisations."
Celebrity Influence and Identification: A Test of the Angelina Effect.,"Kosenko, Binder, Hurley",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26192626/,"Angelina Jolie's announcement that she is a BRCA1 carrier and has had a prophylactic bilateral mastectomy was met with widespread support.

These speculations were the subject of a Time magazine cover story titled ""The Angelina Effect"" (Kluger et al., 2013 ). Although there is anecdotal evidence to support this hypothesized Angelina effect, empirical tests are lacking. To explore possible links between Angelina's announcement and public health, we surveyed 356 adults immediately after the announcement. Guided by a model of celebrity influence, the survey assessed participants' demographics and health history, identification and parasocial interaction with Jolie, and genetic testing intentions. Results supported the model's predictions and provided preliminary evidence of an Angelina effect."

Breast cancer awareness messages: investigating response among Lebanese women.,"El-Khoury, Mady",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38747514/,"Lebanese study examined effectiveness of direct versus indirect messaging. Findings suggest that the designed breast cancer communication messages were perceived as informative, trustworthy and believable regardless of message type. Making these messages available to all age groups and motivating them to take proactive/preventative measures becomes even more significant.","While national Lebanese studies done on breast cancer attest to the importance of awareness campaigns none, however, examine the type of content that most effectively reaches women. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to examine, through an experiment, the effectiveness of direct versus indirect messaging, in altering knowledge, risk perception, attitudes, behaviors and self-efficacy among two groups of women, those aged 18-40 and 41-65 years. Findings suggest that the designed breast cancer communication messages were perceived as informative, trustworthy and believable regardless of message type. An interaction effect indicated that the older age group (41+) who were exposed to the indirect message felt more confident in taking proactive measures than the 18- to 40-year-old participants. In addition, those exposed to the indirect message were more likely to behave as communicated than those in the direct message condition. At the very least, the messages, both direct and indirect, helped minimize misconception or correct people's knowledge about the subject. This shows that participants and by extension people, in general, pay attention to breast cancer awareness messaging. Making these messages available to all age groups and motivating them to take proactive/preventative measures becomes even more significant, especially with the higher incidence of cancer among women aged 18-40 years in Lebanon."
"Effect of health care system distrust on breast and cervical cancer screening in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.","Yang, Matthews, Hillemeier","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21566035/,High levels of health care system distrust were associated with lower utilization of breast and cervical cancer screening services. A high level of competence distrust was associated with a reduced likelihood of having Papanicolaou tests. Women with high levels of values distrust were less likely to have breast examinations within the recommended time period.,"We investigated whether health care system distrust is a barrier to breast and cervical cancer screening and whether different dimensions of distrust-values and competence-have different impacts on cancer screening. We utilized data on 5268 women aged 18 years and older living in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and analyzed their use of screening services via logistic and multinomial logistic regression. High levels of health care system distrust were associated with lower utilization of breast and cervical cancer screening services. The associations differed by dimensions of distrust. Specifically, a high level of competence distrust was associated with a reduced likelihood of having Papanicolaou tests, and women with high levels of values distrust were less likely to have breast examinations within the recommended time period. Independent of other covariates, individual health care resources and health status were associated with utilization of cancer screening. Health care system distrust is a barrier to breast and cervical cancer screening even after control for demographic and socioeconomic determinants. Rebuilding confidence in the health care system may improve personal and public health by increasing the utilization of preventive health services."

A household survey was conducted among a representative sample (n=1500) of over 18 years of age resident in the district of Colombo. Results indicated that both groups of information needs were considered as highly important.,"Background: Information needs of Breast Cancer (BC) and its perceived importance has not been adequately assessed in Sri Lanka. The present study aimed to assess cognitive information needs of BC among the adults. Methods: A household survey was conducted among a representative sample (n=1500) of over 18 years of age resident in the district of Colombo not having BC patients in the families. A validated interviewer-administered questionnaire collected information on general and cognitive information needs. Exploratory factor analysis assessed whether any of the aspects of informational needs are redundant and to group the needs. Results: Mean age of the participants was 37.21 (SD = Â±9.7) years. Proportion of females was 51.7%, 82.9% were married and 44.1% had been educated up to General Certificate of Education (GCE) Ordinary Level. Exploratory factor analysis revealed all items of the questionnaire to form two groups that were named as â€œFactual information on BC prevention and early detection (screening and early diagnosis)â€ and â€œFactual information on BC diagnosis and treatmentâ€. Results indicated that both groups of information needs were considered as highly important and the group â€œFactual information on BC diagnosis and treatmentâ€ (mean score 4.20 Â± 0.75) was perceived as more important than the other group. The perceived importance of information needs was shown to be significantly different based on the sex of the adults, marital status, level of education and the employment status of the participants. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that cognitive information needs on BC are viewed as highly important by the general public. The study identified specific informational needs that are perceived as more important and some socio-demographic characteristics that are associated with higher perceived needs. The study recommends taking into account the findings of the study in designing the content and target groups for education on BC."
Psychosocial predictors of breast self-examination behavior among female students: an application of the health belief model using logistic regression.,"Didarloo, Nabilou, Khalkhali",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29100508/,"Study was a cross-sectional survey carried out with 334 female students at Urmia University of Medical Sciences in the northwest of Iran. 82 of the 334 participants (24.6%) reported practicing BSEs. High perceived severity, benefits, and self-efficacy were better predictors of BSE behavior.","Breast cancer is a life-threatening condition affecting women around the world. The early detection of breast lumps using a breast self-examination (BSE) is important for the prevention and control of this disease. The aim of this study was to examine BSE behavior and its predictive factors among female university students using the Health Belief Model (HBM). This investigation was a cross-sectional survey carried out with 334 female students at Urmia University of Medical Sciences in the northwest of Iran. To collect the necessary data, researchers applied a valid and reliable three-part questionnaire. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and a chi-square test, in addition to multivariate logistic regression statistics in SPSS software version 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The results indicated that 82 of the 334 participants (24.6%) reported practicing BSEs. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that high perceived severity [OR = 2.38, 95% CI = (1.02-5.54)], high perceived benefits [OR = 1.94, 95% CI = (1.09-3.46)], and high perceived self-efficacy [OR = 13.15, 95% CI = (3.64-47.51)] were better predictors of BSE behavior (P < 0.05) than low perceived severity, benefits, and self-efficacy. The findings also showed that a high level of knowledge compared to a low level of knowledge [OR = 5.51, 95% CI = (1.79-16.86)] and academic undergraduate and graduate degrees compared to doctoral degrees [OR = 2.90, 95% CI = (1.42-5.92)] of the participants were predictors of BSE performance (P < 0.05). The study revealed that the HBM constructs are able to predict BSE behavior. Among these constructs, self-efficacy was the most important predictor of the behavior. Interventions based on the constructs of perceived self-efficacy, benefits, and severity are recommended for increasing women's regular screening for breast cancer."

A convenient sample of 212 Nursing students at the Faculty of Nursing, Alexandria University, who accepted to participate in the study and enrolled in the first academic year, during the first semester (2001-2002) were included in this study. A specially designed, self-administered questionnaire sheet was used and analyzed to determine the level of Nursing students' knowledge and practices related to BSE. According to Nursing students' needs, an educational booklet about BSE was developed and given to them. After 3 months, reassessment of Nursing students' knowledge and practices was carried out using the same questionnaire sheet to evaluate the effectiveness of the developed booklet. The study revealed a general lack of knowledge and practices related to BSE among Nursing students, where poor total score of knowledge and practices was obtained by most of them before distribution of the educational booklet. The study also revealed that the developed educational booklet about BSE had an obvious effect on improving Nursing students' knowledge and practices regarding BSE, where a highly significant difference was found between their knowledge and practices before and after distribution of the educational booklet. So, improving the health behavior, especially BSE, among Nursing students is needed to help them assume their responsibility towards prevention. This should be carried through the use of the currently developed educational booklet about BSE by all Nursing students."

These characteristics were predictive of changes in breast cancer worry and knowledge across time.,"The purpose of this paper was to demonstrate how living in neighborhoods with high levels of poverty (while controlling for personal income) impacts personal characteristics, which in turn impacts retention of breast cancer risk knowledge and changes in worry and perceived risk. The data from this project come from a larger, National Cancer Institute-funded study that included a pretest, a breast cancer risk education session, a posttest, the option of an individualized risk assessment via the Gail Model and three follow-up phone calls over the next 9 months. The percent of individuals living below poverty in the community in which the participant resided was predictive of the personal characteristics assessed, and these characteristics were predictive of changes in breast cancer worry and knowledge across time. Differentiation of self and monitoring, two of the individual characteristics that seem to allow people to process and use information to make ""rational"" decisions about health care, seem to be impacted by the necessity for adaptation to a culture of poverty. Thus, as a health care community, we need to tailor our messages and our recommendations with an understanding of the complex intersection of poverty and health care decision making."

Mistrust of Western medicine and the health care system, as well as experiences of discrimination in health care, may be barriers to seeking health care for this population. In this study, we explored medical mistrust among Hmong women and men, their experiences with discrimination in health care, and how these factors may influence Hmong women's breast and cervical cancer screening behavior. We conducted semi-structured, in-depth interviews with women and men who were members of the Hmong community in Oregon. Transcripts of 83 interviews were analyzed using content analysis. Despite personally trusting Western medicine and the health care system, participants shared reasons that some Hmong people feel mistrust including lack of understanding or familiarity, culture, and tradition. Although mistrust was thought to result in delaying or avoiding breast or cervical cancer screening, more frequently trust was described as positively influencing screening. In addition, few participants reported being treated differently during breast or cervical cancer screening because they were Hmong. When discussing health care more broadly, however, some participants described differential (e.g., disrespectful or rude) treatment. Such experiences led to feelings such as anger and sadness and affected behavior, including willingness to seek care and choice of provider. Medical mistrust and perceived discrimination were not major barriers to breast and cervical cancer screening in this study. Additional studies are needed to assess whether our findings reflect the experiences of other Hmong."

Media coverage has been extensive, but it is not obvious what messages the public took from this personal health story. We conducted a survey with a representative national online panel of 2,572 adults. Participants described their awareness and identified information sources for the Angelina Jolie news story. They also reported their understanding, reactions, perceptions, and subsequent activities related to the story. We asked questions pertaining to personal and societal breast cancer risk and hypothetical questions regarding preventive surgery if the respondent or a family member were in the same position as Ms Jolie. Demographic information was collected, as was family risk for breast and ovarian cancer, and a gauge of numeracy. While three of four Americans were aware of Angelina Jolie's double mastectomy, fewer than 10% of respondents had the information necessary to accurately interpret Ms Jolie's risk of developing cancer relative to a woman unaffected by the BRCA gene mutation. Awareness of the Angelina Jolie story was not associated with improved understanding. While celebrities can bring heightened awareness to health issues, there is a need for these messages to be accompanied by more purposeful communication efforts to assist the public in understanding and using the complex diagnostic and treatment information that these stories convey."

The Witness Project is a theory-based intervention designed to provide culturally sensitive messages, from African American breast cancer survivors, in churches and community organizations. These messages emphasize the importance of early detection to improve survival. Intervention research in eastern Arkansas with 204 African American women demonstrated a significant increase in the practice of breast self-examination (p < 0.001) and mammography (p < 0.001) after participation in the Witness Project. There was no significant difference between the pre- and postintervention scores for scaled items for the health-belief model and locus of control. Results demonstrate that culturally appropriate cancer education programs are able to change behavior by meeting the beliefs of participants rather than attempting to change their beliefs."

In Egypt women's breast cancer had the highest frequency. The present study was conducted to study the association between breast cancer and some reproductive factors as well as to find out (if possible) predictors for occurrence of breast cancer. A hospital based case control study was carried out in Alexandria Main University Hospital where, 129 histopathologically confirmed incident primary breast cancer cases were included. An equal number of a control group matched by age were selected from the visitors of the same hospital. Data related to women's reproductive period were collected from both cases and controls. The results revealed that there was no statistically significant difference between cases and controls as regards menopausal status, menstruation span, number of births, spontaneous and induced abortion, twin birth, breast feeding and use of oral contraceptives. There was an increasing risk of breast cancer, with the presence of positive family history of breast cancer decreasing age at menarche, increasing age at first full-term pregnancy, widening of the interval between menarche and first full-term pregnancy, increasing age at last full-term pregnancy and shortening of the interval since last birth. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that positive family history of breast cancer, young age at menarche, late age at last full-term pregnancy and wide inter-birth interval were significant predictors for occurrence of breast cancer. The results of the study pinpoint that conduction of public health education programmes focusing on the modifiable risk factors are required."

Both videos consisted of a combination of moving text, novel images, animations, and youth-friendly music. A brief questionnaire was used to gather feedback on two videos using a convenience sample of 135 youth in British Columbia, Canada. The overall positive responses by girls and boys to their respective videos and their reported interest in sharing these videos via social networking suggests that this approach holds potential for other types of health promotion messaging targeting youth. The videos offer a promising messaging strategy for raising awareness about tobacco exposure as a modifiable risk factor for breast cancer. Tailored, gender-specific messages for use on social media hold the potential for cost-effective, health promotion and cancer prevention initiatives targeting youth."

Few studies have assessed cancer risk beyond 10-15 years after breast implantation. Reasons for the consistently reported deficit of breast cancer among women with breast implants remain unclear.,"The available epidemiologic evidence does not support a carcinogenic effect of silicone breast implants on breast or other cancers. Data on cancer risk other than breast cancer are limited and few studies have assessed cancer risk beyond 10-15 years after breast implantation. We extended follow-up of our earlier cohort study of Danish women with cosmetic breast implants by 7 years, yielding 30 years of follow-up for women with longest implant duration. The study population consisted of women who underwent cosmetic breast implant surgery at private clinics of plastic surgery (n = 1,653) or public hospitals (n = 1,110), and a control group of women who attended private clinics for other plastic surgery (n = 1,736), between 1973-95. Cancer incidence through 2002 was ascertained using the Danish Cancer Registry. Risk evaluation was based on computation of standardized incidence ratios (SIR) and Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for age, calendar period and reproductive history. We observed 163 cancers among women with breast implants compared to 136.7 expected based on general population rates (SIR = 1.2; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.0-1.4), during a mean follow-up period of 14.4 years (range = 0-30 years). Women with breast implants experienced a reduced risk of breast cancer (SIR = 0.7; 95% CI = 0.5-1.0), and an increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer (SIR = 2.1; 95% CI = 1.5-2.7). Stratification by age at implantation, calendar year at implantation and time since implantation showed no clear trends, however, the statistical precision was limited in these analyses. When excluding non-melanoma skin cancer, the SIR for cancer overall was 1.0 (95% CI = 0.8-1.2). With respect to other site-specific cancers, no significantly increased or decreased SIR were observed. Similar results were found when directly comparing women who had implants at private clinics with women who attended private clinics for other plastic surgery, with rate ratios for cancer overall, breast cancer and non-melanoma skin cancer of 1.1 (95% CI = 0.8-1.6), 0.7 (95% CI = 0.4-1.3) and 1.5 (95% CI = 0.8-2.7), respectively. In conclusion, our study lends further support to the accumulating evidence that silicone breast implants are not carcinogenic. Reasons for the consistently reported deficit of breast cancer among women with breast implants remain unclear, whereas increased exposure to sunlight may explain the excess occurrence of non-melanoma skin cancer. We found no indication of delayed diagnosis of breast cancer due to the presence of breast implants."

Health promotion behaviors often are taught in high school, but little research has been performed on teaching breast health in a high school setting. Therefore, this descriptive study aimed to identify the beliefs, knowledge, and practices of breast self-examination in adolescent girls. A pre- and posttest design was used to determine whether a teaching program would change beliefs, knowledge, and practices of breast self-examination. The results of this study demonstrate that a one-time intervention can be successful in increasing breast self-examination practice and the knowledge of breast self-examination and cancer in adolescents. Before the intervention, approximately 66% of students said they never examined their breasts, and only 3% performed breast self-examination monthly. In 1 month after teaching, these percentages changed appreciably, with 32% of students reporting that they never practiced breast self-examination and 23% reporting that they practiced breast self-examination monthly."

The Ductal Lavage (DL) procedure offers a minimally invasive method to obtain breast epithelial cells from the ductal system for cytopathologic analysis. Several studies with long-term follow-up have shown that women with atypical hyperplasia have an elevated risk of developing breast cancer. The objective of the proposed trial is to assess the efficacy and safety of a daily administration of nimesulide or simvastatin in women at higher risk for breast cancer, focused particularly on hormone non-responsive tumor risk. The primary endpoint is the change in prevalence of atypical cells and cell proliferation (measured by Ki67) in DL or fine needle aspirate samples, after 12 months of treatment and 12 months after treatment cessation. METHODS-DESIGN: From 2005 to 2011, 150 women with a history of estrogen receptor negative ductal intraepithelial neoplasia or lobular intraepithelial neoplasia or atypical hyperplasia, or unaffected subjects carrying a mutation of BRCA1 or with a probability of mutation >10% (according to BRCAPRO) were randomized to receive nimesulide 100mg/day versus simvastatin 20mg/day versus placebo for one year followed by a second year of follow-up. This is the first randomized placebo controlled trial to evaluate the role of DL to study surrogate endpoints biomarkers and the effects of these drugs on breast carcinogenesis. In 2007 the European Medicines Agency limited the use of systemic formulations of nimesulide to 15 days. According to the European Institute of Oncology Ethics Committee communication, we are now performing an even more careful monitoring of the study participants. Preliminary results showed that DL is a feasible procedure, the treatment is well tolerated and the safety blood tests do not show any significant liver toxicity. There is an urgent need to confirm in the clinical setting the potential efficacy of other compounds in contrasting hormone non-responsive breast cancer. This paper is focused on the methodology and operational aspects of the clinical trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01500577)."

Examine the prevalence and trends of lifetime mammography and 2-year mammography compliance in Missouri by age, race, and education from 1987 to 1995 and make predictions for the years 2000 and 2010. We used data from the Missouri Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), 1987 to 1995, to estimate the prevalence of ever having had a mammogram and compliance with mammography screening guidelines within two years by race, age, and education status among Missouri women over age 18. Using linear models, we regressed breast cancer screening prevalence estimates on time to obtain trends and predictions. Overall, African-American women were more likely to have had a lifetime mammogram than white women. However, we found a steady increase in the prevalence of ever having had a mammogram for all groups of women defined by age and education status, except among African Americans. Increase in the prevalence of ever having had a mammogram was much higher in women age 50 and older and slightly higher among women with a high school education or less. The average prevalence of 2-year mammography screening compliance was about 60% for all groups, a rate which did not significantly change between 1987 and 1995. By the year 2000, white women will have mammography rates equal to or higher than African-American women, and the majority of all women age 50 and older (98.3% to 100%) will have had a lifetime mammogram. Missouri target populations are predicted to attain Year 2000 National Health Objectives concerning lifetime mammography. Current efforts should be continued in order to maintain levels of mammography, particularly among African-American women."
Perceptions about breast cancer among college students: implications for nursing education.,"Powe, Underwood, Canales, Finnie",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16021802/,Little attention is given to psychosocial issues in nursing texts. Few nursing students reported obtaining information on common perceptions about cancer from their coursework. More research is needed to understand how the nursing students' perceptions about breast cancer influence their ability to provide patient care across the cancer continuum.,"Nurses are in a key position to enhance knowledge, correct misperceptions, and allay fears related to breast cancer. However, little attention is given to these psychosocial issues in nursing texts, and the extent to which they are covered within nursing curricula is unclear. This study, guided by the Powe Fatalism Model, compared perceptions about breast cancer and sources of cancer information among a random sample (n = 158) of nursing and non-nursing female students (mean age = 24). Data were collected using a Breast Cancer Perceptions and Knowledge Survey and a demographic questionnaire. A significant number of myths and misperceptions related to breast cancer were prevalent within both groups. Few nursing students reported obtaining information on common perceptions about cancer from their coursework. More research is needed to understand how the nursing students' perceptions about breast cancer influence their ability to provide patient care across the cancer continuum."
Influence of diet on nipple aspirate fluid production and estrogen levels.,"Morimoto, Conroy, Pagano, Franke, Stanczyk, Maskarinec","Journal Article, Randomized Controlled Trial, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21986640/,NAF is thought to provide a more direct insight into hormonal influences on breast tissue than serum.

Isoflavonoid and soy consumption suggested inverse associations.,"One possible mechanism how nutritional factors may affect breast cancer risk is through an influence on estrogen levels. Nipple aspirate fluid (NAF) is thought to provide a more direct insight into hormonal influences on breast tissue than serum. The ability to produce NAF may be an indicator of breast cancer risk. The current analysis was conducted as part of a soy trial in 92 premenopausal women and evaluated the relation of usual dietary intake with NAF volume and the most predominant steroidal estrogens in NAF and serum at baseline. Estradiol (E(2)) and estrone sulfate (E(1)S) were assessed in NAF and E(2), estrone (E(1)), and E(1)S, in serum using highly sensitive radioimmunoassays. The statistical analysis applied multivariate, log-linear regression models. Intake of saturated fat and cheese (p = 0.06 for both) indicated a positive trend with NAF volume whereas isoflavonoid and soy consumption suggested inverse associations (p = 0.01 and p = 0.08). For estrogens in NAF, total fat and monounsaturated fat intake was positively associated with E(2) (p = 0.05 and p = 0.02) and in serum, alcohol intake was associated with higher E(1)S levels (p = 0.02). These findings suggest a weak influence of dietary composition on NAF production and estrogen levels in serum and NAF."

Using anonymous questionnaires, data were collected from 10,810 female undergraduate university students aged 16- 30 (mean age 20.7, SD=2.9) from 25 universities in 24 countries across Asia, Africa and the Americas. Overall, 50.4% of the female students indicated that they knew how to conduct BSE. Among all women, 59.3% had never practiced BSE in the past 12 months, 21.3% 1-2 times, 10.3% 3-10 times, and 9.1% monthly. The proportion of monthly BSE was above 20% in Nigeria and Laos and below 2% in Bangladesh, India, Singapore, Russia, and South Africa. Logistic regression found that BSE importance or positive attitude was highly associated with BSE practice. BSE practices were found to be inadequate and efforts should be made to develop programmes that can increase knowledge related to breast cancer as well as the practice of breast self-examination."

We examined associations between race/ethnicity and Pap testing within three years or mammography within two years. Reactions to race-based treatment did not impact the odds of black women receiving Pap tests or mammograms.,"Racial and ethnic disparities in breast and cervical cancer mortality persist despite effective screening methods. We examined associations between race/ethnicity and Pap testing within three years or mammography within two years, controlling for a composite reactions-to-race-based-treatment variable created using data from the 2002 and 2004 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Reactions to Race module, which assessed respondents experiences based on one's race. We calculated prevalence of Pap testing (for women aged > or = 18) and mammography (for women aged > or = 40) by race, and fit logistic regression models to estimate the strength of association of reactions to race-based treatment with screening and race--before and after controlling for demographics, socioeconomic status, health status, smoking and healthcare access. In the reduced model, black women were more likely (2.03: 95% CI: 1.55-2.65) to be screened for cervical cancer than whites. Reactions to race-based treatment did not impact the odds of black women receiving Pap tests or mammograms. Given current racial and ethnic disparities in breast and cervical cancer mortality, we suggest that more attention needs to be focused on follow-up of abnormal results and state-of-the art treatment for black and Hispanic women."

We investigated whether physical activity is associated with reduced incidence of premenopausal breast cancer, and, if so, what age period and intensity of activity are critical. A total of 64,777 premenopausal women in the Nurses' Health Study II reported, starting on the 1997 questionnaire, their leisure-time physical activity from age 12 to current age. Cox regression models were used to examine the relationship between physical activity, categorized by age period (adolescence, adulthood, and lifetime) and intensity (strenuous, moderate, walking, and total), and risk of invasive premenopausal breast cancer. During 6 years of follow-up, 550 premenopausal women developed breast cancer. The strongest associations were for total leisure-time activity during participants' lifetimes rather than for any one intensity or age period. Active women engaging in 39 or more metabolic equivalent hours per week (MET-h/wk) of total activity on average during their lifetime had a 23% lower risk of premenopausal breast cancer (relative risk = 0.77; 95% confidence interval = 0.64 to 0.93) than women reporting less activity. This level of total activity is equivalent to 3.25 h/wk of running or 13 h/wk of walking. The age-adjusted incidence rates of breast cancer for the highest (> or = 54 MET-h/wk) and lowest (< 21 MET-h/wk) total lifetime physical activity categories were 136 and 194 per 100 000 person-years, respectively. High levels of physical activity during ages 12-22 years contributed most strongly to the association. Leisure-time physical activity was associated with a reduced risk for premenopausal breast cancer in this cohort. Premenopausal women regularly engaging in high amounts of physical activity during both adolescence and adulthood may derive the most benefit."

This study employed ethnographic methods to explore breast cancer-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors among Latinas, Anglo women, and physicians, tested the generalizability of the findings in a telephone survey of randomly selected women, and used the results to design a culturally sensitive breast cancer control intervention in Orange County, Calif. Respondents for the ethnographic interviews included 28 Salvadoran immigrants, 39 Mexican immigrants, 27 Chicanas (U.S.-born Latinas of Mexican heritage), 27 Anglo women, and 30 physicians selected through organization-based network sampling. Latinas had very different beliefs about risk factors for breast cancer and held more fatalistic attitudes about the disease. For example, they believed that trauma to the breast was among the most important risk factors. Results of a telephone survey of 1225 randomly selected women (269 U.S.-born Latinas, 425 Mexican immigrants, 109 other Latina immigrants, and 422 Anglo women) generally confirmed the dissimilar beliefs among Latinas and Anglo women. The findings influenced our decision to design and pilot-test a breast cancer control intervention based on Bandura's self-efficacy theory and Freire's empowerment pedagogy. The methodology and findings of this study have important implications for future cancer control research and interventions."

The observed low survival rates are related to late stage at presentation despite the availability of breast self examination (BSE) as a reliable screening method for early detection. This cross-sectional study was designed to determine the knowledge, attitude and practice towards BSE amongst women aged 15 years old and above. Systemic random sampling was applied and information gathered through guided interview by using a structured questionnaire. A total of 86 respondents were recruited, with a mean age of 40.5 years (SD: 15.51), more than 80% having a secondary or tertiary level of education. The total score was 16.9 (total mean percent: 60.4%) for knowledge, 37.1 (77.3%) for attitude and 9.56 (34.1%) for practice. The proportions of respondents with good score for knowledge, attitude and practice were 38.4%, 73.3% and 7.0%, respectively. Not knowing the correct method of BSE, lack of knowledge on cancer signs and lack of motivational support from parents, spouse or friends appeared to be related with the poor practices. Enhancement of breast cancer awareness and focusing on recognized barriers by health care professionals with the involvement of spouses, family and community would have a substantial beneficial impact on BSE practice."

These suggest a westernization effect, and the possible existence of two distinct disease entities--pre- and postmenopausal. Known risk factors may be defined in a number of ways. From a preventive standpoint, a practical classification is suggested whereby risk factors are grouped as preventable, modifiable, unapproachable or spurious. The only risk factors which seem definite at present are estrogen exposure, family history and radiation, with the possible contribution of benign breast disease, replacement hormones, and diet. The only preventable factors are radiation and possibly long-term hormonal replacement, but their contribution to the disease indicence in the population is minimal. Two theoretically modifiable factors are diet and age at first birth, but the latter cannot be easily influenced, and the effect of dietary modification is still unsubstantiated."

Prevalence of breast carcinoma is high in Egypt and the cases of breast cancer constitute 29% of cancer cases treated at the national cancer institute. This study aimed at exploring the level of knowledge of Egyptian females of breast cancer and its risk factors. An interview questionnaire with 22 questions about breast cancer was developed. This questionnaire was previously published as a part of the German multicentre DACH study). A total of 600 female subjects that attended primary health care centres were enrolled in our study. The majority were located in Cairo with the mean age of 40.5 +/- 11.0. Most of our studied sample (94%) has heard about breast cancer as a disease. TV and radio were the main sources of knowledge about the disease (60%). The level of knowledge about breast cancer was limited in 80% of the subjects. Younger age subjects had a higher level of knowledge about breast cancer compared to older subjects with no significant difference statistically. The grade of knowledge about breast cancer was higher among highly educated subjects compared to less educated subjects with significant difference statistically. The highest known risk factors of breast cancer were exposure to X ray (79.5%), hormonal therapy (75.7%) and previous breast cancer disease (70.8%).

However, recent research indicates that the vast majority of U.S. women are unaware that alcohol use is a risk factor for breast cancer. There is limited information about the sociodemographic characteristics and alcohol use correlates of awareness of the alcohol use and breast cancer link, and this is critically important for health promotion and intervention efforts. In this study, we assessed prevalence of the awareness of alcohol use as a risk factor for breast cancer among U.S. women and examined sociodemographic and alcohol use correlates of awareness of this link. We conducted a 20-minute online cross-sectional survey, called the ABLE (Alcohol and Breast Cancer Link Awareness) survey, among U.S. women aged 18 years and older (N = 5,027) in the fall of 2021. Survey questions assessed awareness that alcohol use increases breast cancer risk (yes, no, don't know/unsure); past-year alcohol use and harmful drinking via the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT); and family, health, and sociodemographic characteristics. We conducted multivariate multinomial regression analysis to identify correlates of awareness that alcohol use increases breast cancer risk. Overall, 24.4% reported that alcohol use increased breast cancer risk, 40.2% reported they were unsure, and 35.4% reported that there was no link between alcohol use and breast cancer. In adjusted analysis, awareness of alcohol use as a breast cancer risk factor, compared to not being aware or unsure, was associated with being younger (18-25 years old), having a college degree, and having alcohol use disorder symptoms. Black women were less likely than white women to report awareness of the alcohol use and breast cancer link. Overall, only a quarter of U.S. women were aware that alcohol use increases breast cancer risk, although 40% expressed uncertainty. Differences in awareness by age, level of education, race and ethnicity and level of alcohol use offer opportunities for tailored prevention interventions, while the overall low level of awareness calls for widespread efforts to increase awareness of the breast cancer risk from alcohol use among U.S. women."

We examined whether caloric restriction imposed as a consequence of the 1944-1945 Dutch famine reduced the risk of breast cancer in women participating in a Dutch breast cancer screening program. Between 1983 and 1986, approximately 15 000 women, aged 2 to 33 years during the 1944-1945 Dutch famine, responded to a questionnaire about their famine experience. A famine exposure score, graded as absent, moderate, or severe exposure, was derived from answers regarding hunger, cold, and weight loss. During follow-up until January 2000, 585 women with incident breast cancer were identified by the regional cancer registry. The relationship between famine exposure and breast cancer risk was assessed by weighted Cox regression models, in which person-years lived for the entire cohort was extrapolated from data from a random sample of 15% of the cohort. Women who were severely exposed to the famine had a statistically significantly higher risk of breast cancer (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.09 to 2.01) than women who were not exposed. Women who were moderately exposed to the famine had a 13% increased risk of breast cancer (HR = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.92 to 1.38; P(trend) = 0.016). The association between famine exposure and breast cancer risk was stronger for women who were exposed between the ages of 2 and 9 years (severely exposed versus unexposed: HR = 2.01, 95% CI = 0.92 to 4.41) than for women who were exposed at older ages. The risk of breast cancer was increased in women who were severely exposed to a short but severe famine decades earlier. This result is compatible with data from the few animal studies investigating effects of short-term, transient caloric restriction."

Furthermore, insulin and markers of insulin resistance, such as abdominal obesity, high blood glucose, high serum testosterone and metabolic syndrome, may affect both BC incidence and prognosis. We hypothesized that all these factors might be relevant also for hereditary BC, due to a deleterious mutation of BRCA genes. Epidemiological observation suggested that weight, energy intake (usually associated with higher bio-availability of growth factors) and physical activity may be relevant in BRCA mutation carriers. Mechanistic studies hypothesized a functional interaction between BRCA genes and the IGF-I system. We have provided some evidence that high serum levels of IGF-I are associated with a significantly increased penetrance. We are recruiting a larger cohort of BRCA mutation carriers in order to test potential modulators of penetrance and prognosis. Within this cohort, we have planned a randomized controlled trial to test whether moderate calorie and protein restriction, together with physical activity, decrease IGF-I. Eligible study subjects are women with or without BC, aged 18-70, with a proven deleterious BRCA mutation, and without metastases. All the women will receive recommendations for the dietary prevention of cancer. The women will be then randomized into an active life-style intervention group and into a control group that will receive only the baseline recommendations. We expect to significantly reduce IGF-I in the intervention group. This trial and the subsequent cohort follow-up might open up primary prevention options for genetic BC."

Australia has three population screening programs: the National Cervical Screening Program (NCSP), BreastScreen Australia and the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP). We reviewed the history and development of the three programs. NCSP: Women have a Pap smear every 2 years from age 18-20, or 2 years after first becoming sexually active, until age 69. Since introduction of the NCSP, the cervical cancer incidence has halved, with an approximate 60% decrease in mortality. The screening participation rate approximates 57%, but is lower for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, women in remote areas, and women with lower socio-economic status. The National HPV (human papillomavirus) Vaccination Program, introduced in 2007, is expected to reduce the incidence of cervical cancer by a further 70% and has already reduced the incidence of high-grade lesions in girls. In 2017, testing for HPV every 5 years starting at age 25 will replace the Pap smear as the principal screening test. BreastScreen Australia: This program targets women aged 50-74. Over 20 years, mortality from breast cancer has decreased by 32% in response to screening and treatment advances. The participation rate is 56%. The major adverse impact of breast screening is overdiagnosis, estimated in Australia to be as low as 8% of detected cancers, but with estimates of up to 30% from some research. Women should be made aware of both the potential benefits and harms from screening. Genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in high-risk women leads to earlier screening. The NBCSP uses immunochemical faecal occult blood test (iFOBT) kits on stool samples to detect bleeding from the bowel. When rollout is complete in 2020, test kits will be sent every 2 years to people aged 50-74. People who test positive are followed up with a colonoscopy. The participation rate is currently 37%. The positivity rate is 7%, and stage 1 bowel cancer presentations have tripled since the program began. Research needs to focus on reducing mortality through increased screening participation and, in the future, obtaining guidance for customised screening from genomic testing."
[Reduction of missing report rate of breast cancer in clinical breast examination].,"Wang, Zhang, Sun, Wang, Wang, Sha-Ren","English Abstract, Journal Article",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21223816/,"The missing report rate of breast cancer was 3.7% in CBE, 17% in ultrasonography and 19.4% in mammography. Small breast nodules, marginal foci of mammary gland, axillary fossa and mammary areola had the tendency to be missed.","To explore the methods of reducing the missing report rate of breast cancer in clinical breast examination (CBE). The investigators analyzed the data of abnormal breast physical examination in 2181 females and the missing report rate of breast cancer in various kinds of examination methods. Interrogation and inspection reduced the missing report rate by 5% in all cases. And the missing report rate was lowered from 0.9% to 0.4% by multi-position joint palpation among 2839 breast foci in abnormal physical examination. Small breast nodules, marginal foci of mammary gland, axillary fossa and mammary areola had the tendency to be missed. Focal thickening of mammary gland was also easily missed. Compared with the control group, the abnormality of interrogation and inspection in the breast cancer group were statistically significant in the operation group (Ï‡(2) = 9.770, P = 0.002). The missing report rate of breast cancer was 3.7% in CBE, 17% in ultrasonography and 19.4% in mammography. The methods of reducing the missing report rate of breast cancer in clinical breast examination are as follows: valuing the importance of interrogation and inspection; using different palpation methods on the basis of different breast morphologic features; paying more attention to the marginal foci of mammary gland, axillary fossa and mammary areola; examining closely the focal thickening of mammary gland. Scirrhosity is inadvisable as an independent predictor for malignant tumor. A clinician should avoid an excessive dependence on palpation and instruments."
Complications following bilateral prophylactic mastectomy.,"Barton, West, Liu, Harris, Rolnick, Elmore, Herrinton, Greene, Nekhlyudov, Fletcher, Geiger","Journal Article, Multicenter Study, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16287887/,Bilateral prophylactic mastectomy significantly decreases breast cancer risk.

We describe the frequency and type of complications in women who underwent bilateral prophylactic mastectomy in a multisite community-based cohort. Women aged 18-80 years undergoing bilateral prophylactic mastectomy without a personal history of breast cancer at one of six health plans were eligible. We identified women from automated data sources, then reviewed hospital data, ambulatory notes, and other chart elements to confirm eligibility and obtain all charted information about complications and surgeries performed after prophylactic mastectomy, including reconstructive procedures. Reconstructions were characterized by type (implant vs. tissue graft). Complications were noted for a 1-year period after any surgical procedure. We identified 269 women with prophylactic mastectomy who were followed for a mean of 7.4 years. Their mean age was 44.9 years. Nearly 80% undertook reconstruction, most with prosthetic implants. One or more complications occurred in 64%. The most common complications were pain (35% of women), infection (17%), and seroma (17%). Women with no reconstruction had fewer complications (mean of .93) than women who had implant (2.0) or tissue graft (2.4) reconstruction procedures (differences from no reconstruction: 1.07 [95% confidence interval = 0.36 to 1.77] and 1.50 [95% confidence interval = 0.44 to 2.56] respectively). Delay of reconstruction after mastectomy was associated with a borderline-significant higher risk of complications (80.6%) compared to simultaneous reconstruction (64.0%, P = .055). We found that almost two-thirds of women undergoing bilateral prophylactic mastectomy had at least one complication following surgery. Further work should be done to minimize and to understand the effect of complications of bilateral prophylactic mastectomy."

Forty-five interviews were conducted in Arkansas, New York City and Buffalo, New York. Thematic data analyses were conducted to understand influential factors following from the intervention. Four major themes emerged from the interviews: Social Capital, Screening Utilization, Health Care Provider (HCP) Communication and Social Networks. Social Capital included resources, access or screening knowledge women had prior to participation in the program and new resources and contacts gained through the program that influenced care seeking. Screening Utilization factors included past health experiences and participation in the program. HCP Communication included perceptions of quality of care and communication issues with HCPs that positively and negatively impacted screening. Social Networks included women's networks regarding emotional support, encouragement to discuss health issues, overall family network and how these may influence health-seeking behaviors. These findings suggest that participating in group-based health outreach programs empowered women by increasing their knowledge and awareness about the health care system and enabled them, with the tools provided, to become proactive in their health care-seeking behaviors."

We analyzed data from a random sample household survey of African-American women in a Florida community (n = 281) and three age-homogenous focus groups from the same population. Two thirds of the random sample and all of the focus group participants had less than a high school education and household incomes below $10,000. Even though both samples of women were likely to have a physician they see regularly, most had never had a mammogram and could not accurately describe more than two major techniques for BSE. Knowing guidelines for mammography, CBE, and BSE (predisposing factors), believing their screening behavior mattered to at least some family members (reinforcing factor), seeing a physician for health care and advice, and having been taught BSE in a physician's office (enabling factors) predicted one form of breast screening behavior or another in multivariate logistic regression analyses. In addition, knowing mammography and BSE guidelines and having been taught BSE in a physician's office were significant predictors of breast-screening behavior for both low- and moderate-income women. Focus-group participants unanimously reported a willingness to listen to physician instructions regarding breast screening and to receive a mammogram if their physician recommended one. Both survey and focus group results emphasize the particular importance of physicians in promoting breast screening among African-American women regardless of their income."

We hypothesized that a high percentage of women presenting for care to an inner-city medical walk-in clinic would report inadequate screening for breast and cervical cancer by current standards, accept same-day screening, and comply with recommended follow-up. To determine how many women presenting to our medical Walk-In Clinic were inadequately screened for breast and cervical cancer and how many were willing to undergo same-day screening, we surveyed all women at this site over a three month period. We then implemented a one-year, same-day screening program and contacted patients with abnormal screening results by letter or phone to encourage follow up. We tracked patients to assess compliance with follow-up. Of the 2,363 women in the initial survey, 1,230 (52%) reported inadequate screening, of whom 55% reported interest in same-day screening. Over the one year screening period, we screened 403 women for breast and/or cervical cancer. Of the 48 women with abnormal Pap tests, compliance with initial Gynecology Clinic follow-up was 56%. Compliance was 49% with mammography appointments, and 77% for follow-up to Breast Clinic for clinical and/or mammographic abnormalities. These compliance rates compare favorably to those for screening performed in more traditional settings. Our results support the establishment of cancer screening programs in nontraditional settings such as walk-in clinics and emergency departments to target patients who are at high risk for remaining unscreened."

Participants were 56 women diagnosed with breast cancer and enrolled in a randomized feasibility study for a trial examining the effect of a diet high in vegetables and fruits on the risk of breast cancer recurrence. Independent t test analysis revealed that the intervention group had significantly higher vegetable and fruit servings and fiber at 12 mo and significantly higher vegetable servings at 36 mo compared with the control group (P < 0.05). Energy intake from fat was significantly lower in the intervention group at 12 and 36 mo. The intervention group had significantly higher consumption of beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, lutein and beta-cryptoxanthin at 12 mo (P < 0.05). beta-Carotene, alpha-carotene and lutein intakes also were significantly higher at 36 mo (P < 0.05). At 36 mo, the intervention group had significantly higher plasma concentrations of alpha-carotene and beta-carotene compared with the control group. Repeated-measures ANOVA revealed that the intervention group had significantly increased (P < 0.05 with Bonferroni correction) plasma beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, lutein and lycopene concentrations at 12 and 36 mo compared with baseline. Baseline carotenoid concentrations were significantly inversely predictive (P < 0.05) of plasma carotenoid change. In addition, change in body mass index (BMI) and plasma cholesterol concentrations were predictive of plasma carotenoid change from baseline to 3 y. Results of this study demonstrate that change in plasma carotenoid concentrations is associated with change in BMI, change in plasma cholesterol and baseline carotenoid concentrations. Plasma carotenoid response can be an indicator of long-term high vegetable intake for women at risk of breast cancer recurrence."

We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database to identify patients with ILC diagnosed between 1998 and 2010. Survival differences were compared between unilateral mastectomy and CPM. Propensity score matching and risk-stratified subgroup analyses were conducted to reduce selection bias. Among 10 226 patients with ILC, 21.8% women underwent CPM, and the rate of CPM nearly tripled over a 13-year period. Kaplan-Meier curves and hazard ratio (HR) of non-breast cancer-specific survival (non-BCSS) in multivariate analysis reflected a pre-existing selection bias in the present cohort. A Cox proportional hazard model confirmed that patients who received CPM had significantly better BCSS and overall survival (OS) in the prematching population (BCSS: HR = 0.90; OS: HR = 0.93). However, the survival improvement could not be achieved in the postmatching cohort. None of the defined subgroups had OS benefits when CPM was performed. CPM offers no survival advantage to patients with ILC. The role of CPM among ILC women should be further investigated by incorporating more objective factors."

Experimental observations suggest that human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a major hormone of pregnancy, could play a role in this association. A case-control study (242 cases and 450 controls) nested within the Northern Sweden Maternity Cohort included women who had donated a blood sample during the first trimester of a first full-term pregnancy.

The association diverged according to age at diagnosis: risk was reduced after age 40 (upper tertile OR, 0.60; CI, 0.39-0.91) and seemed to increase before age 40 (upper tertile OR, 1.78; CI, 0.72-4.38). Risk was reduced among those diagnosed 10 years or longer after blood draw (upper tertile OR, 0.60; CI, 0.40-0.90), but not so among those diagnosed within 10 years (upper tertile OR, 4.33; CI, 0.86-21.7). These observations suggest that the association between pregnancy hCG and subsequent maternal risk of breast cancer is modified by age at diagnosis. Although the hormone seems to be a determinant of the reduced risk around or after age 50, it might not confer protection against, or it could even increase the risk of, cancers diagnosed in the years immediately following pregnancy."

Correlations were used to estimate the association between feelings of anxiety and compliance. We found that women attending programs targeting those at familial risk for breast cancer suffer from significant symptoms of general anxiety. General anxiety was found to be related to anxiety regarding specific screening practices but not to women's perceived vulnerability to cancer In general, neither general nor screening-specific anxiety were found to be related to patients 'compliance with screening practices; however, significant associations were found between patient's feelings of anxiety regarding BSEs and their actual performing them. BSE appears to be the only procedure for which compliance is negatively associated with procedure-specific anxiety. We offer possible explanations for this relation and discuss the possible psychological impact that recommendations regarding BSEs may have on highly anxious at-risk women."

All women aged 51-60 invited over an eight-week period in 1997 to a pilot breast cancer screening in Norway were also invited to participate in this study (n = 10,513). Information was collected by questionnaire about intensity and duration of physical activity from the age of ten up to the present, in five-year intervals. The activity was converted to scores of Metabolic Equivalent Task (MET). 74% og those invited attended the screening; 76% og those attending also took part in this study. A total of 2,300 of women gave adequate information about physical activity; only 12 of them had breast cancer. Those with cancer reported less physical activity compared to the controls. Physical activity corresponding to > or = 15 MET/week at age 10-24 reduced the risk of breast cancer at age 51-60 significantly (OR = 0.2; CI 0.0-0.9). The small number of breast cancer cases limits the validity of the results, though the data indicate that physical activity of > or = 15 MET/week at age 10-24 may reduce the risk of breast cancer at age 51-60."
Testicular versus breast and colorectal cancer screening: early detection practices of primary care physicians.,"Misener, Fuller","Comparative Study, Journal Article",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7663550/,Testicular cancer is the most common solid tumor among men 20 to 34 years old. It accounts for one of every seven deaths in late adolescent and young adult men. A majority of men in the most vulnerable ages are unaware of their risk for testicular cancer.,"Testicular cancer is the most common solid tumor among men 20 to 34 years old, and it accounts for one of every seven deaths in late adolescent and young adult men. However, studies during the past 20 years continue to show that a majority of men in the most vulnerable ages are unaware of their risk for testicular cancer, deny having had testicular examinations as a part of their routine physical assessments, and lack knowledge of testicular self-examination techniques. This descriptive study used a mailed questionnaire and evaluated self-reported testicular cancer detection behaviors among primary care physicians (N = 116). Breast exams and colorectal screening were included for masking and comparative purposes. Forty-nine percent of the physicians reported routinely performing age-appropriate testicular exams on patients, in contrast to performing breast (83%) and colorectal exams (68%). Instructing male patients to perform testicular self-examination was reported as a routine procedure by 29%, and breast exams were taught routinely by 86% of the physicians. Providing an opportunity for patients to give a return demonstration of the technique was reported 16% of the time for breast self-examination and 4% of the time for testicular self-examination. Teaching patients to do appropriate self-examinations can enhance the provider-client partnership in the provision of healthcare. When providers do not teach the patient to perform self-examinations, a valuable opportunity is missed."
Iranian women's attitude toward prophylactic mastectomy for breast cancer.,"Majidzadeh-A, Farahmand, Zare, Esmaeili, Salehi, Habibi",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27461674/,Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide. Science has proved that some breast cancer genes are inherited from parents. It is generally believed that the probability of cancer diagnosis in carriers of those genes is considerably higher than the normal population.,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide. Science has already proved that some breast cancer genes are inherited from parents. It is generally believed that the probability of cancer diagnosis in carriers of those genes is considerably higher than the normal population. It is in the same direction that modern medicine has introduced prophylactic mastectomy - one of the key preventive methods which is the focus of the present research. Nevertheless, whether women that have been diagnosed with breast cancer would take this approach depends on their local culture and their set of beliefs. In this regard, the present research was meant to evaluate the acceptability rate of prophylactic mastectomy among women in Iran after they are informed of the positive genetic test results. Six hundred and five healthy women, who had no history of breast cancer, were selected by nonprobability sampling method. A predesigned questionnaire was filled out by the interviewer. Results showed that about 15% of respondents were willing to pick the prophylactic mastectomy in case they are identified as carriers of breast cancer genes. Twenty-two percent of participants with positive family history was agreed with prophylactic mastectomy while in the negative family history group it was about 14%. Preventive mastectomy has a higher rate of acceptability among women who have had a family history of breast cancer. Therefore, it may be concluded that raising public awareness about the advantages of prophylactic mastectomy could help better address breast cancer in Iran."

This study determines the perceptions of health leaders regarding the development process for and the effectiveness of church health ministries, using the Precede/Proceed model. Ten health leaders from six medium-sized churches in a North Florida county participated in a 10-month breast health intervention. Data were collected using two methods. A brief questionnaire was administered that included items related to knowledge about breast health, perceptions of and processes for health ministry development, and perceptions of resources used during the intervention. In addition, a focus group was conducted with the health leaders, using a trained moderator, which included questions about their health behaviors prior to and after the project, biggest successes and challenges in establishing their health ministries, and plans for sustaining the health ministry after the project. Questionnaire data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and paired t-tests. Focus group data and open-ended questionnaire responses were transcribed and analyzed using code-based analytic procedures where data were organized into thinking units, categories, and then broader themes. Findings indicate that health leaders perceived that health ministry development focused on a series of steps, including: a) predisposing: health leaders background (personal characteristics, education/profession, health behaviors); b) enabling: support and participation from the pastor; and c) reinforcing: start-up processes (personal contact, public relations, materials and church member involvement) and outputs (activities and partnerships). This study demonstrates that health ministry development involves a sequential process that fits within a broad organizational framework for health behavior change."

Little is known about the feasibility of implementing these recommendations or how low-income women of color might respond to individualized risk assessment (IRA) performed by primary care providers (PCPs). Women recruited from a federally qualified health center were given the option to discuss BC risk status with their PCP. Comprehensive IRA was performed using a software tool designed for the primary care environment combining three assessment instruments and providing risk-adapted recommendations for screening, prevention, and genetic referral. Logistic regression models assessed factors associated with wanting to learn and discuss BC risk with PCP. Of 237 participants, only 12.7% (n = 30) did not want to discuss IRA results with their PCP. Factors associated with lower odds of wanting to learn results included having private insurance and reporting ever having had a mammogram. Factors associated with higher odds of wanting to learn results included older age (50 to 69 years) and increased BC worry. For all women wishing to learn results, IRA was successfully completed and delivered to the PCP immediately before the encounter for incorporation into the well-visit evaluation. Incorporation of US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations as part of routine primary care is feasible. Interest in IRA seems high among underserved women. This approach warrants further investigation as a strategy for addressing disparities in BC mortality."
Disparities in Risk Reduction Therapy Recommendations for Young Women With Lobular Carcinoma In-Situ.,"Bandera, Voci, Nelson, Stern, Barrak, Fischer, DiNome, Goldfarb",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32081572/,Endocrine therapy (ET) significantly reduces the risk of breast cancer development in high-risk patients with lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) The variables impacting recommendation and use of ET in young adults (YAs) is not well-studied. We examined the role of provider recommendation and patient acceptance for ET for YAs with LCIS.,"Endocrine therapy (ET) significantly reduces the risk of breast cancer development in high-risk patients diagnosed with lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS). However, the variables impacting recommendation and use of ET in young adults (YAs) is not well-studied. We examined the role of provider recommendation and patient acceptance for ET for YAs with LCIS. The National Cancer Database was queried for women aged < 40 years with primary LCIS between 2000 and 2012. Socioeconomic, demographic, and treatment variables were examined to determine their impact on ET provider recommendation and initial patient acceptance of risk-reducing therapy. Among 1650 YA patients with LCIS, only 749 (45.4%) were recommended ET. On multivariable analysis, women > 30 years of age were more likely recommended ET than women < 30 years (odds ratio [OR], 1.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-2.47), African Americans more than other ethnicities (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.1-2.0), and YAs treated in New England were more likely than those in the rest of the country (OR, 3.26; 95% CI, 2.0-5.2). Among YA women recommended ET, only 20.2% had a documented refusal. Only geography appeared to independently impact the likelihood of refusal, with YAs in the Southeastern-Central United States being most likely to refuse ET (OR, 5.4; 95% CI, 1.2-24.0). ET is underutilized for risk-reduction in YAs with LCIS. This underuse appears dependent on disparities in provider recommendation practices rather than non-acceptance of therapy. This may reflect regional practice patterns, community standards of care, or provider bias regarding the significance of LCIS as a risk factor for development of invasive cancer."

Intervention into carcinogenesis or alteration of the natural history of cancer requires a clear understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease and patient acceptance of interval surveillance. Because etiologic information and patient compliance are frequently limited, careful scrutiny of recommendations for cancer screening or prevention is essential. It is through taking detailed family, occupational, and carcinogen-exposure histories and doing a thorough physical examination that the primary care physician can best utilize information regarding the risk of cancer and the benefits of available methods of prevention and treatment."
"BRCA Genetic Testing and Receipt of Preventive Interventions Among Women Aged 18-64 Years with Employer-Sponsored Health Insurance in Nonmetropolitan and Metropolitan Areas - United States, 2009-2014.","Kolor, Chen, Grosse, Rodriguez, Green, Dotson, Bowen, Lynch, Khoury",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28880857/,"From 2009 to 2014, BRCA testing rates per 100,000 women aged 18-64 years with employer-sponsored health insurance increased 2.3 times (102.7 to 237.8) in metropolitan areas and 3.0 times (64.8 to 191.3) in nonmetropolitan areas.

These testing results can be used to select preventive interventions and guide treatment. Differences between nonmetropolitan and metropolitan populations in rates of BRCA testing and receipt of preventive interventions after testing have not previously been examined. 2009-2014. Medical claims data from Truven Health Analytics MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters databases were used to estimate rates of BRCA testing and receipt of preventive interventions after BRCA testing among women aged 18-64 years with employer-sponsored health insurance in metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas of the United States, both nationally and regionally. From 2009 to 2014, BRCA testing rates per 100,000 women aged 18-64 years with employer-sponsored health insurance increased 2.3 times (102.7 to 237.8) in metropolitan areas and 3.0 times (64.8 to 191.3) in nonmetropolitan areas. The relative difference in BRCA testing rates between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas decreased from 37% in 2009 (102.7 versus 64.8) to 20% in 2014 (237.8 versus 191.3). The relative difference in BRCA testing rates between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas decreased more over time in younger women than in older women and decreased in all regions except the West. Receipt of preventive services 90 days after BRCA testing in metropolitan versus nonmetropolitan areas throughout the period varied by service: the percentage of women who received a mastectomy was similar, the percentage of women who received magnetic resonance imaging of the breast was lower in nonmetropolitan areas (as low as 5.8% in 2014 to as high as 8.2% in 2011) than metropolitan areas (as low as 7.3% in 2014 to as high as 10.3% in 2011), and the percentage of women who received mammography was lower in nonmetropolitan areas in earlier years but was similar in later years. Possible explanations for the 47% decrease in the relative difference in BRCA testing rates over the study period include increased access to genetic services in nonmetropolitan areas and increased demand nationally as a result of publicity. The relative differences in metropolitan and nonmetropolitan BRCA testing rates were smaller among women at younger ages compared with older ages. Improved data sources and surveillance tools are needed to gather comprehensive data on BRCA testing in the United States, monitor adherence to evidence-based guidelines for BRCA testing, and assess receipt of preventive interventions for women with BRCA mutations. Programs can build on the recent decrease in geographic disparities in receipt of BRCA testing while simultaneously educating the public and health care providers about U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations and other clinical guidelines for BRCA testing and counseling."

There have been no published studies attempting to reduce DNA rates in breast clinics. We aimed to assess the impact of contacting patients prior to clinic attendance and Short Message Service (SMS) reminder on DNA rates in rapid access new patient breast clinics, evaluate 'Could Not Attend' (CNA) rate, and explore any correlation between age, sex, clinic days and sessions. Initially, DNAs at the rapid access new patient breast clinic between 01/04/2018 and 31/03/2019 at a district general hospital in the North-West of England was assessed (Cycle 1). Changes were introduced in terms of contacting patients prior to offering appointments, followed by SMS reminders nearer the clinic dates. Subsequently, DNA was reassessed between 01/10/2019 and 31/03/2020 (Cycle 2). Following implementation of changes, DNA rate reduced from 8.2 to 4.1% (p < 0.00001). CNA rates were 0.9% (Cycle 1) and 1.1% (Cycle 2) [p = 0.36]. Evening clinics had the lowest DNA rates throughout. DNA patients in cycle 2 were significantly older than those in cycle 1 (p = 0.002). Contacting patients prior to clinic appointments and sending SMS reminders helped reduce DNA rates significantly in rapid access new patient breast clinics. Scheduling clinic sessions with least DNA rates, such as evening clinics, should be contemplated. One should be cautious of mobile phone technology that conveys SMS, which can potentially disadvantage the older age group. This model could be considered across the board to improve DNA rates."

We aimed to quantify the degree of reduction in lifetime contralateral BC risk women required to justify CPM, and to explore demographic, disease and psychosocial predictors of preferences using Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) as a theoretical framework. Reasoning behind preferences was also examined. 388 women previously diagnosed with unilateral BC, of negative or unknown BRCA1/2 status, were recruited from an advocacy group research database. Two hypothetical risk trade-off scenarios were used to quantify the reduction in lifetime contralateral BC risk that women judged necessary to justify CPM, using a 5% and 20% baseline. Demographic, disease and PMT measures were assessed using a questionnaire. Most women required their risk to be more than halved from a 5% or 20% baseline to justify CPM. Polarised preferences were also common, with some women consistently accepting or refusing CPM independent of risk/benefit trade-offs. Preferences were associated with coping self-efficacy and having a prior CPM. Explanations for judging CPM worthwhile included reducing or eliminating contralateral BC risk, attaining breast symmetry and reducing worry. Risk-reduction preferences were highly variable. Decisive factors in women's preferences for CPM related to clinical, psychological and cosmetic outcomes, but not to demographic or disease characteristics."

The authors analyzed the changes in the general public's awareness of reconstructive options in breast cancer among 2 female population-matched cohorts aged 18 to 65 years (1000 participants in each cohort) before (March 2013; poll 1) and after (June 2013; poll 2) the announcement of Ms. Jolie's mastectomy in May 2013. There was an observed increase in public awareness: significantly more women from poll 2 were aware of reconstructive breast surgery being possible after breast cancer-related mastectomy, notably with regard to autologous tissue and single-stage reconstructions. Approximately 20% of the women in poll 2 (205 women) indicated that media coverage regarding Ms. Jolie affected their interest in breast cancer. A question that was exclusive to poll 2 revealed a preference for autologous (66.2%) versus implant-based (8.2%) reconstructions, with the remainder indicating no preference (25.6%). None of the stratification variables were found to be associated with the above findings. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first prospective study to demonstrate a statistically significant impact of a celebrity announcement on public awareness regarding breast cancer treatment. The results underscore the importance of a media-related impact for professionals in the health care sector, which can serve as a tipping point for raising awareness and improving knowledge concerning a specific disease among the general public."

The results from both institutions were similar and demonstrated that a low-fat dietary plan could be effectively conducted in private as well as academic settings with recruitment tailored to the community where the trial is being conducted. Reduction in dietary fat intake was maximal during the first three months of the dietary intervention and remained stable throughout 12 months of follow-up. Reductions in total calories, weight loss, and percent body fat were minimal. The nonintervention group experienced no major change in their diet. We conclude that it is feasible to recruit women who are at high risk for breast cancer into a dietary intervention trial and with sufficient dietary counseling and motivation on the part of participants, reduction in dietary fat intake can be achieved and maintained. More in-depth analyses of these data will be presented in subsequent reports."
A review of breast cancer awareness among women in India: Cancer literate or awareness deficit?,"Gupta, Shridhar, Dhillon","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26232859/,Breast cancer is the most common female cancer worldwide including India. We conducted a literature review to evaluate the awareness levels of risk factors for breast cancer among Indian women and health professionals. Literacy levels on risk factors did not improve over the 8-year period (2005-2013),"Breast cancer is the most common female cancer worldwide including India, where advanced stages at diagnosis, and rising incidence and mortality rates, make it essential to understand cancer literacy in women. We conducted a literature review to evaluate the awareness levels of risk factors for breast cancer among Indian women and health professionals. A structured literature search using combined keywords was undertaken on bibliographic databases including MEDLINE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL) and SCOPUS. Searches were restricted to research published in English language peer-reviewed journals through December, 2014 in India. A total of 7066 women aged 15-70 years showed varied levels of awareness on risk factors such as family history (13-58%), reproductive history (1-88%) and obesity (11-51%). Literacy levels on risk factors did not improve over the 8-year period (2005-2013). On average, nurses reported higher, though still varied, awareness levels for risk factors such as family history (40.8-98%), reproductive history (21-90%) and obesity (34-6%). Awareness levels were not consistently higher for the stronger determinants of risk. Our review revealed low cancer literacy of breast cancer risk factors among Indian women, irrespective of their socio-economic and educational background. There is an urgent need for nation- and state-wide awareness programmes, engaging multiple stakeholders of society and the health system, to help improve cancer literacy in India."
Using the Theory of Planned Behaviour and implementation intentions to predict and facilitate upward family communication about mammography.,"Browne, Chan",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21981385/,"Daughter-initiated communication about mammography within mother-daughter dyads may promote mammography to women of screening age. Regular mammography facilitates early detection of breast cancer, and thus increases the chances of survival from this disease.","Regular mammography facilitates early detection of breast cancer, and thus increases the chances of survival from this disease. Daughter-initiated (i.e. upward) communication about mammography within mother-daughter dyads may promote mammography to women of screening age. The current study examined this communication behaviour within the context of the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), and aimed to bridge the intention-behaviour gap by trialling an implementation intention (II) intervention that aimed to facilitate upward family communication about mammography. Young women aged 18-39 (N=116) were assigned to either a control or experimental condition, and the latter group formed IIs about initiating a conversation with an older female family member about mammography. Overall, those who formed IIs were more likely to engage in the target communication behaviour, however the intervention was most effective for those who reported low levels of intention at baseline. Perceived behavioural control emerged as the most important variable in predicting the target behaviour. The altruistic nature of this behaviour, and the fact that it is not wholly under volitional control, may have contributed to this finding. Future studies that systematically explore the relative roles of intention and perceived behavioural control in behaviours of this nature are warranted."
Breast cancer risk in relation to amount of tissue removed during breast reduction operations in Sweden.,"Brinton, Persson, Boice, McLaughlin, Fraumeni",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11169929/,The amount of tissue removed was a significant predictor of risk. Subjects in the highest quartile of tissue removal had a significantly lower risk than those in the lowest quartile. This relation persisted after adjustment for other breast cancer risk factors and was apparent within every subgroup examined.,"Women who undergo breast reduction operations have substantially lowered risks of breast cancer, and the reasons remain unclear. The current investigation attempted to assess whether the reduction in breast cancer risk was related directly to the amount of breast tissue removed. Medical record retrieval was attempted for 161 breast cancer patients in a Swedish cohort of 31,910 women who had had breast reduction surgery and for 483 women who had not developed breast cancer. Information on amount of breast tissue removed was abstracted along with other factors that influence breast cancer risk. Odds ratios of developing breast cancer were calculated based on amount of breast tissue removed. The amount of tissue removed was a significant predictor of risk, as subjects in the highest quartile of tissue removal had a significantly lower risk than those in the lowest quartile. Considering the total amount of tissue removed (both breasts), subjects with > or = 1600 versus < 800 grams removed had an odds ratio (OR) of 0.24 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.1-0.5]. This relation persisted after adjustment for other breast cancer risk factors and was apparent within every subgroup examined. The finding that breast cancer risk was reduced in proportion to the amount of tissue removed should be reassuring to women who are considering breast reduction procedures and to women who are electing to have bilateral total prophylactic mastectomies because of a strong genetic predisposition."
Efficacy of bilateral prophylactic mastectomy in women with a family history of breast cancer.,"Hartmann, Schaid, Woods, Crotty, Myers, Arnold, Petty, Sellers, Johnson, McDonnell, Frost, Jenkins","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S., Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9887158/,"Prophylactic mastectomy can significantly reduce the incidence of breast cancer. Options for women at high risk for breast cancer include surveillance, chemoprevention.

The data on the outcomes for surveillance and prophylactic mastectomy are incomplete. We conducted a retrospective study of all women with a family history of breast cancer who underwent bilateral prophylactic mastectomy at the Mayo Clinic between 1960 and 1993. The women were divided into two groups - high risk and moderate risk - on the basis of family history. A control study of the sisters of the high-risk probands and the Gail model were used to predict the number of breast cancers expected in these two groups in the absence of prophylactic mastectomy. We identified 639 women with a family history of breast cancer who had undergone bilateral prophylactic mastectomy: 214 at high risk and 425 at moderate risk. The median length of follow-up was 14 years. The median age at prophylactic mastectomy was 42 years. According to the Gall model, 37.4 breast cancers were expected in the moderate-risk group; 4 breast cancers occurred (reduction in risk, 89.5 percent; P<0.001). We compared the numbers of breast cancers among the 214 high-risk probands with the numbers among their 403 sisters who had not undergone prophylactic mastectomy. Of these sisters, 38.7 percent (156) had been given a diagnosis of breast cancer (115 cases were diagnosed before the respective proband's prophylactic mastectomy, 38 were diagnosed afterward, and the time of the diagnosis was unknown in 3 cases). By contrast, breast cancer was diagnosed in 1.4 percent (3 of 214) of the probands. Thus, prophylactic mastectomy was associated with a reduction in the incidence of breast cancer of at least 90 percent. In women with a high risk of breast cancer on the basis of family history, prophylactic mastectomy can significantly reduce the incidence of breast cancer."
Influence of physical activity in different age and life periods on the risk of breast cancer.,"Friedenreich, Courneya, Bryant","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11679785/,"Study looked at 1,237 incident breast cancer cases and 1,241 controls in Alberta between 1995 and 1997.

In this study, we measured all types of physical activity done throughout life with a questionnaire developed and tested specifically for this study. We found that breast cancer risk was most associated with a risk reduction for activity done later in life, particularly between menopause and the reference year, for which we observed an odds ratio of 0.70 (95% confidence interval = 0.52-0.95). We also stratified the study participants into four categories according to their patterns of physical activity performed before and after menopause. For the women who sustained physical activity throughout life vs those who were never active, we found an odds ratio of 0.58 (95% confidence interval = 0.41-0.83). This study suggests that sustained activity throughout life and particularly activity done later in life may have the most benefit in reducing breast cancer risk."

Our purpose was to explore the associations between young women's reported cancer history, BSE training, demographic variables (predictors), self-reported frequency of BSE, BSE skill level, breast lump detection ability, confidence, and anxiety (outcome variables). A general health history questionnaire was administered to 73 female university students, faculty, and staff. BSE skill and detection ability were measured by observation; confidence and anxiety ratings were obtained by interview. BSE frequency was predicted by employment status and cyclically enlarged breasts, while BSE skill was related to professional BSE training and the length of that training plus bra size. Surprisingly, BSE training was not found to be associated with self-reported BSE frequency. These analyses suggest that BSE training may result in more complete BSE (although well below acceptable standards) performed by women who are moderately confident and sensitive to the risk of breast cancer--but not in more frequent BSE."

CHCs are providing access to Pap smear testing, mammography, and clinical breast examination for women who are at an increased risk for morbidity and mortality associated with cancers of the cervix and breast. A higher proportion of CHC women of most racial and ethnic groups and women below poverty level are up to date on cancer screening than comparison groups. In most cases, CHC women meet or exceed the Healthy People 2000 objectives for the nation."

The study also considered the influence of breast cancer worries and past behaviour. Eight hundred and thirty-three women completed questionnaires, based on the HBM, to assess their beliefs about breast cancer and BSE. Of these women, 567 were followed-up at 9 months when BSE frequency was assessed. Discriminant function analysis was employed to discriminate among infrequent, appropriate and excessive BSE. Two functions were calculated which were predictive of group membership. The first function maximally discriminated between the infrequent BSE group and the other two groups, with infrequent selfexaminers reporting a greater number of self-efficacy and emotion barriers, fewer benefits and less frequent BSE at Time 1. The second function maximally discriminated between the excessive BSE group and the appropriate BSE group, with excessive selfexaminers reporting higher levels of breast cancer worries and perceived severity and fewer self-efficacy barriers. The results highlight the importance of focusing on excessive as well as infrequent BSE. Interventions designed to enhance women's confidence in their ability to perform BSE, coupled with attempts to reduce breast cancer worries, may encourage more appropriate and effective BSE."

In addition, of the 343 carriers who provided both ancestry and family history information, 44% did not have a first-degree family history of a BRCA-related cancer and, in the absence of a personal history of cancer, would therefore be unlikely to qualify for clinical genetic testing. These findings may help inform the discussion around broader access to BRCA genetic testing."

A recent population-based study demonstrated that the proportion of patients with unilateral breast cancer in the United States who underwent contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM) has increased by 150% in recent years. The current study evaluated patients who underwent breast cancer surgery in a metropolitan-based hospital system to determine factors associated with CPM. We reviewed the records of all patients who underwent surgical treatment for breast cancer in 2006 and 2007 in a single health care system, which included six different hospitals. Exclusion criteria included preoperative diagnosis of bilateral disease, stage IV disease, and a history of previous breast cancer. We recorded patient, treatment, tumor, and surgeon characteristics. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to predict CPM use. Of 571 eligible patients, 276 (48.3%) underwent breast-conserving surgery (BCS), 130 (22.8%) underwent unilateral mastectomy, and 165 (28.9%) underwent mastectomy and a CPM. Among mastectomy patients, 55.9% underwent CPM. Young age (<40 vs. >55 years), large tumor size (>5 vs. <2 cm), positive family history, lobular histology, multicentric disease, and surgeon gender (female) were independent predictors of increased CPM rates. Body mass index, tumor grade, estrogen receptor status, and preoperative breast magnetic resonance imaging were not associated with increased CPM rates. Our study is the first to evaluate specific surgeon characteristics associated with CPM use. Prospective studies are needed to examine factors affecting patient decision-making to develop resources that may assist patients in this process."

Such models can be used in a variety of settings for prevention, screening, and guiding investigations and treatments. Models aimed at predicting future disease risk that contains lifestyle factors may be of particular use for targeting health promotion activities at an individual level. This type of cancer risk prediction is not yet available in the UK. We have adopted the approach used by the well-established U.S.-derived ""YourCancerRisk"" model for use in the UK population, which allow users to quantify their individual risk of developing individual cancers relative to the population average risk. The UK version of ""YourCancerRisk"" computes 10-year cancer risk estimates for 11 cancers utilizing UK figures for prevalence of risk factors and cancer incidence. Because the prevalence of risk factors and the incidence rates for cancer are different between the U.S. and the UK population, this UK model provides more accurate estimates of risks for a UK population. Using an example of breast cancer and data from UK Biobank cohort, we demonstrate that the individual risk factor estimates are similar for the U.S. and UK populations. Assessment of the performance and validation of the multivariate model predictions based on a binary score confirm the model's applicability. The model can be used to estimate absolute and relative cancer risk for use in Primary Care and community settings and is being used in the community to guide lifestyle change. <i>Cancer Prev Res; 10(7); 421-30.

Previous work has found that while women in Western countries are aware that breast cancer can be hereditary, their knowledge of the influence of lifestyle is poor. This survey investigated on the awareness of breast cancer risk factors in university students from 23 countries between 1999 and 2001. Data were collected on awareness of links with heredity, alcohol use, exercise, obesity, stress, smoking and diet. Almost a third of women were not aware that any of these factors influenced breast cancer. Just 57% were aware of the genetic link and fewer than 1 in 20 women correctly identified alcohol, exercise or obesity as factors influencing breast cancer. Stress and smoking were the most commonly chosen lifestyle risk factors although current data suggest that they have little actual impact on breast cancer risk. There was considerable international variation, with highest levels of awareness in students in the United States of America (USA). Knowledge of risk in this sample was poorer than previously observed in older women. Health messages concerning cancer in general may be more relevant for this age group, because of the lower salience of breast cancer for younger women."

However, among those over 50 years of age, ever-drinking conferred a relative risk of 1.8 (95% confidence interval = 1.2-2.6). Current and former drinkers had similar increases in risk. No particular latent period of alcohol effect was identified, but drinking later in life to have a bigger effect than did drinking earlier in life."

Most believe that a mammogram is the best method of diagnosis (87%) but a minority (14%) agree with the statement that breast cancer can be caused by breast feeding. In general, younger women are better informed and more optimistic about prognosis. In Spain there are problems in disseminating information about cancer to lower social-economic groups. These results confirm that more cancer education needs to be directed to low income and socially deprived groups."

We conducted a discrete choice experiment among a general community sample of women who completed 12 hypothetical choices between routine monitoring and CPM described by aspects of treatment efficacy, safety, cost and involvement in decision-making. Respondents also completed a modified cancer worry question to assess cancer concern. Approximately 57.5% of 464 women always chose one option, typically routine monitoring. The majority (71.5%) reported being concerned about cancer recurrence when completing choice tasks. Latent class analysis identified three groups: preferred routine monitoring; preferred CPM; and ""traders"" (willing to swap between options). Among traders, women were less likely to choose an option associated with higher risk of recurrence. Women were more likely to choose options associated with less-intrusive monitoring methods and where they were involved in decision-making. Women concerned about cancer recurrence were more likely to choose CPM over monitoring.

All women were followed up 4-6 weeks later. Women with M3 or M4 mammography or with suspicious ultrasound findings on initial clinical visit were investigated further; 96.53% presented with a lump in the breast. Aspiration was performed in all women. Three patients had a residual lump on 4-6 week follow up. One was found to be benign and two were revealed to have cancer. The mammogram findings in these two patients were M3 and they would have merited further investigation anyway.

We studied the efficacy of bilateral prophylactic mastectomy in women with elevated breast cancer risk cared for in community practices. We conducted a retrospective case-cohort study of women aged 18 to 80 years with 1 or more breast cancer risk factors (family history of breast cancer, history of atypical hyperplasia, or > or =1 breast biopsies with benign findings). Using computerized data and medical records, we identified 276 women with bilateral prophylactic mastectomy and a stratified random sample of 196 women representing an underlying cohort of 666 800 women with elevated breast cancer risk without prophylactic mastectomy, and then we determined who developed breast cancer. Breast cancer developed in 1 woman (0.4%) after bilateral prophylactic mastectomy vs 26 800 women (4.0%) without prophylactic mastectomy. Stratifying by birth year, the hazard ratio for breast cancer occurrence after bilateral prophylactic mastectomy was 0.005 (95% confidence interval, 0.001-0.044). No woman with bilateral prophylactic mastectomy died of breast cancer vs a calculated 0.2% of women without prophylactic mastectomy. Bilateral prophylactic mastectomy reduced breast cancer incidence in women at elevated risk for breast cancer cared for in community-based practices. However, the absolute risk of breast cancer incidence and death in women who did not undergo the procedure in these settings was relatively low."
Improved screening for breast cancer associated with a telephone-based risk assessment.,"Kadison, Pelletier, Mounib, Oppedisano, Poteat","Journal Article, Multicenter Study",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9612841/,"A voice-response, telephone system collected risk information from callers and gave real-time risk assessment. A population of women with a risk profile higher than that of the U.S. population called the survey. Self-reported, increased genetic risk for breast cancer was strongly correlated with a decision to remain anonymous.","Our objective was to develop and field-test a telephone-based breast cancer risk assessment and to assess its efficacy in improving screening behavior. The study was performed at a financial institution and a manufacturing corporation with main offices in Boston, Massachusetts, and branch offices in various regions of the United States. A longitudinal study consisting of an initial health risk assessment administered by telephone, with a subsequent follow-up study initiated 8 months later, was performed. Study design was influenced by some of the suggestions made by the benefits departments of the corporate sponsors. A voice-response, telephone system collected risk information from callers and gave real-time risk assessment. These callers could receive a risk assessment over the phone and remain completely anonymous or furnish name and address to receive a more detailed written report. Main outcome measures included the response rate and demographics of the respondents, risk profiles of the callers, and breast cancer screening statuses. There were 343 participants of whom 189 relinquished anonymity to receive more detailed information by mail and were available for a follow-up study. Sixty-three women (18%) reported a family history of breast cancer, with 34 women (10%) responding that one first-degree blood relative had been diagnosed before the age of 50. A strong positive correlation between the level of familial risk and the decision to remain anonymous existed (P < 0.0001). There was an increase in compliance with breast self-examination from 34% (40/119) at time of use of the system to 62% (74/119) at follow-up, P < 0.0001. Clinical breast exams showed similar improvements, from 82 (98/119) to 92% (110/119), P < 0.0137. Paired and unpaired data of women 40 years of age and older indicate an improvement in mammography compliance from time of system use to follow-up, 76 (22/29) to 93% (27/29), P < 0.0572, and 79 (33/42) to 93% (27/29), P < 0.0129, respectively. A population of women with a risk profile higher than that of the U.S. population called the survey. System use is associated with an improvement in breast cancer screening habits. Self-reported, increased genetic risk for breast cancer was strongly correlated with a decision to remain anonymous."

They were more effective in combination, mainly in increasing knowledge of breast self-examination, rather than knowledge of breast cancer or breast abnormalities."
Screening women aged less than 50 years with a family history of breast cancer.,"Kollias, Sibbering, Blamey, Holland, Obuszko, Wilson, Evans, Ellis, Elston",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9797701/,Family history is an important breast cancer risk factor. 1371 asymptomatic women aged less than 50 years underwent annual clinical breast examination and biennial mammography due to a family history of breast cancer. 29 cancers (23 invasive and 6 in situ) were detected or presented as interval cancer.,"Family history is an important breast cancer risk factor and is a common reason for referral to specialist breast clinics for consideration of breast screening. The aims of this study were to determine cancer detection rates and prognostic features of breast cancers identified in women aged less than 50 years at increased risk of breast cancer who attend a Family History Breast Screening Clinic (FHC). Between January 1988 and December 1995, 1371 asymptomatic women aged less than 50 years underwent annual clinical breast examination and biennial mammography due to a family history of breast cancer. A total of 29 cancers (23 invasive and 6 in situ) were detected or presented as interval cancer during a mean follow-up of 22 months (range 0-96 months). This gave a relative risk for invasive breast cancer in this high-risk group of 5 when compared with an age-matched female population in the U.K. The cancer screening detection rates were similar to those of women aged 50 years or over undergoing population screening in the NHS Breast Screening Programme (NHSBSP)--FHC prevalent screen 8 per 1000 screening visits versus NHSBSP 6.5 per 1000, FHC incident screen 3.3 per 1000 screening visits versus NHSBSP 3.8 per 1000. A higher proportion of in situ cancers were detected in the FHC screened group compared with cancers identified in symptomatic patients from an age-matched risk group (21% versus 4%). No differences were demonstrated for invasive tumour size, grade or lymph node stage between symptomatic and screened women. The early results of this study suggests that young women at risk of breast cancer due to a family history may benefit from regular breast screening due to the early detection of in situ lesions."

Women who consumed more fruits and vegetables had received more recent mammography, and that women who were unemployed were less likely to receive recent breast cancer screening.","The consumption of green, yellow, and other vegetables, fruits and fruit juices may be protective against breast cancer, and, alongside regular breast cancer screening, may contribute to ethnic and racial differences in breast cancer rates. The purpose of this study is to assess the dietary and sociodemographic predictors of surveillance among Harlem women, using a population-based household survey. One half of the Harlem women in this sample consumed no or one fruit or vegetable per day. Logistic regression analyses revealed that women who consumed more fruits and vegetables had received more recent mammography, and that women who were unemployed were less likely to receive recent breast cancer screening than were those who worked full- or part-time. The high response rate and the representativeness of the sample are study strengths. Owing to the small sample size for women between 40-65, the ages for which screening mammography and clinical breast exam are recommended, subgroup analyses were limited. Therefore, additional study of age-adjusted dietary patterns and screening among African American women is suggested."

WISER is a randomized controlled trial examining the effects of exercise training on oxidative stress, and hormonal and metabolic factors associated with breast cancer risk. Subjects were recruited via emails, flyers, and mass media advertising. Inclusion criteria included: sedentary, age 18-30 years, non-smokers, BMI 18-40 kg/m2, not using any hormonal contraceptives. After completion of all baseline measures subjects were randomized into a control group or an exercise intervention for 4 menstrual cycles. The exercise group was asked to complete five 45 min exercise sessions per week. Exercise intensity was set at 65-70% of maximum age- predicted heart rate (max HR) and increased every four weeks. All women provided blood samples four times during the study for measurement of blood F2-isoprostanes, hormones and IGF-axis proteins. In addition, 24-hour urine samples were collected at baseline and follow-up for measurement of estrogen metabolites, as well as 24-hour food records to monitor participants' diets. WISER consented 683 women among which 391 enrolled and 319 successfully completed the study. The overall dropout rate was 18.4% (n=72) with a higher number of participants dropping from the exercise group (n=46). No differences were found between dropouts and completers with respect to age, body weight, BMI, and demographic characteristics with the exception of degree of education. Findings from this trial will be useful in understanding the physiologic mechanisms by which exercise possibly contributes to decreased breast cancer risk."

We used a panel of 34 putative susceptibility genes to perform sequencing on samples from 60,466 women with breast cancer and 53,461 controls. In separate analyses for protein-truncating variants and rare missense variants in these genes, we estimated odds ratios for breast cancer overall and tumor subtypes. We evaluated missense-variant associations according to domain and classification of pathogenicity. Protein-truncating variants in 5 genes (<i>ATM</i>, <i>BRCA1</i>, <i>BRCA2</i>, <i>CHEK2</i>, and <i>PALB2</i>) were associated with a risk of breast cancer overall with a P value of less than 0.0001. Protein-truncating variants in 4 other genes (<i>BARD1</i>, <i>RAD51C</i>, <i>RAD51D</i>, and <i>TP53</i>) were associated with a risk of breast cancer overall with a P value of less than 0.05 and a Bayesian false-discovery probability of less than 0.05. For protein-truncating variants in 19 of the remaining 25 genes, the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval of the odds ratio for breast cancer overall was less than 2.0. For protein-truncating variants in <i>ATM</i> and <i>CHEK2</i>, odds ratios were higher for estrogen receptor (ER)-positive disease than for ER-negative disease; for protein-truncating variants in <i>BARD1</i>, <i>BRCA1</i>, <i>BRCA2</i>, <i>PALB2</i>, <i>RAD51C</i>, and <i>RAD51D</i>, odds ratios were higher for ER-negative disease than for ER-positive disease. Rare missense variants (in aggregate) in <i>ATM</i>, <i>CHEK2</i>, and <i>TP53</i> were associated with a risk of breast cancer overall with a P value of less than 0.001. For <i>BRCA1</i>, <i>BRCA2</i>, and <i>TP53</i>, missense variants (in aggregate) that would be classified as pathogenic according to standard criteria were associated with a risk of breast cancer overall, with the risk being similar to that of protein-truncating variants. The results of this study define the genes that are most clinically useful for inclusion on panels for the prediction of breast cancer risk, as well as provide estimates of the risks associated with protein-truncating variants, to guide genetic counseling.

The initial third of the article considers: activity and prevention definitions; historical evidence showing physical inactivity is detrimental to health and normal organ functional capacities; cause versus treatment; physical activity and inactivity mechanisms differ; gene-environment interaction (including aerobic training adaptations, personalized medicine, and co-twin physical activity); and specificity of adaptations to type of training. Next, physical activity/exercise is examined as primary prevention against 35 chronic conditions [accelerated biological aging/premature death, low cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max), sarcopenia, metabolic syndrome, obesity, insulin resistance, prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, coronary heart disease, peripheral artery disease, hypertension, stroke, congestive heart failure, endothelial dysfunction, arterial dyslipidemia, hemostasis, deep vein thrombosis, cognitive dysfunction, depression and anxiety, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, balance, bone fracture/falls, rheumatoid arthritis, colon cancer, breast cancer, endometrial cancer, gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, polycystic ovary syndrome, erectile dysfunction, pain, diverticulitis, constipation, and gallbladder diseases]. The article ends with consideration of deterioration of risk factors in longer-term sedentary groups; clinical consequences of inactive childhood/adolescence; and public policy. In summary, the body rapidly maladapts to insufficient physical activity, and if continued, results in substantial decreases in both total and quality years of life. Taken together, conclusive evidence exists that physical inactivity is one important cause of most chronic diseases. In addition, physical activity primarily prevents, or delays, chronic diseases, implying that chronic disease need not be an inevitable outcome during life."

We analyzed data from 6178 families, 125 with pathogenic variants in RAD51C, and 6690 families, 60 with pathogenic variants in RAD51D. TOC and BC relative and cumulative risks were estimated using complex segregation analysis to model the cancer inheritance patterns in families while adjusting for the mode of ascertainment of each family. All statistical tests were two-sided. Pathogenic variants in both RAD51C and RAD51D were associated with TOC (RAD51C: relative risk [RR] = 7.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 5.60 to 10.19; P = 5 Ã— 10-40; RAD51D: RR = 7.60, 95% CI = 5.61 to 10.30; P = 5 Ã— 10-39) and BC (RAD51C: RR = 1.99, 95% CI = 1.39 to 2.85; P = 1.55 Ã— 10-4; RAD51D: RR = 1.83, 95% CI = 1.24 to 2.72; P = .002). For both RAD51C and RAD51D, there was a suggestion that the TOC relative risks increased with age until around age 60 years and decreased thereafter. The estimated cumulative risks of developing TOC to age 80 years were 11% (95% CI = 6% to 21%) for RAD51C and 13% (95% CI = 7% to 23%) for RAD51D pathogenic variant carriers. The estimated cumulative risks of developing BC to 80 years were 21% (95% CI = 15% to 29%) for RAD51C and 20% (95% CI = 14% to 28%) for RAD51D pathogenic variant carriers. Both TOC and BC risks for RAD51C and RAD51D pathogenic variant carriers varied by cancer family history and could be as high as 32-36% for TOC, for carriers with two first-degree relatives diagnosed with TOC, or 44-46% for BC, for carriers with two first-degree relatives diagnosed with BC. These estimates will facilitate the genetic counseling of RAD51C and RAD51D pathogenic variant carriers and justify the incorporation of RAD51C and RAD51D into cancer risk prediction models."

Current estimates of cancer burden in individual countries and regions are necessary to inform local cancer control strategies. To estimate mortality, incidence, years lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 28 cancers in 188 countries by sex from 1990 to 2013. The general methodology of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2013 study was used. Cancer registries were the source for cancer incidence data as well as mortality incidence (MI) ratios. Sources for cause of death data include vital registration system data, verbal autopsy studies, and other sources. The MI ratios were used to transform incidence data to mortality estimates and cause of death estimates to incidence estimates. Cancer prevalence was estimated using MI ratios as surrogates for survival data; YLDs were calculated by multiplying prevalence estimates with disability weights, which were derived from population-based surveys; YLLs were computed by multiplying the number of estimated cancer deaths at each age with a reference life expectancy; and DALYs were calculated as the sum of YLDs and YLLs. In 2013 there were 14.9 million incident cancer cases, 8.2 million deaths, and 196.3 million DALYs. Prostate cancer was the leading cause for cancer incidence (1.4 million) for men and breast cancer for women (1.8 million). Tracheal, bronchus, and lung (TBL) cancer was the leading cause for cancer death in men and women, with 1.6 million deaths. For men, TBL cancer was the leading cause of DALYs (24.9 million). For women, breast cancer was the leading cause of DALYs (13.1 million). Age-standardized incidence rates (ASIRs) per 100 000 and age-standardized death rates (ASDRs) per 100 000 for both sexes in 2013 were higher in developing vs developed countries for stomach cancer (ASIR, 17 vs 14; ASDR, 15 vs 11), liver cancer (ASIR, 15 vs 7; ASDR, 16 vs 7), esophageal cancer (ASIR, 9 vs 4; ASDR, 9 vs 4), cervical cancer (ASIR, 8 vs 5; ASDR, 4 vs 2), lip and oral cavity cancer (ASIR, 7 vs 6; ASDR, 2 vs 2), and nasopharyngeal cancer (ASIR, 1.5 vs 0.4; ASDR, 1.2 vs 0.3). Between 1990 and 2013, ASIRs for all cancers combined (except nonmelanoma skin cancer and Kaposi sarcoma) increased by more than 10% in 113 countries and decreased by more than 10% in 12 of 188 countries. Cancer poses a major threat to public health worldwide, and incidence rates have increased in most countries since 1990. The trend is a particular threat to developing nations with health systems that are ill-equipped to deal with complex and expensive cancer treatments. The annual update on the Global Burden of Cancer will provide all stakeholders with timely estimates to guide policy efforts in cancer prevention, screening, treatment, and palliation."

Cancer incidence and mortality among 170 404 cancer survivors of 5 or more years who were aged 15-39 years at first primary cancer diagnosis during 1975-2013 in 9 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries were compared with those in the general population using standardized incidence ratio (SIR), absolute excess incidence (AEI), standardized mortality ratio (SMR), and absolute excess mortality (AEM). During a mean follow-up of 14.6 years, 13 420 SPC cases and 5008 SPC deaths occurred among survivors (excluding the same site as index cancer), corresponding to 25% higher incidence (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.23 to 1.27, AEI = 10.8 per 10 000) and 84% higher mortality (95% CI = 1.79 to 1.89, AEM = 9.2 per 10 000) than that in the general population.

Type-specific SPC risks varied substantially by index cancers; however, SPCs of the female breast, lung, and colorectum combined constituted 36% of all SPC cases and 39% of all SPC deaths, with lung cancer alone representing 11% and 24% of all cases and deaths, respectively. AYA cancer survivors are almost twice as likely to die from a new primary cancer as the general population, highlighting the need for primary care clinicians to prioritize cancer prevention and targeted surveillance strategies in these individuals."
Second primary breast cancer after unilateral mastectomy alone or with contralateral prophylactic mastectomy.,"Agarwal, Pappas, Matsen, Agarwal",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32918537/,An increasing number of patients undergo contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM) for unilateral breast cancer.

However, the benefit of CPM has not been quantified in the setting of contemporary breast cancer therapy. We performed an analysis of 180 068 patients in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, diagnosed with unilateral ductal breast carcinoma between 1998 and 2013 and treated with unilateral mastectomy (UM) or CPM. UM was performed in 146 213 patients (81.2%); CPM was performed in 33 855 patients (19.8%). Primary outcome of interest was cumulative incidence of a second primary breast cancer in the ipsilateral or contralateral breast greater than 3 months after initial diagnosis. Cumulative incidence analysis was based on a Cox proportional model to generate curves of second primary breast cancer in any breast, ipsilateral breast only, or contralateral breast only. Patients who underwent CPM had a significantly reduced incidence of second primary breast cancer 10 and 15 years after surgery (CPM 0.93% [0.73%, 1.12%] vs UM 4.44% [4.28%, 4.60%]). Patients who underwent CPM had significantly lower adjusted hazard of second primary breast cancer when compared with UM (HR 0.38 vs 1.0, P < .0001). CPM offers some protection from a second primary breast cancer, attributable to a reduced incidence in the contralateral breast. These findings provide additional information to providers and patients as they make decisions regarding surgical management. They should also be interpreted in the context of the absolute incidence of second primary breast cancer after UM and previous literature demonstrating no survival benefit."

This trial aimed to assess postoperative circulating tumor cell counts-an independent prognostic factor for breast cancer-to determine how anesthesia may indirectly affect prognosis. It was hypothesized that patients receiving sevoflurane would have higher postoperative tumor cell counts. The parallel, randomized controlled trial was conducted in two centers in Switzerland. Patients aged 18 to 85 yr without metastases and scheduled for primary breast cancer surgery were eligible. The patients were randomly assigned to either sevoflurane or propofol anesthesia. The patients and outcome assessors were blinded. The primary outcome was circulating tumor cell counts over time, assessed at three time points postoperatively (0, 48, and 72 h) by the CellSearch assay. Secondary outcomes included maximal circulating tumor cells value, positivity (cutoff: at least 1 and at least 5 tumor cells/7.5 ml blood), and the association between natural killer cell activity and tumor cell counts. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02005770). Between March 2014 and April 2018, 210 participants were enrolled, assigned to sevoflurane (n = 107) or propofol (n = 103) anesthesia, and eventually included in the analysis. Anesthesia type did not affect circulating tumor cell counts over time (median circulating tumor cell count [interquartile range]; for propofol: 1 [0 to 4] at 0 h, 1 [0 to 2] at 48 h, and 0 [0 to 1] at 72 h; and for sevoflurane: 1 [0 to 4] at 0 h, 0 [0 to 2] at 48 h, and 1 [0 to 2] at 72 h; rate ratio, 1.27 [95% CI, 0.95 to 1.71]; P = 0.103) or positivity. In one secondary analysis, administrating sevoflurane led to a significant increase in maximal tumor cell counts postoperatively. There was no association between natural killer cell activity and circulating tumor cell counts. In this randomized controlled trial investigating the effect of anesthesia on an independent prognostic factor for breast cancer, there was no difference between sevoflurane and propofol with respect to circulating tumor cell counts over time."

Females, >18 years old, registered with the Primary Health Care Corporation were invited to complete an Arabic or English online survey using a modified version of the Breast Cancer Awareness Module. Of the 9008 participants, 69% report awareness of breast cancer warning signs, but the results did not substantiate these claims. There remains a disconnect between participantsâ€™ perceived awareness of their ability to detect breast cancer and their actual recognition of individual signs and symptoms. Nearly half (45.4%) report rarely or never checking their breasts for abnormalities (44.6%). Breast self-examination (BSE) and Breast Cancer Screening (BCS) uptake is low and many are unaware of the starting age for invitation to Qatarâ€™s BCS program. While only 18% of women report receiving an invitation, 94% attended, indicating that the BCS invitation is a remarkably effective means of improving screening uptake. Policymakers should capitalize on early recognition, which is possible in the youthful population. Broadening awareness campaigns and interventions targeting a broader audience including males, community and religious leaders and healthcare professionals may prove more effective in Arab communities."

This study examined the barriers and facilitators to chemoprevention use for Australian women at increased risk of breast cancer, and their clinicians. Surveys, based on the Theoretical Domains Framework, were mailed to 1,113 women at â‰¥16% lifetime risk of breast cancer who were enrolled in the Kathleen Cuningham Foundation Consortium for Research into Familial Breast Cancer cohort study (kConFab), and their 524 treating clinicians. Seven hundred twenty-five women (65%) and 221 (42%) clinicians responded. Only 10 (1.4%) kConFab women had ever taken chemoprevention. Three hundred seventy-eight (52%) kConFab women, two (3%) breast surgeons, and 51 (35%) family physicians were not aware of chemoprevention. For women, the strongest barriers to chemoprevention were side effects (31%) and inadequate information (23%), which operate in the Theoretical Domains Framework domains of ""beliefs about consequences"" and ""knowledge,"" respectively. Strongest facilitators related to tamoxifen's long-term efficacy (35%, ""knowledge,"" ""beliefs about consequences,"" and ""goals"" domains), staying healthy for family (13%, ""social role"" and ""goals"" domains), and abnormal breast biopsy (13%, ""environmental context"" domain). The strongest barrier for family physicians was insufficient knowledge (45%, ""knowledge"" domain) and for breast surgeons was medication side effects (40%, ""beliefs about consequences"" domain). The strongest facilitators for both clinician groups related to clear guidelines, strong family history, and better tools to select patients (""environmental context and resources"" domain). Clinician knowledge and resources, and beliefs about the side-effect consequences of chemoprevention, are key domains that could be targeted to potentially enhance uptake. PREVENTION RELEVANCE: Despite its efficacy in reducing breast cancer incidence, chemoprevention is underutilised. This survey study of Australian women and their clinicians used behavioural change theory to identify modifiable barriers to chemoprevention uptake, and to suggest interventions such as policy change, educational resources and public campaigns, that may increase awareness and use.<i>See related Spotlight by Vogel, p. 1</i>."

To assess the survival impact of SPMs in adolescents and young adults (AYAs) (15-39 years) compared with that of pediatric (<15 years) and older adult (â‰¥40 years) patients with the same SPMs. This was a population-based, retrospective cohort study of patients with cancer in 13 Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results regions in the United States diagnosed from 1992 to 2008 and followed through 2013. Data analysis was performed between June 2016 and January 2017. Five-year relative survival was calculated overall and for each cancer occurring as a PM or SPM by age at diagnosis. The impact of SPM status on cancer-specific death was examined using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. A total of 15 954 pediatric, 125 750 AYAs, and 878 370 older adult patients diagnosed as having 14 cancers occurring as a PM or SPM were included. Overall, 5-year survival after an SPM was 33.1% lower for children, 20.2% lower for AYAs, and 8.3% lower for older adults compared with a PM at the same age. For the most common SPMs in AYAs, the absolute difference in 5-year survival was 42% lower for secondary non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 19% for secondary breast carcinoma, 15% for secondary thyroid carcinoma, and 13% for secondary soft-tissue sarcoma. Survival by SPM status was significantly worse in younger vs older patients for thyroid, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, acute myeloid leukemia, soft-tissue sarcoma, and central nervous system cancer. Adolescents and young adults with secondary Hodgkin lymphoma (hazard ratio [95% CI], 3.5 [1.7-7.1]); soft-tissue sarcoma (2.8 [2.1-3.9]); breast carcinoma (2.1 [1.8-2.4]); acute myeloid leukemia (1.9 [1.5-2.4]); and central nervous system cancer (1.8 [1.2-2.8]) experienced worse survival compared with AYAs with the same PMs. The adverse impact of SPMs on survival is substantial for AYAs and may partially explain the relative lack of survival improvement in AYAs compared with other age groups. The impact of a particular SPM diagnosis on survival may inform age-specific prevention, screening, treatment, and survivorship recommendations."

Although largely asymptomatic, some types of HPVs (HPV-16, HPV-18) which infect the genitalia are known to cause cancers, including cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is an important public health concern and is the second most clinically important cancer to breast cancer in women aged 15-44 years. Until recently, cervical cancer strategies focussed on screening. However, as adolescents become sexually active at a much younger age, the focus is on the use of vaccination as an effective measure to prevent progression of HPV infection to cancer. HPV is also involved in the aetiology of cancers of the anus, vagina, vulva and penis as well as genital warts and laryngeal papillomatosis in young children. Primary prevention through vaccination is now possible in Europe using either the quadrivalent HPV vaccine, GardasilÂ® (Sanofi Pasteur MSD), or the bivalent HPV vaccine, CervarixÂ® (GSK), which are both highly immunogenic, with their effects persisting for at least 5 years. HPV vaccines are well tolerated, with serious vaccine-related events occurring in less than 0.1% of patients for both vaccines. Here, we review the possibilities for utilising vaccination programmes alongside current cervical cancer screening in comprehensive cervical cancer prevention programmes. The European Academy of Paediatrics Scientific Working Group on Vaccination concluded that the use of HPV vaccines will have a significant impact in primary prevention of cancers and other HPV-related disease."

We summarised the existing evidence on SMBC after childhood cancer in a systematic review and investigated the risk of SMBC among males in a Pan-European cohort. We searched Medline/PubMed for cohort studies and case reports/series that assessed SMBC after childhood cancer (â‰¤21 years). Furthermore, we analysed data on SMBC in the PanCareSurFup cohort, reporting standardised incidence ratios (SIRs), absolute excess risks (AERs), and 5- and 10-year survival rates. The systematic review included 38 of 7080 potentially eligible articles. Cohort-specific SMBC frequencies were 0-0.40% (31 studies). SMBC occurred after a follow-up ranging from 24.0 to 42.0 years. Nine case reports/series described 11 SMBC cases, occurring 11.0-42.5 years after primary childhood cancer. In the PanCareSurFup cohort (16 SMBC/37,738 males; 0.04%), we observed a 22.3-fold increased risk of SMBC relative to the general male population (95% CI 12.7-36.2; absolute excess risk/100,000 person-years: 2.3, 95% CI 1.3-3.7). The five- and ten-year survival rates after SMBC diagnosis were 60.3% (95% CI 35.6%-85.0%) and 43.0% (95% CI 16.1%-69.9%), respectively. Clear evidence of risk factors did not emerge from these comprehensive efforts. Compared to the general population, male CCSs have an elevated risk of developing subsequent breast cancer, although the absolute risk is low. Health care providers should be aware of this rare yet serious late effect; male CCSs with symptoms potentially related to SMBC warrant careful examination."

MeSH terms included acrometastasis, carpal metastasis, hand metastasis, finger metastasis, phalangeal metastasis, and wrist metastasis. <i>Results:</i> In total, 215 studies reporting the follow-up of 247 patients were analyzed, with a median age of 62 years (range 10-91 years). Overall, 162 out of 247 patients were males (65.6%) and 85 were females (34.4%). The median reported follow-up was 5 months (range 0.5-39). The median time from primary tumor diagnosis to acrometastasis was 24 months (range 0.7-156). Acrometastases were located at the finger/phalanx (68.4%), carpal (14.2%), metacarpal (14.2%), or other sites (3.2%). The primary tumors were pulmonary in 91 patients (36.8%). The average interval from primary tumor diagnosis to acrometastasis varied according to the primary tumor type from 2 months (in patients with mesenchymal tumors) to 64.0 months (in patients with breast cancer). <i>Conclusions:</i> Acrometastases usually develop in the late stage of oncologic disease and are associated with short life expectancy. Their occurrence can no longer be considered rare; physicians should thus be updated on their surgical management and their impact on prognosis and survival."
Prospects for the primary prevention of breast cancer.,"Bernstein, Ross, Henderson","Journal Article, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S., Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1311141/,"The goal is to reduce the number of ovulatory menstrual cycles a woman experiences in order to reduce her exposure to estrogen and progesterone. Physical activity during adolescence is proposed as a nonhormonal method of accomplishing this. Tamoxifen, which is effective in breast cancer therapy, provides endocrine control of estrogen-regulated breast tumor growth.","In this paper, the rationale, stage of development, and known or potential adverse effects of three potential strategies for the prevention of breast cancer are reviewed. Two methods--the use of tamoxifen in postmenopausal women and the use of luteinizing hormone (LH)-releasing hormone agonists in premenopausal women--involve hormonal manipulation. In the premenopausal period, the goal is to reduce the number of ovulatory menstrual cycles a woman experiences in order to reduce her exposure to estrogen and progesterone. Physical activity during adolescence is proposed as a nonhormonal method of accomplishing this. The use of LH-releasing hormone agonists to produce a reversible menopause can also reduce a woman's cumulative exposure to ovarian steroid hormones. Tamoxifen, which is effective in breast cancer therapy, provides endocrine control of estrogen-regulated breast tumor growth. Breast cancer chemoprevention trials using tamoxifen among postmenopausal women have been proposed, and pilot studies are under way."

Data on women who underwent breast cancer screening at the TT Cancer Society between January 2009-December 2011(N = 2,689) were retrospectively collected. The screening detected 131 incident breast cancers; variables significantly associated with breast cancer diagnosis were, a positive family history of breast cancer (adjusted odds ratio [ORadj]: 1.55; 95% CI 1.00-2.41), presence of symptoms (ORadj: 1.91; 95% CI 1.25-2.92), and previous breast surgery (ORadj: 1.67; 95% CI 0.97-2.88). Breast cancer was significantly associated with increased breast density. Among healthy women, breast density was positively associated with nulliparity (ORadj: 1.46, 1.37, 2.52 respectively for density level 2, 3 and 4 vs. 1) and previous breast surgeries (ORadj: 2.27, 3.09 and 4.13 respectively for density level 2, 3 and 4 vs. 1). This analysis confirms that breast density is an important predictor of newly diagnosed breast cancer in this Caribbean population. Screening is still a diagnostic tool rather than a preventive measure in TT."

A diagnosis of proliferative BBD independent of other breast cancer risk factors increases the subsequent risk of breast cancer.","It is well established that exposures during childhood and adolescence affect breast cancer risk much later in life. Recently, studies have begun to evaluate whether early life exposures might also impact the risk of developing benign breast disease (BBD). A diagnosis of proliferative BBD independent of other breast cancer risk factors also increases the subsequent risk of breast cancer; therefore, understanding how to decrease the incidence of BBD may have important implications for primary breast cancer prevention. We reviewed several studies from prospective cohort studies that have investigated the relationship between risk factors during childhood and adolescence, such as anthropometric and reproductive characteristics as well as diet and other behaviors, and subsequent risk of BBD. Higher intake of vegetable oils, nuts, vitamin E, and fiber and lower consumption of animal fat, red meat, and alcohol are associated with reduced risk of BBD. Childhood weight and adolescent body mass index are inversely associated with BBD risk, whereas a greater peak height velocity during adolescence is associated with a higher risk of BBD. There was no association between age of menarche and risk of BBD. Early life exposures and behaviors appear to impact BBD risk. The current body of evidence further supports the importance of a life-course approach to breast cancer prevention."

However, there are few uniform guidelines regarding surveillance and prevention for this high-risk group. A systematic search using PUBMED and OVID MEDLINE was performed. Publications listed under the terms ""breast neoplasm"", ""neoplasm, radiation-induced"", ""therapeutic radiation-induced breast cancer"", ""screening"", ""surveillance"", ""prevention"", and ""prophylaxis"" between January 1992 and January 2015 were assessed. A total of 138 publications were reviewed. Factors associated with increased SCB risk include young age at irradiation, prolong duration since irradiation (peak relative risk 13.87 at 15-19 years postradiation), and increased radiation dose and field. Early menopause reduces SCB risk. Annual screening mammography and breast MRI is recommended from age 25 or 8 years posttreatment for women treated with â‰¥20 Gy chest radiation before age 30 years. Compared with sporadic primary breast cancers (PBC), SCB more often are bilateral (6-34 %), managed with mastectomy (56-100 %), hormone receptor-negative (27-49 %), and high-grade (35 %). Women with SCB have a similar breast cancer event-free survival and breast cancer-specific survival compared to women with PBC. However, their overall survival is worse due to comorbid conditions. There is paucity of information regarding secondary prevention of SCB. Survivors of CAYA malignancy are at risk of many late effects, including iatrogenic breast cancer from chest irradiation. They are best managed in a multidisciplinary late-effects setting where tailored risk management can be provided."

An older age at tonsillectomy, another surrogate of delayed EBV exposure, was also associated with increased risk. The implications of the findings and a potential biological mechanism are presented.","Parallel to its established causal association with both infectious mononucleosis (IM) and young adulthood Hodgkin disease (YAHD), we propose a hypothesis that ""delayed"" primary EBV infection (i.e., primary infection occurring during adolescence or adulthood) is associated with elevated breast cancer risk. We evaluated this hypothesis with two investigations, one descriptive and the other analytic. The descriptive study used international/United States cancer registry data to assess the association between incidence rates of breast cancer and those of YAHD. The incidence rates of the seemingly unrelated neoplasms were strongly correlated (correlation coefficients of 0.74 and 0.88 for international and United States data, respectively; these were higher than the correlation coefficients of YAHD with two other cancers that we considered). Populations with higher incidence rates corresponded to those with higher likelihood of delayed primary EBV infection. The analytical study was based on a population-based case-control study of breast cancer in middle-aged women. Age-adjusted odds ratios of breast cancer in women who reported a history of IM, relative to women who did not, increased monotonically from 0.55 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.05-6.17] for women with 0-9 years of age at IM onset to 2.67 (CI, 1.04-6.89) for women with > or =25 years of age at IM onset (P = 0.016). An older age at tonsillectomy, another surrogate of delayed EBV exposure, was also associated with increased risk of breast cancer: odds ratios, 0.92 (CI, 0.57-1.48) and 1.76 (CI, 1.15-2.69) for women with tonsillectomy at 0-4 years of age and > or =15 years of age, respectively (P = 0.018).

Patients with PHTS, molecularly defined as carrying germline PTEN variants, were accrued from community and academic medical centers throughout North America, South America, Europe, Australia, and Asia. Data were analyzed from July 2022 to February 2023. Review of physical and electronic medical records, and follow-up through clinical visits or telephone interviews. Lifetime cancer risks in PHTS relative to the general population. A total of 7302 patients were prospectively accrued, 701 of whom had germline PTEN variants (median [IQR] age at consent, 38 [12-52] years; 413 female patients [59%]). Longitudinal follow-up data could be obtained for 260 patients (37%), with a median (IQR) follow-up of 4 (2-8) years. Of the 701 patients, 341 (49%) received at least 1 cancer diagnosis, with 144 (42%) of those having SMN. The study found significantly elevated lifetime risks for breast (91%), endometrial (48%), thyroid (33%), kidney (30%), and colorectal cancers (17%), as well as melanoma (5%). Cancer diagnoses were also observed in children and young adults with PHTS (15%) and in patients with PHTS with neurodevelopmental disorders (11%).

Of the 341 patients with PHTS with cancer, 51 (15%) had 1 or more cancers diagnosed at age 29 years or younger, and 16 (31.4%) of those developed SMN at final follow-up. Twenty-three patients with PHTS with NDD and cancer were identified, with 5 (22%) having developed SMN at final follow-up. Individuals with PHTS and NDD showed higher lifetime cancer risks compared with individuals with PHTS but without NDD (hazard ratio, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.7-4.2; P < .001). This cohort study found consistently elevated lifetime cancer risks in PHTS. Organ-specific surveillance should continue in patients with PHTS. Additional study is required to ascertain elevated cancer risks in patients with PHTS with NDD."

The availability of genetic tests for BRCA gene mutations prompted cancer geneticists to give information about genetic risk and to assess many women with a personal or family history of breast or ovarian cancer to inform them of preventive measures. These consist mainly of breast self-examination, mammography screening, chemoprevention and prophylactic surgery (mastectomy, oophorectomy). This paper examines clinical practices related to hereditary breast cancer testing and introduces a number of results from a survey carried out, between 1996 and 1998, in three clinics located in Montreal (Quebec, Canada), Marseilles (France) and Manchester (Great Britain). Results show substantial differences in the way cancer geneticists deal with environmental risk factors, breast and ovarian cancer testing, and chemoprevention and prophylactic surgery. Differences across cities persist in the multivariate analysis, suggesting that attitudes towards preventive measures may be partially explained by cultural factors. Different dimensions of culture are discussed including the social representation of health and risk, the interpretation of scientific evidence and the role of innovation leadership."

Sixty patients aged between 18 and 50 years with an ASA I-II and scheduled for breast cancer surgery were randomized to receive either ESPB with 20 ml 0.25% bupivacaine (Standard volume ESPB), or with 40 ml 0.125% bupivacaine (High volume ESPB), or no ESPB (GA only group). The primary outcome was pain intensity evaluated by the visual analogue scale (VAS), 12 hours after surgery. P-values < 0.05 were considered the cutoff point for statistical significance. The secondary outcomes were pain at rest and pain on movement evaluated by the VAS, craniocaudal injectate spread, to paravertebral (PV) and epidural spaces assessed by CT, clinical dermatomal spread, level of sedation or agitation, and patient satisfaction with anesthesia and analgesia. VAS at rest 12 h after surgery was less in both intervention groups compared to the control (1.75 Â± 0.79 vs. 1.6 Â± 0.88 vs. 3.4 Â± 1.96, p = 0.001). The LA had extended further in the high volume group than the standard volume group (11.20 Â± 3.07 vs. 9.15 Â± 2.54 vertebral levels, p = 0.027). No difference of the spread to PV or epidural spaces between the 2 intervention groups. More dermatomes were covered in the high volume group (7.20 Â± 2.12 vs. 5.75 Â± 1.37 dermatomes, p = 0.014). Agitation was higher in the GA only group than both ESPB groups in the first 8 postoperative hours. Patients were more satisfied in both ESPB groups than the GA only group. Preoperative ESPB is an excellent analgesic modality and it can also attenuate both postoperative agitation and sedation. Doubling the injectate volume enhances the craniocaudal spreading and may be useful for surgeries requiring multiple dermatomes. However, larger volume has no effect on analgesic efficacy or patient satisfaction as there is no further spread to the PV, epidural spaces or spinal nerve rami. NCT04796363 (12/3/2021)."

Ethnic minorities have lower awareness of cancer risk factors and services, and are at greater risk of cancer mortality. While Gypsies, Roma and Travellers have poor health outcomes even in comparison with other ethnic minorities, little is known about how they view and enact primary prevention. This study takes a participatory approach to explore knowledge and experience of cancer prevention and screening in these communities. Peer researchers conducted interviews (n = 37) and a focus group (n = 4) with a purposive sample of community members in Wales and South-West England. Participants self-identified as Roma (from Slovakia and Romania) or as Gypsies, Travellers or Showpeople (here described as Gypsy/Travellers). A third of the sample were Roma, and a quarter male, with ages ranging from 18 to 77 years. Data were collected from October 2018 to March 2019. Women and men knew that lifestyle factors, such as healthy diet, stopping smoking, drinking less alcohol and using sun protection, contribute to cancer risk reduction. However, there was a widespread lack of confidence in the effectiveness of these measures, particularly in relation to smoking. Traditional cultural beliefs were shared by Roma and Gypsy/Travellers, but did not necessarily affect the behaviour of individuals. Most women participated in cervical and breast screening but few Gypsy/Traveller men would engage with bowel screening, which conflicted with community ideals of stoical masculinity. Roma participants described language barriers to screening, with confusion about differences in timing and eligibility between the UK and Slovakian programmes; this led some to access screening abroad. This study provides new knowledge about how Gypsies, Roma and Travellers keep healthy and prevent disease, giving insights into similarities and differences between ages, sexes and communities. These culturally distinct and high-need ethnic minorities have specific needs in relation to cancer prevention and screening, which merit targeted and acceptable health promotion to reduce health inequalities."

Risks of SPCs were measured as the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) and the excess absolute risk (EAR) per 10,000 person-years. Poisson regression was used to test the difference in SIRs by HR status. In comparison with the general population, the risk of new cancer diagnoses among survivors was 20% higher for those with HR-positive cancers (SIR, 1.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.19-1.21; EAR, 23.3/10,000 person-years) and 44% higher for those with HR-negative cancers (SIR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.41-1.47; EAR, 45.2/10,000 person-years), with the risk difference between HR statuses statistically significant. The higher risk after HR-negative cancer was driven by acute nonlymphocytic leukemia and breast, ovarian, peritoneal, and lung cancers. By age at diagnosis, the total EAR per 10,000 person-years ranged from 15.8 (95% CI, 14.1-17.5; SIR, 1.11) among late-onset (age, 50-84 years) HR-positive survivors to 69.4 (95% CI, 65.1-73.7; SIR, 2.24) among early-onset (age, 20-49 years) HR-negative survivors, with subsequent breast cancer representing 73% to 80% of the total EAR. After breast cancer, the greatest EARs were for ovarian cancer among early-onset HR-negative survivors, lung cancer among early- and late-onset HR-negative survivors, and uterine corpus cancer among late-onset HR-positive survivors. Risks of SPCs after breast cancer differ substantially by subtype and age. This suggests that more targeted approaches for cancer prevention and early-detection strategies are needed in survivorship care planning."

"Second Primary Cancers Following Cancer Among Adolescents and Young Adults in Queensland, Australia, 1982-2018.","Youlden, Roder, Walker, Bradford, Aitken",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36178981/,More is known about second cancers among adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors. Melanoma and female breast cancer were the most common types of second primary cancer in the study cohort. Relative risk of all second primary cancers combined among AYA patients was inversely associated with age.,"<b><i>Purpose:</i></b> Increased risk of second primary cancers is an unwanted consequence of cancer survivorship. While the epidemiology of second cancers is well-documented for children and older people, less is known about second cancers among adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Unit record data were obtained from the Queensland Cancer Register. The study cohort comprised Queensland residents aged 15 to 39 years who were diagnosed with a first primary invasive cancer between 1982 and 2013. Follow-up on second cancers was available for a minimum of 5 years to the end of 2018. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were used to approximate the risk of a second primary cancer relative to the general population. <b><i>Results:</i></b> In total, 3086 second primary cancers were observed among 34,431 eligible AYA patients (9%), equating to an overall SIR of 1.59 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.53-1.64). Melanoma (<i>n</i> = 853, 28%) and female breast cancer (<i>n</i> = 594, 19%) were the most common types of second primary cancer in the study cohort. Relative risk of all second primary cancers combined among AYA patients was inversely associated with age and was highest within the period immediately after first diagnosis irrespective of age group; for example, patients aged 15-24 at first diagnosis recorded more than four times as many second primary cancers than expected within 2 years of their first cancer (SIR = 4.40, 95% CI 2.83-6.82). <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Detailed data on second primary cancers among AYA cancer survivors are important in promoting increased awareness and to inform the development of targeted prevention and surveillance strategies."

Knowing the global incidence landscape in both sexes is critical for the breast cancer prevention and the reduction in disease burden. We retrieved the incidence data of breast cancer in both sexes from the Global Burden of Disease 2017 database. Average annual percentage change was used to quantify the temporal trends of breast cancer incidence. Between 1990 and 2017, the number of newly diagnosed female breast cancer (FBC) cases increased from 870.2 thousand to 1937.6 thousand, with the age-standardized incidence rate (ASR) significantly increased from 39.2/100,000 to 45.9/100,000. A total of 166 countries experienced a significant increase in FBC-ASR. The most pronounced increase was mainly found in developing countries. The decrease was mostly detected in several developed countries, such as the USA and the UK. Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare carcinoma and has no evident cluster across the world. Worldwide, the number of newly diagnosed MBC cases increased from 8.5 thousand in 1990 to 23.1 thousand in 2017, with the ASR significantly increased from 0.46/100,000 to 0.61/100,000. A total of 123 countries showed a significant increasing trend in MBC-ASR. Breast cancer incidence rates are increasing in most countries in both sexes, although the epidemiological features were not completely shared between FBC and MBC. More emphases should be placed on breast cancer primary prevention and the prevention strategies might need to be tailored for both FBC and MBC."

We examined associations between measured body-mass index (BMI) at age 17 years and cancer incidence, and with mortality among those who developed cancer.","Obesity has been established as a causal factor for several types of cancer, and adolescent obesity is increasing worldwide. We examined associations between measured body-mass index (BMI) at age 17 years and cancer incidence, and with mortality among those who developed cancer. In a nationwide, population-based cohort of adolescents, height and weight were measured at pre-recruitment mandatory medical examination during 1967-2010. BMI was classified according to US Center for Disease Control and Prevention percentiles. We applied Cox proportional hazard models to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for incident cases of cancer using the 5th-49th BMI percentile group as a reference. The primary outcome was any cancer diagnosis between Jan 1, 1967, and Dec 31, 2012, as recorded in the Israeli National Cancer Registry. Participants with a diagnosis of cancer at baseline (before military recruitment assessment) were excluded from this analysis. The secondary outcome of this study was all-cause mortality among cohort members who had cancer, between Jan 1, 1967, and Dec 31, 2017. Of the 2 458 170 participants examined between Jan 1, 1967, and Dec 31, 2010, 160 040 were excluded. 2 298 130 participants of which 928 110 were women and 1 370 020 were men. During 29 542 735 person-years of follow-up in men, 26 353 incident cases of cancer were recorded and in 18 044 863 person-years of follow-up in women, 29 488 incident cases of cancer were recorded. Cancer incidence increased gradually across BMI percentiles. The adjusted HR was 1Â·26 (95% CI 1Â·18-1Â·35) among men with adolescent obesity. Among women, we found no association between obesity and overall cancer, driven by inverse associations of obesity with cervical and breast cancers. When these cancers were excluded, the adjusted HR for cancer was 1Â·27 (1Â·13-1Â·44) among women with adolescent obesity. In both sexes, high BMI (â‰¥85th percentile) was associated with an increased cancer risk after 10 years. This association was accentuated in the late period of the cohort versus the early period of the cohort. BMI was positively associated with a higher risk of mortality. The projected population attributable risk for high BMI was 5Â·1% (4Â·2-6Â·1) for men and 5Â·7% (4Â·2-7Â·3) for women. The increasing prevalence of adolescent obesity and the possible association between adolescent BMI and cancer incidence might increase the future burden of obesity-related cancers. BMI among adolescents could constitute an important intervention target for cancer prevention. None."

This information is relevant to guidelines for gene panel testing and risk prediction. To characterize tumors associated with BC susceptibility genes in large-scale population- or hospital-based studies. The multicenter, international case-control analysis of the BRIDGES study included 42 680 patients and 46 387 control participants, comprising women aged 18 to 79 years who were sampled independently of family history from 38 studies.

The mean (SD) ages at interview (control participants) and diagnosis (cases) were 55.1 (11.9) and 55.8 (10.6) years, respectively; all participants were of European or East Asian ethnicity. There was substantial heterogeneity in the distribution of intrinsic subtypes by gene. RAD51C, RAD51D, and BARD1 variants were associated mainly with triple-negative disease (OR, 6.19 [95% CI, 3.17-12.12]; OR, 6.19 [95% CI, 2.99-12.79]; and OR, 10.05 [95% CI, 5.27-19.19], respectively). CHEK2 variants were associated with all subtypes (with ORs ranging from 2.21-3.17) except for triple-negative disease. For ATM variants, the association was strongest for the hormone receptor (HR)+ERBB2- high-grade subtype (OR, 4.99; 95% CI, 3.68-6.76). BRCA1 was associated with increased risk of all subtypes, but the ORs varied widely, being highest for triple-negative disease (OR, 55.32; 95% CI, 40.51-75.55). BRCA2 and PALB2 variants were also associated with triple-negative disease. TP53 variants were most strongly associated with HR+ERBB2+ and HR-ERBB2+ subtypes. Tumors occurring in pathogenic variant carriers were of higher grade. For most genes and subtypes, a decline in ORs was observed with increasing age. Together, the 9 genes were associated with 27.3% of all triple-negative tumors in women 40 years or younger. The results of this case-control study suggest that variants in the 9 BC risk genes differ substantially in their associated pathology but are generally associated with triple-negative and/or high-grade disease. Knowing the age and tumor subtype distributions associated with individual BC genes can potentially aid guidelines for gene panel testing, risk prediction, and variant classification and guide targeted screening strategies."

Loperamide and octreotide are frequently used to treat CID after diarrhea occurs, but neither is used prophylactically or targets the underlying mechanism. Previous studies suggest blocking epidermal growth factor receptor may cause excess chloride secretion, resulting in diarrhea. Crofelemer is derived from the red latex of the Croton lechleri tree, blocks gastrointestinal cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator and calcium-activated chloride channels, and is U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved for relief of diarrhea in HIV/AIDS patients on anti-retroviral therapy.

We investigated the risks of specific subsequent primary neoplasms after each of 16 types of AYA cancer. The Teenage and Young Adult Cancer Survivor Study is a population-based cohort of 200 945 survivors of cancer diagnosed when aged 15-39 years in England and Wales from Jan 1, 1971, to Dec 31, 2006. The cohort was established using cancer registrations from the Office for National Statistics and the Welsh Cancer registry. Follow-up was from 5-year survival until the first occurrence of death, emigration, or study end date (Dec 31, 2012). In this analysis, we focus on the risk of specific subsequent primary neoplasms after 16 types of AYA cancer: breast; cervical; testicular; Hodgkin lymphoma (female); Hodgkin lymphoma (male); melanoma; CNS (intracranial); colorectal; non-Hodgkin lymphoma; thyroid; soft-tissue sarcoma; ovarian; bladder; other female genital; leukaemia; and head and neck cancer. We report absolute excess risks (AERs; per 10 000 person-years) and cumulative incidence of specific types of subsequent primary neoplasm after each type of AYA cancer. During the 2 631 326 person-years of follow-up (median follow-up 16Â·8 years, IQR 10Â·5-25Â·2), 12 321 subsequent primary neoplasms were diagnosed in 11 565 survivors, most frequently among survivors of breast cancer, cervical cancer, testicular cancer, and Hodgkin lymphoma. AERs of any subsequent primary neoplasms were 19Â·5 per 10 000 person-years (95% CI 17Â·4-21Â·5) in survivors of breast cancer, 10Â·2 (8Â·0-12Â·4) in survivors of cervical cancer, 18Â·9 (16Â·6-21Â·1) in survivors of testicular cancer, 55Â·7 (50Â·4-61Â·1) in female survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma, and 29Â·9 (26Â·3-33Â·6) in male survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma. The cumulative incidence of all subsequent primary neoplasms 35 years after diagnosis was 11Â·9% (95% CI 11Â·3-12Â·6) in survivors of breast cancer, 15Â·8% (14Â·8-16Â·7) in survivors of cervical cancer, 20Â·2% (18Â·9-21Â·5) in survivors of testicular cancer, 26Â·6% (24Â·7-28Â·6) in female survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma, and 16Â·5% (15Â·2-18Â·0) in male survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma. In patients who had survived at least 30 years from diagnosis of cervical cancer, testicular cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma in women, breast cancer, and Hodgkin lymphoma in men, we identified a small number of specific subsequent primary neoplasms that account for 82%, 61%, 58%, 45%, and 41% of the total excess number of neoplasms, respectively. Lung cancer accounted for a notable proportion of the excess number of neoplasms across all AYA groups investigated. Our finding that a small number of specific subsequent primary neoplasms account for a large percentage of the total excess number of neoplasms in long-term survivors of cervical, breast, and testicular cancer, and Hodgkin lymphoma provides an evidence base to inform priorities for clinical long-term follow-up. The prominence of lung cancer after each of these AYA cancers indicates the need for further work aimed at preventing and reducing the burden of this cancer in future survivors of AYA cancer.

The aim of PHEs is to identify risk factors and early signs of disease, but also to prevent future illness by early intervention. Therefore, each PHE should include counselling, immunisation and physical examination according to the patient's age and gender. However, deciding whether to screen a patient and choosing the most appropriate screening method can be challenging for general practitioners.

The aim of this review is to provide an updated statement of recommendations regarding preventive care measures based mostly on the guidelines derived from the USPSTF and the Swiss Medical Board. Among the major updates, there is no recommendation anymore to routinely screen for breast cancer and prostate cancer in asymptomatic adults. Since 2013, however, the USPSTF recommends annual screening for lung cancer with low-dose CT in patients aged 55 to 80 years with a smoking history of â‰¥30 pack years. During PHEs, the physician should be alert to the patients' hidden agendas, which are the reason for one third of all consultations in primary care."

We investigated associations between miRNA related SNPs and breast cancer risk. First we evaluated 2,196 SNPs in a case-control study combining nine genome wide association studies (GWAS). Second, we further investigated 42 SNPs with suggestive evidence for association using 41,785 cases and 41,880 controls from 41 studies included in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC). Combining the GWAS and BCAC data within a meta-analysis, we estimated main effects on breast cancer risk as well as risks for estrogen receptor (ER) and age defined subgroups. Five miRNA binding site SNPs associated significantly with breast cancer risk: rs1045494 (odds ratio (OR) 0.92; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.88-0.96), rs1052532 (OR 0.97; 95% CI: 0.95-0.99), rs10719 (OR 0.97; 95% CI: 0.94-0.99), rs4687554 (OR 0.97; 95% CI: 0.95-0.99, and rs3134615 (OR 1.03; 95% CI: 1.01-1.05) located in the 3' UTR of CASP8, HDDC3, DROSHA, MUSTN1, and MYCL1, respectively. DROSHA belongs to miRNA machinery genes and has a central role in initial miRNA processing. The remaining genes are involved in different molecular functions, including apoptosis and gene expression regulation. Further studies are warranted to elucidate whether the miRNA binding site SNPs are the causative variants for the observed risk effects."

This research has formed the basis for dietary guidance issued by cancer organizations. Unfortunately, gaps within nutrition research have made it difficult to make recommendations in some areas. This review specifies suggested dietary guidance in which evidence of a dietary influence on cancer risk is substantial, even if not conclusive. Evidence summaries within the review are based on the 2007 report of the World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research. This review also describes advantages and disadvantages of following the suggested dietary guidance and includes putative mechanisms involved in cancer progression. Suggested dietary guidance where evidence is sufficiently compelling include (1) limiting or avoiding dairy products to reduce the risk of prostate cancer; (2) limiting or avoiding alcohol to reduce the risk of cancers of the mouth, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, colon, rectum, and breast; (3) avoiding red and processed meat to reduce the risk of cancers of the colon and rectum; (4) avoiding grilled, fried, and broiled meats to reduce the risk of cancers of the colon, rectum, breast, prostate, kidney, and pancreas; (5) consumption of soy products during adolescence to reduce the risk of breast cancer in adulthood and to reduce the risk of recurrence and mortality for women previously treated for breast cancer; and (6) emphasizing fruits and vegetables to reduce risk of several common forms of cancer. By adopting the precautionary principle for nutrition research, this review aims to serve as a useful tool for practitioners and patients."

The long-term sequela of responses to early exposures may impact other adult morbidities; addressing these exposures represents an important challenge for contemporary medicine."
Prediagnostic breast milk DNA methylation alterations in women who develop breast cancer.,"Salas, Lundgren, Browne, Punska, Anderton, Karagas, Arcaro, Christensen","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31943067/,DNA methylation was assessed using Illumina HumanMethylation450k in 87 breast milk samples. Nearly all CpG sites associated with a breast cancer diagnosis were hypomethylated in cases compared with controls. Cases exhibited increased estimated epigenetic mitotic tick rate.,"Prior candidate gene studies have shown tumor suppressor DNA methylation in breast milk related with history of breast biopsy, an established risk factor for breast cancer. To further establish the utility of breast milk as a tissue-specific biospecimen for investigations of breast carcinogenesis, we measured genome-wide DNA methylation in breast milk from women with and without a diagnosis of breast cancer in two independent cohorts. DNA methylation was assessed using Illumina HumanMethylation450k in 87 breast milk samples. Through an epigenome-wide association study we explored CpG sites associated with a breast cancer diagnosis in the prospectively collected milk samples from the breast that would develop cancer compared with women without a diagnosis of breast cancer using linear mixed effects models adjusted for history of breast biopsy, age, RefFreeCellMix cell estimates, time of delivery, array chip and subject as random effect. We identified 58 differentially methylated CpG sites associated with a subsequent breast cancer diagnosis (q-value <0.05). Nearly all CpG sites associated with a breast cancer diagnosis were hypomethylated in cases compared with controls and were enriched for CpG islands. In addition, inferred repeat element methylation was lower in breast milk DNA from cases compared to controls, and cases exhibited increased estimated epigenetic mitotic tick rate as well as DNA methylation age compared with controls. Breast milk has utility as a biospecimen for prospective assessment of disease risk, for understanding the underlying molecular basis of breast cancer risk factors and improving primary and secondary prevention of breast cancer."

Premature ovarian insufficiency and neurological function.,"Soni, Hogervorst","Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24942013/,Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) involves loss of ovarian function before age 40. POI has been associated with neurological dysfunction and an increased risk of dementia. Findings related to loss of cognitive function after chemotherapy or GnRH treatments are mixed.,"Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) involves loss of ovarian function before age 40. POI has been associated with neurological dysfunction and an increased risk of dementia, perhaps due to depletion in estrogen levels. The present review discusses the effects of POI caused by genetic disorder, natural premature menopause, surgical menopause, breast cancer treatment and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist treatment. Overall, data suggest an increased risk of neurological disorder where POI is due to premature menopause or induced from surgery. This increased risk appears to be most apparent on domains of global cognitive and verbal memory tests. Where POI is caused by genetic disorder, observed cognitive deficiencies may be more likely to have a genetic basis rather than being due to the effects of sex steroids on the brain. Findings related to loss of cognitive function after chemotherapy or GnRH treatments are mixed. There are also discrepant data related to use of hormone therapy after POI (particularly after surgical menopause). After surgery, hormone treatment appears to be most beneficial if initiated close to the average natural age of menopause."
Physical activity in adolescence and young adulthood and breast cancer risk: a quantitative review.,"Lagerros, Hsieh, Hsieh","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15075782/,Physical activity in 12-24-year-old females significantly reduces risk of breast cancer.

Our objective of this quantitative review was to provide a summary estimate of the association of moderate/vigorous recreational physical activity during adolescence/young adulthood with breast cancer risk, and to determine whether a dose-response relationship exists. Data sources included studies in humans relating physical activity to breast cancer risk, published between January 1966 and October 2002, identified on Medline, the Web of Science, from reference lists and related reviews. The main characteristics of each study, the point estimates of relative risk (RR) and confidence intervals (CI) were extracted from 19 case-control and four cohort studies. Comparing the highest to the lowest category of physical activity, the summary RR from the random effects model was 0.81 (95% CI 0.73-0.89). This almost 20% risk reduction proved to be fairly consistent, despite variation in populations and methods. Each one-hour increase of recreational physical activity/week during adolescence was associated with a 3% (95% CI 0-6%) risk reduction. Physical activity in 12-24-year-old females significantly reduces risk of breast cancer. Heterogeneity may be explained by different methods to measure activity."

The female resident population aged 15 years or older, by age group and municipality, in 2009 (mid-term), obtained from public dataset (Informatics Department of the Unified Health System). Women 15 years or older who died of breast cancer in the SSP were selected for the calculation of the breast cancer mortality rate, according to the municipality and age group, from 2006 to 2012. Mortality rates for each municipality calculated by the direct standardisation method, using the age structure of the population of SSP in 2009 as the standard. In the final linear regression model, breast cancer mortality, in the municipal level, was directly associated with rates of nulliparity (p<0.0001), mammography (p<0.0001) and private healthcare (p=0.006). The findings that mammography ratio was associated, in the municipal level, with increased mortality add to the evidence of a probable overestimation of benefits and underestimation of risks associated with this form of screening. The same paradoxical trend of increased mortality with screening was found in recent individual-level studies, indicating the need to expand informed choice for patients, primary prevention actions and individualised screening. Additional studies should be conducted to explore if there is a causality link in this association."

Breast cancer mothers communicated risk and secondary prevention with early detection by breast self-examination and mammograms whereas the melanoma mothers communicated risk and primary prevention strategies like applying sunscreen and avoiding deliberate tanning. Open communication about health matters significantly increased the likelihood that children engaged in early detection and/or primary prevention behaviors. Examining the information conveyed to at-risk family members, and whether such information motivated them to engage in early detection/prevention behaviors, is key to guiding better cancer prevention communication between doctors and patients."

A within-subject-control-group design was used to compare changes before the intervention (measurements Pre1-Pre2) to changes during the intervention (measurements Pre2-Post) via dependent one-sided t-tests. Additional exploratory analyses for further outcome variables were performed. Changes during the intervention period were significantly greater than changes during the waiting period for all primary outcome measures (mothers' emotional functioning: p < 0.0001; children's psychological health: p = 0.0035; and children's emotional symptoms: p = 0.0005). Data suggest that the family-oriented intervention 'getting well together' seems to be beneficial to mothers' and children's quality of life and psychological well-being. Combining oncological rehabilitation and preventive child-centered interventions might be a feasible approach to supporting breast cancer patients and their children and improving their emotional state.

This reflects the breast cancer mortality declines due to access to screening and effective treatment alongside the entrance of certain countries in stages of the tobacco epidemic in which smoking becomes more prevalent in women. In this study, we project lung and breast cancer mortality until 2030 in 52 countries. Cancer mortality data were obtained from the WHO Mortality Database. Age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR), per 100,000, were calculated (direct method) for 2008 to 2014 and projected for the years 2015, 2020, 2025, and 2030 using a Bayesian log-linear Poisson model. In 52 countries studied around the world, between 2015 and 2030, the median ASMR are projected to increase for lung cancer, from 11.2 to 16.0, whereas declines are expected for breast cancer, from 16.1 to 14.7. In the same period, the ASMR will decrease in 36 countries for breast cancer and in 15 countries for lung cancer. In half of the countries analyzed, and in nearly three quarters of those classified as high-income countries, the ASMR for lung cancer has already surpassed or will surpass the breast cancer ASMR before 2030. The mortality for lung and breast cancer is higher in high-income countries than in middle-income countries; lung cancer mortality is lower in the latter because the tobacco epidemic is not yet widespread. Due to these observed characteristics of lung cancer, primary prevention should still be a key factor to decrease lung cancer mortality.<b>Significance:</b> The mortality for lung and breast cancer is projected to be higher in high-income countries than in middle-income countries, where lung cancer mortality is expected to surpass breast cancer mortality before 2030. <i>Cancer Res; 78(15); 4436-42.

This study aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the cancer burden and trends in Yemen for 2020, including incidence and mortality rates. The current study provides cancer statistics and their trends in Yemen, including incidence and mortality, in 2020 by using descriptive statistics. The data was obtained using the Global Cancer Observatory (GCO) 2020 online database. According to the (GCP) database in 2020, the crude incidence rate (CIR) of all cancers in Yemen was 55.2 per 100.000. The age-standardized rate (ASR) was 97.0 per 100.000, and the cumulative risk (0-74) was 22.0 per 100.000. The age-standardized rate (ASR) was 76.5 per 100.000, and the cumulative risk (0-74) was 19.6 per 100.000. Furthermore, the crude mortality rate (CIR) of all cancers was 40.6 per 100.000. Breast cancer was most prevalent in Yemen across all age groups and genders (31.1%), followed by colorectal cancer (7.7%) and leukemia (5.7%). Breast cancer also ranked as the primary cause of mortality at an estimated percentage of 13.5%, followed by colorectal cancer (8.8%) and stomach cancer (7.1%). Cancer has become a significant life-threatening illness in Yemen with an increase in the disease burden of breast cancer in women. Furthermore, leukemia in children and colorectal cancer in both sexes have experienced a more significant burden as well. Therefore, it is imperative for initiatives for cancer control and prevention to be prioritised at national and regional levels."

This descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted with 240 women aged from 15 to 65 years admitted to a gynecology-obstetrics outpatient clinic of a private hospital in Gaziantep. Study data were collected by the investigators through a 36-item questionnaire form which was generated using information gathered from similar surveys in the literature. It was determined that 34.6% of women were high-school graduates, and 64.2% had a medium income level.

Some 79.2% did not know what a Pap smear was and 73.3% had not experienced a smear test ever. In this study, we found that most of the women had insufficient knowledge of breast and cervical cancer, while knowledge and practices increased with the education level. Based on these findings, we suggest that there is a need for planning, implementation and assessment of health policies and healthcare services at the national and regional level and we believe that nurses working in the field of protective health services should develop educational programmes for women with a primary focus on cancer in order to increase awareness among the female population in Turkey."

Additionally, this study investigated the effect of prolonged breastfeeding on the allergic diseases in a developing country. This is a cross sectional survey. Well baby clinics and Pediatric clinics in the 11 Primary Health Care Centers and Hamad General Hospital, Hamad Medical Corporation, State of Qatar. A multistage sampling design was used and a representative sample of 1500 Qatari infants and pre-school children with age range of 0-5 years and mothers aged between 18 to 47 years were surveyed during the period from October 2006 to September 2007 in Qatar. Out of the 1500 mothers of children, 1278 mothers agreed to participate in this study with the response rate of 85.2%. A confidential, anonymous questionnaire was completed by the selected subjects assessing breastfeeding and allergic diseases. Questionnaires were administered to women who were attending Primary Health Centers for child immunization. Questionnaire included allergic rhinitis, wheezing, eczema, and additional questions included mode and duration of breastfeeding, tobacco smoke exposure, number of siblings, family income, level of maternal education, parental history of allergies. Univariate and multivariate statistical methods were performed for statistical analysis. More than half of the infants (59.3%) were exclusively breastfed, followed by infants with partial breastfeeding (28.3%) and artificial fed (12.4%). There was a significant difference found across these three categories of infants in terms of their age groups, smoking status of father, socio-economic status and parental consanguinity. Asthma (15.6%), wheezing (12.7%), allergic rhinitis (22.6%), and eczema (19.4%) were less frequent in exclusive breast fed children, compared to infants with partial breast feeding and formula milk. Ear infection (P = 0.0001) and eczema (P = 0.007) were found significant in infants with the history of maternal atopy, while asthma (P = 0.0001) and allergic rhinitis (P = 0.015) were found significant in infants with the history of paternal atopy. The main factors associated with mode of feeding were mothers having first baby, asthmatic mother and parental history of allergic rhinitis. The risk of allergic diseases, eczema, wheeze and ear infection in particular, were lower in children with prolonged breast feeding (>6 months) than in those with short-term breast feeding duration (<6 months). The current study indicates that exclusive breast-feeding prevents development of allergic diseases in children. The main factors associated with breastfeeding for allergic diseases were being the first baby, maternal history of asthma, and parental history of allergic rhinitis. The study findings opens a big avenue for interventional role of breastfeeding. Therefore, we recommend breastfeeding is as one possible way to reduce the risk of onset asthma and allergic diseases in developing countries."
Best practice & research clinical haematology: Screening for breast cancer in hodgkin lymphoma survivors.,Wong,"Journal Article, Review, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38092481/,"breast cancer risk is felt to originate from chest wall radiation exposure prior to the third decade of life. Women with a history of chest radiation for Hodgkin lymphoma are counselled to begin screening with bilateral breast MRI at 25 years of age, or eight years after radiation.","Childhood and young adult survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma are at an elevated risk of developing breast cancer. Breast cancer risk is felt to originate from chest wall radiation exposure prior to the third decade of life, with incidence beginning to rise approximately eight to ten years following Hodgkin lymphoma treatment. Although incidence varies according to age at radiation exposure, dosage, and treatment fields, cohort studies have documented a cumulative incidence of breast cancer of 10-20% by 40 years of age. Women with a history of chest radiation for Hodgkin lymphoma are counselled to begin screening with bilateral breast MRI at 25 years of age, or eight years after radiation, whichever occurs later. Outside of high-risk surveillance, the optimal management approach for women with prior radiation exposure continues to evolve. When diagnosed with breast malignancy, evidence supports consideration of unilateral therapeutic and contralateral prophylactic mastectomy, although breast conserving surgery may be considered following multidisciplinary assessment. This review will address the epidemiology, characteristics, screening and management guidelines, and breast-cancer prevention efforts for Hodgkin lymphoma survivors treated with radiation therapy in adolescence and young adulthood."

This study assessed the risk of subsequent malignant neoplasms (SMNs) to identify the most common SMNs to be considered in follow-up care. Population-based cancer registries retrospectively identified first primary tumors (between 1976 and 2013) and SMNs in AYAs (15-39 years old at their cancer diagnosis). AYA cancer survivors were those alive at least 5 years after their first cancer diagnosis. The excess risk of SMNs was measured as standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and absolute excess risk together with the cumulative incidence of SMNs. The cohort included 67,692 AYA cancer survivors. The excess risk of developing any SMN (SIR, 1.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-1.7) was 60%. The excess risk of SMNs was significantly high for survivors of lymphomas; cancers of the breast, thyroid, female genital tract, digestive organs, gonads, and urinary tract; and melanomas. The cumulative incidence of all SMNs in AYA cancer survivors within 25 years of their first cancer diagnosis was approximately 10%. Subsequent tumors contributing to approximately 60% of all SMNs were breast cancer, colorectal cancer, corpus uteri cancer, and ovarian cancer in females and colorectal cancer, bladder cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, and lymphomas in males.

Opposite trends were observed in the mortality rates of high and low SDI countries.,"Disparities in the global burden of breast cancer have been identified. We aimed to investigate recent patterns and trends in the breast cancer incidence and associated mortality. We also assessed breast cancer-related health inequalities according to socioeconomic development factors. An observational study based on the Global Burden of Diseases. Estimates of breast cancer incidence and mortality during 1990-2016 were obtained from the Global Health Data Exchange database. Subsequently, data obtained in 2016 were described using the age-standardised and age-specific incidence, mortality and mortality-to-incidence (MI) ratios according to sociodemographic index (SDI) levels. Trends were assessed by measuring the annual percent change using the joinpoint regression. The Gini coefficients and concentration indices were used to identify between-country inequalities. Countries with higher SDI levels had worse disease incidence burdens in 2016, whereas inequalities in the breast cancer incidence had decreased since 1990. Opposite trends were observed in the mortality rates of high and low SDI countries. Moreover, the decreasing concentration indices, some of which became negative, among women aged 15-49 and 50-69 years suggested an increase in the mortality burdens in undeveloped regions. Conversely, inequality related to the MI ratio increased. In 2016, the MI ratios exhibited distinct gradients from high to low SDI regions across all age groups. The patterns and trends in breast cancer incidence and mortality closely correlated with the SDI levels. Our findings highlighted the primary prevention of breast cancer in high SDI countries with a high disease incidence and the development of cost-effective diagnostic and treatment interventions for low SDI countries with poor MI ratios as the two pressing needs in the next decades."

However, the association between tumor markers (CA15-3, CA125, and CEA) and breast cancer survival among certain molecular subtypes is unclear; we described this association in a large, population-based study. We conducted a cohort study including 10,836 women according to the Tianjin Breast Cancer Cases Cohort. Demographic and epidemiologic data were collected by a structured face-to-face questionnaire. Clinico-pathological parameters were abstracted from medical records, and follow-up information was obtained once a year by telephone. The primary endpoints were breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) and disease-free survival (DFS). We utilized the Cox proportional hazard model to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Among all patients, elevated CA15-3 and CEA exhibited consistently and statistically significant reduced BCSS compared with normal ones (CA15-3: HR 1.54, 95% CI 1.01-2.34; CEA: HR 2.45, 95% CI 1.40-4.30).

Preoperative CA15-3 and CEA levels differ in breast cancer molecular subtypes and yield strong prognostic information in Chinese women with breast cancer. Measuring CA15-3 and CEA levels before surgery may have the potential in predicting breast cancer survival and offering patients' personalized treatment strategy among luminal A and basal-like subtypes."

Different rules for registering multiple primary cancers (MP) are used by cancer registries throughout the world making data comparisons difficult. We evaluated the effect of SEER and IARC/IACR rules on cancer incidence rates and trends using data from the SEER Program. We estimated age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) and trends (1975-2011) for the top 26 cancer categories using joinpoint regression analysis. ASIRs were higher using SEER compared to IARC/IACR rules for all cancers combined (3 %) and, in rank order, melanoma (9 %), female breast (7 %), urinary bladder (6 %), colon (4 %), kidney and renal pelvis (4 %), oral cavity and pharynx (3 %), lung and bronchus (2 %), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (2 %). ASIR differences were largest for patients aged 65+ years. Trends were similar using both MP rules with the exception of cancers of the urinary bladder, and kidney and renal pelvis. The choice of multiple primary coding rules effects incidence rates and trends. Compared to SEER MP coding rules, IARC/IACR rules are less complex, have not changed over time, and report fewer multiple primary cancers, particularly cancers that occur in paired organs, at the same anatomic site and with the same or related histologic type. Cancer registries collecting incidence data using SEER rules may want to consider including incidence rates and trends using IARC/IACR rules to facilitate international data comparisons."

There was no clear relationship between any prostate cancer treatment and subsequent colorectal cancer risk, location or timing. In the modern era, there is an increased rate of colorectal cancer diagnosis in years shortly following another common cancer history. This is consistently seen across different primary tumour streams including prostate, breast and lung cancers and in part contributed by screen detected and incidental colorectal cancer diagnoses. Future studies should consider this potential confounding factor when asserting an increased rate of colorectal cancer as a second primary cancer."

Efforts are needed to translate global recommendations into national guidelines and implementation strategies. This article presents the current status of policy guidance for the use of PrEP during peri-conception, pregnancy and breastfeeding, with a particular focus on high prevalence countries, including those in sub-Saharan Africa. PrEP clinical guidelines released by ministries of health or other national-level health bodies, with a particular focus on recommendations for PrEP use during peri-conception, pregnancy and breastfeeding, were reviewed and summarised. Among countries with PrEP guidelines and/or policy, pregnancy is recognised as a period with increased HIV vulnerability, and some recommend PrEP use specifically during pregnancy. Only one country notes that PrEP is contraindicated during pregnancy, recognising a gap in complete safety data from women using PrEP throughout pregnancy. PrEP is not contraindicated as a peri-conception HIV prevention strategy in any country, but only three countries have specific guidance for peri-conception HIV prevention. Multiple barriers to the implementation of PrEP during pregnancy and breastfeeding are discussed, including barriers at the policy, health systems, social and personal levels. Although pregnancy is a period of heightened risk and fertility rates are high in many settings with high HIV burden, few PrEP policies have included guidance for PrEP use specific to peri-conception, pregnancy and breastfeeding periods. This gap can be overcome by the development or adoption of national clinical guidelines and implementation strategies from exemplary countries."
Opening the Conversation: study protocol for a Phase III trial to evaluate a couple-based intervention to reduce reproductive and sexual distress among young adult breast and gynecologic cancer survivor couples.,"Gorman, Lyons, Harvey, Acquati, Salsman, Kashy, Drizin, Smith, Flexner, Hayes-Lattin, Reese","Clinical Trial Protocol, Journal Article",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36056413/,Reproductive and sexual health (RSH) concerns are common and distressing for young adults diagnosed with breast and gynecologic cancer and their partners. This study evaluates the efficacy of a virtual couple-based intervention called Opening the Conversation.,"Reproductive and sexual health (RSH) concerns are common and distressing for young adults diagnosed with breast and gynecologic cancer and their partners. This study evaluates the efficacy of a virtual couple-based intervention called Opening the Conversation (OC). The OC intervention is grounded in theory and evidence-based practice and was adapted to improve coping and communication specifically in relation to RSH concerns after cancer. This Phase III trial is conducted in a fully remote setting and enrolls young adult couples (current age 18-44 years) with a history of breast or gynecologic cancer (stage 1-4, diagnosed under age 40) within the past 6 months to 5 years. Eligible dyads are recruited from across the USA. The target sample size is 100 couples. Dyads are randomly assigned to receive either the 5-session OC intervention or a 4-session active control intervention (Side by Side). The primary outcomes are change in reproductive distress and sexual distress. Secondary outcomes include communication about reproductive concerns, communication about sexual concerns, depressive symptoms, sexual function, relationship quality, relationship intimacy, sexual satisfaction, self-efficacy to communicate about sex and intimacy, and quality of life. An exploratory aim examines whether dyadic coping and communication quality mediate intervention effects on survivors' and partners' reproductive distress or sexual distress. Self-report outcome measures are assessed for both groups at baseline (T1), 2 weeks post-treatment (T2), and 3 months post-treatment (T3). Despite the importance of RSH for quality of life for young adult cancer survivors and their partners, evidence-based interventions that help couples navigate RSH concerns are lacking. This randomized controlled trial will determine the efficacy of a novel couple-based intervention to reduce distress related to RSH concerns for younger couples after breast or gynecologic cancer, in comparison to an active control intervention.

No difference in adherence to pathologic guidelines was identified between the 2 provider groups.,"Risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy reduces mortality from high-grade serous carcinoma in patients with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer associated gene mutations. Ideal surgical management includes 5 steps outlined in 2005 by the Society of Gynecologic Oncology and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. In addition, it is recommended that pathologic examination include serial sectioning of specimens. In practice, risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy is performed by both gynecologic oncologists and general gynecologists. To ensure optimal detection of occult malignancy, standardized adherence to outlined guidelines is necessary. This study aimed to evaluate the adherence to optimal surgical and pathologic examination guidelines and to compare the rate of occult malignancy at the time of surgery between 2 provider types. Institutional review board exemption was obtained. A retrospective review of patients undergoing risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy without hysterectomy from October 1, 2015, to December 31, 2020, at 3 sites within a healthcare system was conducted. The inclusion criteria included age â‰¥18 years and a documented indication for surgery being a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 or a strong family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer. Compliance with 5 surgical steps and pathologic specimen preparation was based on medical record documentation. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine differences in adherence between provider groups and surgical and pathologic examination guidelines. A P value of <.025 was considered statistically significant for the 2 primary outcomes after Bonferroni correction was applied to adjust for multiple comparisons. A total of 185 patients were included. Among the 96 cases performed by gynecologic oncologists, 69 (72%) performed all 5 steps of surgery, 22 (23%) performed 4 steps, 5 (5%) performed 3 steps, and none performed 1 or 2 steps. Among the 89 cases performed by general gynecologists, 4 (5%) performed all 5 steps, 33 (37%) performed 4 steps, 38 (43%) performed 3 steps, 13 (15%) performed 2 steps, and 1 (1%) performed 1 step. Gynecologic oncologists were more likely to document adherence to all 5 recommended surgical steps in their surgical dictation (odds ratio, 54.3; 95% confidence interval, 18.1-162.7; P<.0001). Among the 96 cases documented by gynecologic oncologists, 41 (43%) had serial sectioning of all specimens performed, compared with 23 of 89 cases (26%) performed by general gynecologists. No difference in adherence to pathologic guidelines was identified between the 2 provider groups (P=.0489; note: P value of >.025). Overall, 5 patients (2.70%) had occult malignancy diagnosed at the time of risk-reducing surgery, with all surgeries performed by general gynecologists. Our results demonstrated greater compliance with surgical guidelines for risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in gynecologic oncologists than in general gynecologists. No considerable difference was determined between the 2 provider types in adherence to pathologic guidelines. Our findings demonstrated a need for institution-wide protocol education and implementation of standardized nomenclature to ensure provider adherence to evidence-based guidelines."
Sustained and Boosted Antibody Responses in Breast Milk After Maternal SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination.,"Ware, McElhinney, Latham, Lane, Dienger-Stambaugh, Hildeman, Spearman, Ware","Clinical Study, Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37615566/,Pregnant and lactating women were not included in the initial large vaccine clinical trials for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID) infection.

Delineating the antibody titers in serum and breast milk of lactating women is important to determine the safety and benefits of vaccination in this special population. <b><i>Objective:</i></b> To investigate COVID vaccinations in breastfeeding dyads and effects on lactation, the Antibody Detection of Vaccine-Induced Secretory Effects trial (ADVISE) prospectively evaluated anti-COVID antibodies in serum and breast milk after initial paired and booster vaccines. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> This is a prospective longitudinal surveillance cohort study of lactating women. Eligibility criteria included â‰¥18 years of age, currently lactating, and at enrollment either received COVID vaccination within the past 60 days or planning vaccination within 60 days. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Among 63 lactating mothers, COVID vaccination led to breast milk secretory IgA (sIgA) and IgG antibodies with consistent viral neutralizing activity. Milk sIgA titers increased further after second vaccination and were prolonged after a third booster dose, including women with extended breastfeeding beyond 12 months. Milk IgG antibody titers were higher and more sustained than sIgA. Antibody titers were not associated with individual dyad characteristics or vaccine manufacturer. Vaccine-induced antibodies from milk were not detected in infant circulation. <b><i>Conclusions and Relevance:</i></b> Maternal COVID vaccination during lactation is well tolerated and generates sustained and boosted antibody responses in breast milk. COVID-specific sIgA and IgG antibodies with neutralizing activity are found in breast milk, including boosted mothers who continue breastfeeding beyond 12 months. These data support universal COVID vaccinations for all lactating mothers, including booster immunizations during extended breastfeeding (NCT04895475)."

Therefore, we aimed to describe cancer-related knowledge in Portugal, including perception of risk, awareness of cancer causes and preventive behaviours. We evaluated 1624 Portuguese-speaking dwellers, aged between 16 and 79 years, through face-to-face interviews conducted using a structured questionnaire. We computed adjusted (sex, age, education) regression coefficients and prevalence ratios, using linear and Poisson regression, respectively, to quantify associations with cancer-specific knowledge. The proportions of nonresponse ranged from 13.4 to 63.5% for the most frequent cancer in Portugal and the leading cause of cancer, respectively. The mean of the estimated lifetime risk of cancer in the Portuguese population was 37.0%. A total of 47.5% of the respondents identified breast cancer as the most frequent in Portugal, 72.0% named lifestyles as the leading cause of cancer and 40.2% selected not smoking as the most important preventive behaviour. Lower levels of education were associated with higher proportions of nonresponse, but not consistently with inaccurate knowledge. Men provided lower estimates of the lifetime risk of cancer, indicated breast cancer less frequently and more often lung cancer as the most frequent, and were more likely to select not smoking as the most important preventive behaviour. The present study provides relevant data on knowledge of cancer prevention, which may be used for the planning and evaluation of awareness-raising and primary prevention interventions in Portugal."

This multicenter study aimed to define the optimum treatment strategy and patterns of failure for PB-DLBCL patients. We retrospectively reviewed data on 108 PB-DLBCL patients from 21 Chinese medical centers. Only patients with localized disease (involvement of breast and localized lymph nodes) were included. After a median follow-up of 3.2 years, 32% of patients developed progression or relapse. A continuous pattern of relapse was observed, characterized by frequent late relapses in the contralateral breast and central nervous system (CNS). Although rituximab significantly reduced the overall cumulative risk of progression or relapse (5-year cumulative risk 57% vs 24%, P = .029), it had limited effect on the reduction of breast relapse (P = .46). Consolidative radiotherapy significantly decreased the risk of breast relapse, even in the subgroup of patients treated with rituximab (5-year cumulative risk 21.2% vs 0%, P = .012). A continuous risk of CNS progression or relapse up to 8.2 years from diagnosis was observed (10-year cumulative risk 28.3%), with a median time to CNS relapse of 3.1 years. Neither rituximab nor prophylactic intrathecal chemotherapy significantly decreased the risk of CNS relapse. In summary, our study indicates that PB-DLBCL has a continuous pattern of relapse, especially with frequent late relapses in the CNS and contralateral breast. Rituximab and RT confer complementary benefit in the reduction of relapse. However, neither the addition of rituximab nor prophylactic intrathecal chemotherapy could effectively prevent CNS relapse for PB-DLBCL patients."
Testicular versus breast and colorectal cancer screening: early detection practices of primary care physicians.,"Misener, Fuller","Comparative Study, Journal Article",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7663550/,Testicular cancer is the most common solid tumor among men 20 to 34 years old. It accounts for one of every seven deaths in late adolescent and young adult men. A majority of men in the most vulnerable ages are unaware of their risk for testicular cancer.,"Testicular cancer is the most common solid tumor among men 20 to 34 years old, and it accounts for one of every seven deaths in late adolescent and young adult men. However, studies during the past 20 years continue to show that a majority of men in the most vulnerable ages are unaware of their risk for testicular cancer, deny having had testicular examinations as a part of their routine physical assessments, and lack knowledge of testicular self-examination techniques. This descriptive study used a mailed questionnaire and evaluated self-reported testicular cancer detection behaviors among primary care physicians (N = 116). Breast exams and colorectal screening were included for masking and comparative purposes. Forty-nine percent of the physicians reported routinely performing age-appropriate testicular exams on patients, in contrast to performing breast (83%) and colorectal exams (68%). Instructing male patients to perform testicular self-examination was reported as a routine procedure by 29%, and breast exams were taught routinely by 86% of the physicians. Providing an opportunity for patients to give a return demonstration of the technique was reported 16% of the time for breast self-examination and 4% of the time for testicular self-examination. Teaching patients to do appropriate self-examinations can enhance the provider-client partnership in the provision of healthcare. When providers do not teach the patient to perform self-examinations, a valuable opportunity is missed."
Risk factors for breast cancer: is ionizing radiation among them?,"Golubicic, Borojevic, Pavlovic","Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19145669/,"All human beings are exposed to the influence of ionizing radiation from natural, medical and other artificial sources.

The highest risk of radiation- induced breast cancer is evidenced in the sub-population of female patients who have undergone radiotherapy.","All human beings are exposed to the influence of ionizing radiation from natural, medical and other artificial sources. Therefore, the influence of radiation as a risk factor for cancer development has been among the most studied external factors over the last 6 decades, particularly with respect to radiosensitive tissues and organs. It has been known that female breast tissue is highly sensitive to the carcinogenic effects of radiation, particularly when exposure takes place at younger age. All women are exposed to low doses of radiation for several common reasons (kind of occupation, medical diagnostic procedures, residence background radiation) whose effects on breast cancer development cannot be documented, and thus it is believed that ionizing radiation is not primary or major risk factor leading to development of breast cancer. Radiobiological studies revealed a specific event caused by radiation through recognition of the critical target in radiation-induced carcinogenesis. Accordingly, mutagenic and carcinogenic effects of ionizing radiation are evidenced both in vitro and in vivo, although the incidence of radiation-induced cancers is low. The highest risk of radiation- induced breast cancer is evidenced in the sub-population of female patients who have undergone radiotherapy for either malignant or non-malignant diseases, including benign breast diseases in their childhood or young age. Therefore, as a means of prevention in this group of population, indications for application of ionizing radiation, both diagnostic and therapeutic, should be highly selective, meaning that radiation should be applied only if the possible benefit outweighs the risk."

A cross-sectional study of 1820 randomly selected AIs living in 7 US cities. Data were collected via telephone interviews by trained multilingual AI staff; the response rate was 62%. The primary outcome variables were age- and sex-specific cancer screening behaviors. Most of the AIs are men, married, educated, and with some form of health insurance. One fifth reported a family history of cancer. Adherence to mammography, Papanicolaou test, and clinical breast examination was higher in contrast to low rates of breast self-examination in women. Similarly, men reported low clinical testicular examination and fecal occult blood test, although prostate-specific antigen screening was higher than the reported rates among Asian Americans. Men were more likely to get a colonoscopy than women. The length of time in the United States had a relatively weak effect, and a family history of cancer had a moderate effect on screening behavior. Education and access to health care increased the odds (2-6 times) of cancer screening in AI men and women. Cancer screening varies by educational level, years lived in the United States, and access to health care, among AIs living in the United States. Differences in sociodemographic factors should be considered to predict adherence to cancer screening guidelines and also be factored into patient education in this ethnic subgroup."
Hormones and progeny of breast tumor cells.,"Schneider, BÃ¶cker","Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16698656/,The risk of breast cancer is inversely related to parity. Women during adolescence have the highest susceptibility to breast cancer development. This appears to be the period when the mammary gland has the highest number of stem cells. Stem cells may represent important targets for transformational events.,"The rudimentary human glandular breast, with the approach of puberty, starts to grow both at glandular and stromal sites. Full differentiation is a gradual process and takes many years, and is only fully attained by pregnancy. The risk of breast cancer is inversely related to parity. Women during adolescence have the highest susceptibility to breast cancer development. This appears to be the period when the mammary gland has the highest number of stem cells. Stem cells may represent important targets for transformational events. Immunohistochemistry allows for identification of the lineage-specific precursor glandular and myoepithelial cells and their differentiated progeny. Both estrogen receptor subtypes are found in epithelial cells of alveoli and ducts as well as in stromal cells. Immunophenotypia of benign proliferative breast disease favors a fundamentally different epithelial composition from that of most malignant epithelial proliferations such as atypical ductal hyperplasia, ductal carcinoma in situ, lobular neoplasia and invasive breast carcinoma. Immunophenotypical characterization of these lesions assists in distinguishing benign from malignant disease. Based on the observation of bilateral risks and frequent multifocality with atypical ductal hyperplasia, atypical lobular hyperplasia and lobular carcinoma in situ, it is suggested that these may represent risk factors as well as precursors. One should, however, realize that ductal as well as lobular premalignant breast lesions ultimately arise from stem cells in the terminal duct lobular units. Estrogen receptor-beta (ERbeta)-positive and ERalpha-negative expression characterizes the highest levels of proliferative cancer cell activity. Point mutations and alterations of co-activators and co-repressors will also determine hormone sensitivity. There is evidence for different genetic pathways in the development of ductal carcinoma in situ and lobular carcinoma in situ. While they share recurrent 16q losses, a second hit in the E-cadherin gene explains the advent of lobular lesions and their common existence with the primary ductal type. Based on our immunocytochemical observations, the most likely target cell of malignant transformation is the Ck18/18-positive and ER-negative transient cell of normal breast epithelium. Pregnancy confers a different genomic imprint to breast epithelial stem cells. Further elucidation of this mechanism may assist in developing appropriate means of breast cancer prevention.

[Sport and health].,"PÃ¨ne, Touitou","English Abstract, Journal Article",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19718895/,"National Academy of Medicine report underlines the medical, social and educational dimensions of sporting activities. Report underlines that sport medicine is practically not taught in the initial training of medical doctors. A major aim from the view point of public health is to reinforce the fight against doping.","The report of the National Academy of Medicine named ""Sport and Health"" underlines the medical, social and educational dimensions of sporting activities. Various kinds of sporting practices are described: they concern the approximately 7,000 high level athletes, around 8,000 professional (licensed) sportsmen, and sporting club members (approximately 15 millions people). A large number of amateurs do not practice in any structure and therefore are neither managed in their activities nor medically followed. Some characteristics of sporting practice at various stages of life have been documented. Around 50% of the teenagers from 12 to 17 years have a sporting practice out-of-school besides the weekly three hours applied at school or college; however, the withdrawal of sporting practice by a high number of teenagers results in a sedentary lifestyle with overweight and obesity, major risks factors for health. Elderly people take a profit from a regular and medically controlled physical activity. Functional capacities are thus improved, cardiovascular risks factors among other, which results in better quality of life of the aged and delays their dependence. The benefit upon public health of sporting practice has been pointed out in the primary prevention of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, osteoporosis, obesity, diabetes, breast and colon cancer, and mood disturbances. It is currently well acknowledged that sporting practice is an important component of public health in both primary and secondary prevention of many diseases. Deleterious effects of which the most serious is the sudden death related to a cardiovascular anomaly, which generally occurs during an important physical effort. An important sport drift is the practice of doping to improve performances through the use of hormones, anabolics, EPO, transfusions, ... When a person exceeds his/her capacities of adaptation, because of a badly adapted or a too intense drive, this overtraining results in a reduction in physical capabilities, stress, behavioral issues and sleep-wake disorders. All of those issues often lead sportsmen to doping with the aim to improve their capabilities, rapidly installing an overtiredness state resulting in a fall of performances. A major aim from the view point of public health is to reinforce the fight against doping since it concerns a large number of people, sportsmen and amateurs, with teenagers among them. Lastly, this report underlines that sport medicine is practically not taught in the initial training of medical doctors. The qualification of sport physician is obtained through a diploma named sport medicine capacity."

Re-thinking breast and cervical cancer preventive campaigns in developing countries: the case for interventions at high schools.,Ifediora,Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31053073/,"Negative impact of cervical and breast cancers in low and lower-middle income countries are worsening. Most preventive approaches to these cancers require government funding. Few countries with the most at-risk population can afford government-sponsored universal vaccination, screening, diagnostic and treatment programmes.","The negative impact of cervical and breast cancers in low and lower-middle income countries are worsening, and, along with other non-communicable diseases, occur disproportionately in these resource-limited economies. Most preventive approaches to these cancers require government funding, but few countries with the most at-risk population can afford government-sponsored universal vaccination, screening, diagnostic and treatment programmes, which, along with socioeconomic issues, contribute to the poor outcomes in these mostly developing countries. An urgent need exists, therefore, to find an effective, affordable, cost-effective, culturally-acceptable and sustainable way of reducing these cancers. This paper advocates a re-thinking in the current preventive campaigns. Using evidence provided by recently-published papers, a case is made for enlightenment campaigns to primarily target teenagers (boys and girls) in high schools of developing countries. Inclusions into the schools' academic curricula are the recommended approach, given that both cancers take hold on populations within that age bracket. This approach, if adopted, may be the only accessible, affordable and realistic approach that gives millions of women in low and lower-middle income countries the chance at survival. Empowering them early instils the self-awareness and confidence necessary for young adults to take charge of their own health. The acquired knowledge, in turn, helps them adopt positive attitudes and preventive behaviours that will, ultimately, prolong their lives. The recommended approach offers governments and concerned stakeholders an evidence-based option that allows them to deliver cost-effective and sustainable life-saving interventions, while hoping to get around the bottlenecks that limit the large scale implementation of other effective but capital-intensive strategies."

In this study, we evaluated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on breast cancer (BC) diagnosis. We extracted data from the medical records of patients age older than 18 years who were diagnosed with BC and started treatment or follow-up in private oncology institutions in Brazil between 2018 and 2021. The primary objective was to compare the stage distribution during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2021) with a historical prepandemic control cohort (2018-2019). Early BC was defined as stage I-II and advanced disease as stage IV. We collected data for 11,753 patients with an initial diagnosis of BC, with 6,493 patients in the pandemic (2020-2021) and 5,260 patients in the prepandemic period (2018-2019). We observed a lower prevalence of early-stage BC (63.6% <i>v</i> 68.4%) and a higher prevalence of advanced-stage BC (16.9 <i>v</i> 12.7%), after the onset of the pandemic (both <i>P</i> < .01). This pattern was similar for both estrogen receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive tumors: significantly decreased in the early stage from 69% to 67% and 68% to 58%, respectively, and a considerable increase in advanced-stage disease from 13% to 15% and 13% to 20%, respectively. For triple-negative BC, there was a significantly higher percentage of patients with advanced-stage disease during the pandemic (17% <i>v</i> 11%). Overall, age 50 years or older and postmenopausal status were associated with a greater risk of advanced stage at diagnosis during the pandemic period. We observed a substantial increase in the number of cases of advanced-stage BC in Brazil during the COVID-19 pandemic."
Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Agonists for Ovarian Function Preservation in Premenopausal Women Undergoing Chemotherapy for Early-Stage Breast Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"Munhoz, Pereira, Sasse, Hoff, Traina, Hudis, Marques","Journal Article, Meta-Analysis, Review, Systematic Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26426573/,Chemotherapy may result in a detrimental effect on ovarian function and fertility in premenopausal women undergoing treatment for early-stage breast cancer (EBC) Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) have been suggested as an alternative to prevent the loss of ovarian function due to exposure to cytotoxic agents. To determine the effectiveness of GnRHa administered concurrently with chemotherapy for ovarian function preservation.,"Chemotherapy may result in a detrimental effect on ovarian function and fertility in premenopausal women undergoing treatment for early-stage breast cancer (EBC). To minimize risk of harm to ovarian function and fertility for patients in this setting, careful considerations should be made. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) have been suggested as an alternative to prevent the loss of ovarian function due to exposure to cytotoxic agents, but GnRHa use for ovarian protection in EBC patients is not fully resolved. To determine the effectiveness of GnRHa administered concurrently with chemotherapy for ovarian function preservation. PubMed, SCOPUS, and Cochrane databases were searched for studies published between January 1975 and March 2015. The abstracts of the American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting between 1995 and 2014 and the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium between 2009 and 2014 were searched as well. Prospective, randomized, clinical trials addressing the role of ovarian suppression with GnRHa in preventing early ovarian dysfunction in premenopausal women undergoing treatment for EBC were selected. Data extraction was performed independently by 2 authors. The methodology and the risk of bias were assessment based on the description of randomization method, withdrawals, and blinding process. Rate of resumption of regular menses after a minimal follow-up period of 6 months following chemotherapy was used as a surrogate to assess the incidence of ovarian dysfunction. Additional secondary outcomes included hormone levels and number of pregnancies. Risk ratio estimates were calculated based on the number of evaluable patients. Analyses were conducted using a random effect model. Seven studies were included in this analysis, totaling 1047 randomized patients and 856 evaluable patients. The use of GnRHa was associated with a higher rate of recovery of regular menses after 6 months (odds ratio [OR], 2.41; 95% CI, 1.40-4.15; P = .002) and at least 12 months (OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.33-2.59; P < .001) following the last chemotherapy cycle. The use of GnRHa was also associated with a higher number of pregnancies (OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.02-3.36; P = .04), although this outcome was not uniformly reported and fertility or rate of pregnancy was not the primary outcome in any of the trials. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists given with chemotherapy was associated with increased rates of recovery of regular menses in this meta-analysis. Evidence was insufficient to assess outcomes related to GnRHa and ovarian function and fertility and needs further investigation."

Implementation of cardioprotective strategies as part of breast cancer treatment are needed. To date, a limited number of studies have examined the effectiveness of cardiac rehabilitation programs or exercise programs in the prevention of cardiotoxicity through an integral assessment of cardiac function. The ONCORE study proposes an exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation program as a non-pharmacological tool for the management of chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity. The study protocol describes a prospective, randomized controlled trial aimed to determine whether an intervention through an exercise-based CR program can effectively prevent cardiotoxicity induced by anthracyclines and/or anti-HER2 antibodies in women with breast cancer. Three hundred and forty women with breast cancer at early stages scheduled to receive cardiotoxic chemotherapy will be randomly assigned (1:1) to participation in an exercise-based CR program (intervention group) or to usual care and physical activity recommendation (control group). Primary outcomes include changes in left ventricular ejection fraction and global longitudinal strain as markers of cardiac dysfunction assessed by transthoracic echocardiography. Secondary outcomes comprise levels of cardiovascular biomarkers and cardiopulmonary function through peak oxygen uptake determination, physical performance and psychosocial status. Supervised exercise program-related outcomes including safety, adherence/compliance, expectations and physical exercise in- and out-of-hospital are studied as exploratory outcomes. Transthoracic echocardiography, clinical test and questionnaires will be performed at the beginning and two weeks after completion of chemotherapy. The growing incidence of breast cancer and the risk of cardiotoxicity derived from cancer treatments demand adjuvant cardioprotective strategies. The proposed study may determine if an exercise-based CR program is effective in minimizing chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity in this population of women with early-stage breast cancer. The proposed research question is concrete, with relevant clinical implications, transferable to clinical practice and achievable with low risk.

Two-yearly colorectal cancer screening using the faecal occult blood test is a new goal.,"Spanish cancer strategy is being developed in the context of a decentralised health care system. The advantages and challenges posed by this system are reviewed, particularly vis-Ã -vis the need to build consensus among regional health services as regards priorities in cancer control. Analysis of the impact of cancer in Spain enables smoking prevention and obesity reduction to be highlighted, especially among adolescents, as targets for primary prevention. Two-yearly colorectal cancer screening using the faecal occult blood test and targeting persons aged 50-69 years is a new goal that should be pursued countrywide, as should population-based breast cancer screening. Insofar as health care is concerned, the focus is on promoting and consolidating multidisciplinary cancer care based on evidence-based clinical guidelines, and on ensuring that cancer patients enjoy prompt access to diagnosis and therapy. Psychosocial support, with experience gained in several health services, should be expanded. Palliative care must be consolidated as a necessary therapy for patients who require it. Finally, the important boost to cancer research witnessed in recent years should be sustained. The approach adopted is based on building a co-operative strategy among all of Spain's autonomous regions (Comunidades AutÃ³nomas), which must then apply the interventions in their respective health services. A shared understanding of the main priorities for cancer control, through a review of the evidence and a consensus embracing all stakeholders, including scientific societies and patients' associations, is an essential step in the implementation of cancer strategy in Spain."
Asthma prevention: breast is best?,"Kemp, Kakakios","Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15228557/,There are many other beneficial effects of breastfeeding apart from the possibility of allergy prevention. The suggestion that breastfeeding may increase the development of allergic disease raises concerns about the appropriate steps to take for primary prevention of allergy.,"Whilst breastfeeding has been considered to exert a preventative effect on the development of allergic disease, several recent publications have challenged this view, particularly with respect to the long-term outcomes for asthma. There are many other beneficial effects of breastfeeding apart from the possibility of allergy prevention. The suggestion that breastfeeding may increase the development of allergic disease raises concerns about the appropriate steps to take for primary prevention of allergy. It is concluded that breastfeeding can still be recommended for the beneficial effects in reducing atopic disease in childhood in addition to the other demonstrated benefits, and that there are unresolved questions concerning the few studies that suggest the possibility of increased allergic disease in later life."

Preventive measures may include both exposure to allergens and adjuvant risk/protective factors and pharmacological treatment. These measures may address the general population, children at risk for development of atopic disease (high-risk infants), children with early symptoms of allergic disease or children with chronic disease. The objective for this review was to evaluate possible preventive measures as regards prevention of development of allergic disease in childhood--primary prevention--and also some aspects of the effect of specific allergy treatment as regards secondary prevention in children with allergic asthma and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. In one prospective observational study of a birth cohort of unselected infants we evaluated possible predictive/risk factors. In two prospective intervention studies including 1 yr birth cohorts of high-risk(HR) infants we investigated the effect of feeding HR infants exclusively breast milk (BM) and/or hydrolyzed cow's milk-based formula the first 4-6 months as regards: (i) the allergy preventive effect of BM/extensively hydrolysed formula (eHF) compared with ordinary cow's milk-based formula, (ii) the effect of two different eHFs, a whey (Profylac) and a casein-based (Nutramigen) formula, as regards development of cow's milk protein allergy (CMA), and (iii) a comparison of the preventive effect of eHF (Profylac/Nutramigen) with a partially hydrolyzed cow's milk-based formula (pHF) (NanHA) as regards development of CMA. None of the mothers had a restricted diet during pregnancy or lactation period. In two prospective randomized intervention studies we evaluated the preventive effect of specific allergen avoidance and specific immunotherapy (SIT) in children with allergic asthma and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, respectively. The combination of atopic heredity and elevated cord blood IgE resulted in the best predictive discrimination as regards development of allergic disease. The optimal high-risk group was defined by either double parental atopic predisposition or single atopic predisposition, the latter combined with a cord blood IgE > or = 0.3 kU/1. 66% of unselected infants were daily exposed to tobacco smoke, which was a significant risk factor for recurrent wheezing until the age of 1.5 yr. HR infants were breastfed for a longer period and less exposed to tobacco smoke than unselected infants. Exclusively BM/eHF for at least 4 months was associated with a significantly reduced cumulative prevalence of CMA [3.6% (5/141) vs. 20%(15/75) in the control group] up to 5 yr. The effect of the two different eHFs was similar. Exclusively breastfed infants were significantly less exposed to tobacco smoke and pets, had solid foods introduced later and belonged to higher social classes. pHF was significantly (p = 0.05) less effective than eHF as regards prevention of development of CMA. A diet period of 4 months seems to be as efficient as 6 months or more as regards development of CMA. A few ongoing prospective, randomized intervention studies have produced the first indication that avoidance of indoor allergens such as house dust mite (HDM) in HR infants may reduce the incidence of severe wheeze and sensitization during the first 1-4 yr of age."

Factors that make the policymakers and public health system worried are rising incidence of breast cancer in India and more importantly high death rates among breast cancer patients. One of the leading causes of high breast cancer deaths is lack of awareness and screening leading to the late presentation at an advanced stage. Therefore, the current research aimed to understand the knowledge of breast cancer symptoms and risk factors among women in a low socio-economic area of Mumbai. A cross-sectional study was conducted at Prabhadevi, Mumbai and primary data was collected from 480 women aged 18-55 years. Structured questionnaire was used to collect quantitative data pertaining to awareness, signs and symptoms of breast cancer. Bivariate and multivariate regression techniques were used for understanding of the socio-demographic differentials in breast cancer awareness among women. The study found that around half (49%) of the women were aware of breast cancer. The women who were aware of breast cancer considered lump in breast (75%), change in shape and size of breast (57%), lump under armpit (56%), pain in one breast (56%) as the important and common symptoms. Less than one-fifth of the women who were aware of breast cancer reported early menstruation (5.6%), late menopause (10%), hormone therapy (13%), late pregnancy (15%) and obesity (19%) as the risk factors for breast cancer. The multivariate regression analysis showed women who had more than 10 years of schooling (Adjusted Odds Ratio: 3.93, CI: 2.57-6.02, P < 0.01) were about 4 times more likely to be aware of breast cancer than women who had less than 10 years of schooling. In conclusion, knowledge of danger signs and risk factors of breast cancer were low among women in the community. This may lead to late detection of breast cancer among women in the community. Therefore, the study calls for advocacy and larger intervention to enhance knowledge of breast cancer among women in the particular region with a special reference to women with low education."

Consequently, Benjamin and Smitch suggested attaching the notion of basic prevention to the standard division into primary and secondary one. The basic prevention, carrying out in the general population, should concern genetic predisposition, psychosocial factors, keeping up proper body weight, healthy eating and physical activity. Especially high hopes are connected with high efficiency, simplicity and low money-consumption of preventive activities associated with physical activity modification, which has a crucial influence on reducing negative impact of atherosclerosis hazard. The results of numerous scientific research, carried out in many countries and on various, large groups, proved undoubtedly that at the healthy adult people of both sex the systematic physical activity of moderate intensification plays an essential part in preventing CVD and decreasing the death risk because of that reason as well. Moreover, systematic physical exercises show many other health-oriented actions, thanks to which they have an influence on decreasing premature and total death rate.

This analysis of the ADEBAR trial aims to evaluate application and effect of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and epoetin alfa (EPO) on hematologic parameters and fatigue in patients with breast cancer during chemotherapy. In the ADEBAR trial, 1493 patients with node-positive primary breast cancer were randomized to either 6 Ã— 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FEC120) or 4 Ã— epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by 4 Ã— docetaxel (EC-DOC). Co-medication with G-CSF or EPO was applied to treat chemotherapy-induced leukopenia or anemia. Fatigue was assessed at baseline and after one-half of the chemotherapy. In total, 899 patients could be included in the analysis. There was no evidence for an association between leucocyte or hemoglobin levels and application of G-CSF and EPO in the preceding cycle, respectively. Hemoglobin levels (B = -0.41; P < .001) were affected by treatment regimen. Fatigue during chemotherapy was mostly affected by the level of fatigue before the start of chemotherapy (B = 0.41; P < .001). Patients with G-CSF application in the preceding cycle showed an increased fatigue score (B = 5.43; P = .02). We showed that fatigue during adjuvant chemotherapy was mostly affected by the level of fatigue present before the start of chemotherapy.

This was a phase III study to compare FAC and TAC as adjuvant treatment of high-risk node-negative breast cancer patients. After the entry of the first 237 patients, the protocol was amended to include PPG in the TAC arm due to the high incidence of febrile neutropenia. A total of 1047 evaluable patients from 49 centres in Spain, two in Poland and four in Germany were included in the trial. Side-effects and the scores of the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ BR-23 questionnaires were compared in the three groups (FAC, TAC pre-amendment and TAC post-amendment). The addition of PPG to TAC significantly reduced the incidence of neutropenic fever, grade 2-4 anaemia, asthenia, anorexia, nail disorders, stomatitis, myalgia and dysgeusia. Patient QoL decreased during chemotherapy, more with TAC than FAC, but returned to baseline values afterwards. The addition of PPG to TAC significantly reduced the percentage of patients with clinically relevant Global Health Status deterioration (10 or more points over baseline value) at the end of chemotherapy (64% versus 46%, P<0.03). The addition of PPG significantly reduces the incidence of neutropenic fever associated with TAC chemotherapy as well as that of some TAC-induced haematological and extrahaematological side-effects. The HRQoL of patients treated with TAC is worse than that of those treated with FAC but improves with the addition of PPG, particularly in the final part of chemotherapy treatment."

In our study, we assessed the prevalence of NTSPCs in thyroid cancer population and evaluated the possible causative role of 131-I treatment. We analyzed 1096 consecutive patients followed at our institution from 1964 to 1998. A total of 101 NTSPCs were observed in 92/1096 patients (8.4%) among which 17/101 (16.8%) diagnosed before DTC and 84/101 (83.2%) diagnosed after. The most frequent tumor sites observed were breast and bladder/urinary tract in the post-DTC group and breast and hematological system in the pre-DTC group. Regarding 131-I treatment, we did not observe any significant differences regarding either the number of treatments or the cumulative activity. The only significant parameter associated with an increased incidence of NTSPC was follow-up (P = .02): a longer follow-up period was associated with a higher number of NTSPCs. The mean latency between 131-I and NTSPC was 10.52 Â± 7.69 years. Comparing with the general Italian population, independent of radioiodine treatment, the standard incidence ratio in our cohort was similar to that of the general population (SIR 1.07) and this result was confirmed by analyzing only the treated group. In conclusion, these results show that the risk of NTSPCs in the DTC patients' population is similar to that in the general population and 131-I treatment was not associated with an increased risk."

Determinants of breast cancer early detection for cues to expanded control and care: the lived experiences among women from Western Kenya.,"Kisiangani, Baliddawa, Marinda, Mabeya, Choge, Adino, Khayeka-Wandabwa",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29859095/,70-80% of cancer cases are diagnosed in late stages in Kenya. Most women perceived breast cancer as a fatal disease. Rural women preferred self-prescribed medications and the use of alternative medicine for long periods.,"Estimately, 70-80% of cancer cases are diagnosed in late stages in Kenya with breast cancer being a common cause of mortality among women where late diagnosis is the major ubiquitous concern. Numerous studies have focused on epidemiological and health policy dynamics essentially underestimating the determining factors that shape people's choices and cues to health care service uptake. The study sought to evaluate the knowledge, attitude and health seeking behavior towards breast cancer and its screening in a quest to explain why women present for prognosis and treatment when symptomatic pointers are in advanced stages, impeding primary prevention strategies. Eight focus groups (6-10 members per group) and four key informant interviews were conducted among adult participants from rural and urban settings. Sessions were audio-recorded and transcribed. A thematic analysis of the data was based on the concepts of the health belief model. Data analysis was conducted using NVIVO10. Most women perceived breast cancer as a fatal disease and conveyed fear of having early screening. Rural women preferred self-prescribed medications and the use of alternative medicine for long periods before presenting for professional care on suspicion that the lump is cancerous. Accessibility to equipped health facilities, lack of information to establish effective follow-up treatment and low-income status were underscored as their major health seeking behavior barriers whereas, urban women identified marital status as their main barrier. Key informant interviews revealed that health communication programs emphasized more on communicable diseases. This could in part explain why there is a high rate of misconception and suspicion about breast cancer among rural and urban women in the study setting. Creating breast cancer awareness alongside clear guidelines on accessing screening and treatment infrastructure is critical. It was evident, a diagnosis of breast cancer or lump brings unexpected confrontation with mortality; fear, pain, cultural barriers, emotional and financial distress. Without clear referral channels to enable those with suspicious lumps or early stage disease to get prompt diagnosis and treatment, then well-meaning awareness will not necessarily contribute to reducing morbidity and mortality."

Primary Preventive Care of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Survivors: Time to Educate and Empower Recipients and Providers.,"Fulcher, Blanchard, Bredeson, van Walraven","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36336256/,HCT recipients are at increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and subsequent neoplasm (SN) Strict surveillance of risk factors for CVD and cancer in the general population is recommended as an essential component of long-term follow-up (LTFU) care of HCT survivors.,"Increasing use of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) and improvements in recipient outcomes have led to a steady increase in the number of allogeneic HCT survivors. In addition to complications specific to the transplantation process, HCT recipients are at increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and subsequent neoplasm (SN). Strict surveillance of risk factors for CVD and cancer in the general population is recommended as an essential component of long-term follow-up (LTFU) care of HCT survivors, but implementation of this has been suboptimal. Various models for improving the provision of survivorship care have been proposed, including a hybrid/combined care approach wherein the HCT provider manages transplantation-specific complications and the primary care physician (PCP) provides general medical care, including surveillance and aggressive management of CVD risk factors and screening for SN. This model also offers a practical approach to LTFU care for HCT survivors who live at a distance from the HCT center, which is a reality for many recipients of HCT at The Ottawa Hospital (TOH). As the success of such a hybrid approach to survivorship care depends on the engagement of HCT recipients with their PCP and compliance with recommended general population surveillance, the aim of the present study was to assess the rates of PCP attendance and adherence to recommended preventive medicine interventions in the years immediately before and after HCT. We hypothesized that rates would be suboptimal and planned to use these results as a baseline for an educational initiative aimed at increasing awareness of HCT recipients and their PCPs about embracing preventive survivorship care. This was a single-center cohort study of allogeneic HCT recipients who underwent transplantation at TOH with linkage to population-based health administrative data. Published clinical practice guidelines were used to define recommended screening for CVD risk factors and cancer. The rates of annual PCP visits and utilization of recommended preventive care interventions in the 5 years before and after HCT were calculated for all eligible patients. Between 2014 and 2020, 409 patients with provincial health care coverage underwent allogeneic HCT at TOH. The median patient age was 51 years (range, 15 to 73 years), with a male predominance (60.9%). Approximately one-quarter of recipients did not attend a PCP visit in the 5 years before and after transplantation, and this proportion increased to one- third in the fifth year post-HCT. Among those recipients who were eligible, only 20% to 25% underwent recommended screening for dyslipidemia and diabetes. Cancer screening rates were also low, at 16% to 18% for cervical cancer, 18% to 22% for colon cancer, and 30% to 31% for breast cancer. These results highlight the need to increase awareness of HCT recipients and their PCPs about the risk of developing CVD and SN post-transplantation and to emphasize the potential to mitigate this risk by adhering to recommendations for surveillance to enable prompt intervention. Patient education should incorporate this information and empower HCT survivors to actively engage in their follow-up care and optimize their long-term outcomes."

The aim of this work was to compare four measurement methods for determining body composition regarding their validity, reliability and practicability in order to be able to draft a practical recommendation as to which method is most suitable as a standard measurement method in oncology. Fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM) was estimated for 100 breast cancer patients with ages of 18-70 years during a defined 20-week inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation process after primary therapy or follow-up rehabilitation. The four methods used were dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), leg-to-leg BIA and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). At baseline (t0) and after 20 weeks (t20) the agreement between the four body composition analysis methods was quantified by pairwise method comparisons using Bland-Altman bias and limits of agreement estimates, t-tests and Lin's concordance correlation coefficients (CCCs). CCCs and Bland-Altman plots indicated that DXA and BIA, DXA and NIRS as well as BIA and NIRS showed an excellent agreement concerning FM estimation at both time points (CCC>0.9). In contrast, no methods agreed with a CCC higher than 0.9 with respect to FFM estimation. However, most estimates were also significantly different between two methods, except for BIA and NIRS which yielded comparable FFM and FM estimates at both time points, albeit with large 95% limits of agreement intervals. The agreement between DXA and BIA was best in the lowest BMI tertile and worsened as BMI increased. Significant differences were also found for FFM changes measured with DXA versus BIA (mean difference -0.4 kg, p = 0.0049), DXA versus to Leg-to-leg BIA (-0.6 kg, p = 0.00073) and for FM changes measured with DXA versus Leg-to-leg BIA (0.5 kg, p = 0.0011). For accurate and valid body composition estimates, Leg-to-leg BIA cannot be recommended due to its significant underestimation of FM or significant overestimation of FFM, respectively. BIA and NIRS results showed good agreement with the gold standard DXA. Therefore both measurement methods appear to be very well suitable to assess body composition of oncological patients and should be used more frequently on a routine basis to monitor the body composition of breast cancer patients."

Little is known about the feasibility of implementing these recommendations or how low-income women of color might respond to individualized risk assessment (IRA) performed by primary care providers (PCPs). Women recruited from a federally qualified health center were given the option to discuss BC risk status with their PCP. Comprehensive IRA was performed using a software tool designed for the primary care environment combining three assessment instruments and providing risk-adapted recommendations for screening, prevention, and genetic referral. Logistic regression models assessed factors associated with wanting to learn and discuss BC risk with PCP. Of 237 participants, only 12.7% (n = 30) did not want to discuss IRA results with their PCP. Factors associated with lower odds of wanting to learn results included having private insurance and reporting ever having had a mammogram. Factors associated with higher odds of wanting to learn results included older age (50 to 69 years) and increased BC worry. For all women wishing to learn results, IRA was successfully completed and delivered to the PCP immediately before the encounter for incorporation into the well-visit evaluation. Incorporation of US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations as part of routine primary care is feasible. Interest in IRA seems high among underserved women. This approach warrants further investigation as a strategy for addressing disparities in BC mortality."

We determined the overall incidence of second primary lung cancer after previous RT for all clinical stages of BC. After an analysis of the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database, 986,713 individuals were randomly enrolled from 2000 to 2010 for cohort analysis. All women with newly diagnosed invasive BC, aged 18 years or older, and without other types of malignancy before 2000 or in the follow-up periods were enrolled and allocated to the RT or non-RT groups. Age, comorbidities, insurance premium, urbanization level, location, date of event, and hospital care level were analyzed. The hazard ratios of parameters were calculated by Cox regression analysis. A total of 7408 individuals met the inclusion criteria, including 5695 patients with BC who underwent RT and 128 (2.25%) in whom lung cancer developed. In contrast, lung cancer was diagnosed in only four of 1713 individuals in the non-RT group (0.23%) during the follow-up period. Cox regression analysis showed that the adjusted hazard ratio was 10.078 times higher in the RT group than in the non-RT group for individuals with previous BC. The incidence of second primary lung cancer was significantly higher in the RT group than in the non-RT group for individuals with previous BC. Patients with BC treated by RT should be extensively surveyed to assess the incidence of subsequent lung cancer."

Vitamin D and calcium play important anticarcinogenic roles in animal studies. Exposures between menarche and first birth may be important in breast development and future breast cancer risk. However, the relations between adolescent vitamin D and calcium intake and the risk of proliferative benign breast disease (BBD), a marker of increased breast cancer risk, have not yet been evaluated. We examined these associations in the Nurses' Health Study II. Among the 29,480 women who completed an adolescent diet questionnaire in 1998, 682 proliferative BBD cases were identified and confirmed by centralized pathology review between 1991 and 2001. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by Cox proportional hazards regression and adjusted for potential confounders. A suggestive inverse association was observed between adolescent total vitamin D intake and proliferative BBD. Women in the highest quintile of vitamin D intake during adolescence had a 21 % lower risk (multivariate HR (95 % CI): 0.79 (0.61, 1.01), p-trend = 0.07) of proliferative BBD than women in the lowest quintile. Results were essentially the same when the analysis was restricted to prospective cases (n = 142) diagnosed after return of the adolescent diet questionnaire and independent of adult vitamin D intake. Adolescent total milk intake was positively associated with proliferative BBD (â‰¥3 servings/day vs. <1 serving/day HR (95 % CI): 1.41 (0.91, 2.17), p-trend = 0.03), after additional adjustment for total vitamin D. Calcium intake during adolescence was not associated with proliferative BBD (p-trend = 0.91). Vitamin D intake during adolescence may be important in the earlier stage of breast carcinogenesis. These findings, if corroborated, may suggest new pathways and strategies for breast cancer prevention."

In recent years, there is a growing number of cancer deaths in Slovakia. Therefore, the structure of cancer deaths according to its primary determinants, such as age, sex and education with the aim of effective implementation of prevention programs in Slovakia was examined. Main source of data on deaths from 1996 to 2014 was provided by National Health Information Centre in Slovakia. However, data were available only from 2011. Standardized mortality rate per 100,000 inhabitants was estimated by the method of direct standardization using European standard population. The R project for statistical computing was used for calculation of statistically significant differences among various groups of mortality. The results show that people with primary education die from cancer later than people with higher education. However, major differences related to both sex and age are present in people with university education. A different variety of cancers occur in childhood (neoplasm of brain), adolescents (neoplasm of bone), young adults (neoplasm of brain), or adults (lung cancer and breast cancer). Malignant neoplasm of brain was more prevalent at higher education levels, Malignant neoplasm of bladder and Malignant melanoma of skin were more prevalent at the university level of education. The results can be useful for economists to define the health priorities in each country, make the financial decisions in economics, and thus contribute to better health, economic growth, as well as effective spending of health expenditures."

The main goal of this paper is to identify the determinants of individual decisions on breast screening and smear testing, that is to say, the decision to take a test for the first time and the decision to test with suitable regularity. To that end, we have combined analyses of micro and macro data (the Spanish National Health Survey and Spanish Regional Social Indicators) and employed multilevel estimation models. Among the main results, we highlight the fact that regional public screening programmes improve individual decisions on screening (more women testing for the first time and more women testing regularly) and, furthermore, they generate positive synergies; for example, regional public programmes for smear testing improve individual decisions on both cervical and breast cancer screening. In addition, we conclude that it is not only important to know if the numbers of women undergoing breast screening and smear testing are increasing, it is also important to know if they are testing regularly."
Creating awareness and facilitating cervical and breast cancer screening uptake through the use of a Community Health Worker: a pilot intervention study.,"Tum, Maree, Clarke","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22966910/,"In South Africa, cervical cancer is the most common female cancer followed by breast cancer.

Despite the high incidence of these cancers, population-based screening is limited to cervical screening available at primary health clinics. Cervical screening uptake is, however, low. In 2009 a new cancer prevention initiative was launched in a specific resource poor community in Tshwane, South Africa. The low cervical screening uptake as well as a potentially low breast screening uptake could have resulted in the failure of this initiative. The purpose of the study was to develop and pilot test an intervention to address this risk. A Community Health Worker was trained and tasked to raise awareness of cervical and breast cancer and motivate women to take up screening. The intervention was assessed in terms of three outcomes: screening uptake, awareness and the value of the Community Health Worker. Despite the fact that the Community Health Worker's role was valued, screening uptake was disappointing and the level of awareness remained low. Unfortunately this intervention failed and once again we are left with the challenge of improving screening uptake."
Preventive Health Application to Increase Breastfeeding.,"Francis, Dickton",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31373861/,Primary prevention utilizing consistent visits with lactation professionals with a group of new mothers may efficiently address this care gap. Maternal/infant dyads seen at day 3 had 2.5 times higher odds of EDB at 6 weeks than those not receiving IBCLC standard-of-care feeding assessment. Bottle use correlated with decreased odds of AB.,"<b><i>Background:</i></b> Mother-infant dyads are not meeting recommended breastfeeding goals. There is lack of consensus regarding any program's ability to increase breastfeeding duration to meet the recommended guidelines, and effective strategies are needed moving forward to help families meet those goals. Primary prevention utilizing consistent visits with lactation professionals with a group of new mothers may efficiently address this care gap. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Mother-infant dyads attending a newborn care clinic for 6 weeks received feeding assessment and standard-of-care guidance from an Internationally Board-Certified Lactation Consultant (IBCLC). Regression analysis was completed with outcome variables ""exclusive direct breastfeeding"" (EDB) and ""any breastfeeding"" (AB) at 6 weeks postpartum (PP) and odds ratios were calculated. <b><i>Results:</i></b> The number and timing of IBCLC visits was correlated with EDB at 6 weeks PP. Maternal/infant dyads seen at day 3 had 2.5 times higher odds of EDB at 6 weeks than those not receiving IBCLC standard-of-care feeding assessment. Dyads seen at days 3 and 14 had 3.4 times higher odds of EDB than those with less follow-up. Bottle use correlated with decreased odds of AB at 6 weeks PP; similarly, dyads seen only at day 14 PP had decreased odds of EDB. When looking at timing of the first involvement, dyads seen at 3 days had higher odds of EDB than dyads first seen at day 14 PP. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> This primary prevention strategy of early minimal intervention using an IBCLC increased the odds of EDB and AB at 6 weeks PP. These data support the conclusion that early feeding assessment the first 2 weeks PP with an IBCLC may increase breastfeeding at 6 weeks PP."

Mindfulness-based cancer recovery (MBCR) is an evidence-based intervention for treating such symptoms, but has not been investigated as an adjunctive treatment during CT. This study aims to determine the efficacy of an online group MBCR programme delivered during CT in 12 real-time interactive weekly sessions for managing fatigue (primary outcome). Secondary outcomes include sleep disturbance, pain, nausea/vomiting, mood, stress and QoL. Exploratory outcomes include cognitive function, white blood cell counts and return to work. The study is a two-armed randomised controlled waitlist trial with 2:1 allocation to treatment (online group MBCR during CT) or control (waitlist usual care; online MBCR following CT completion) with a target sample size of N = 178. Participants are breast or colorectal cancer patients undergoing common CT regimens in Calgary, Canada. Online assessments using validated self-reported instruments will take place at baseline, post-MBCR, post-CT and 12 months' post-baseline. If online MBCR delivered during CT significantly reduces fatigue in cancer patients' post-CT and also impacts secondary symptoms, this would provide evidence for including mindfulness training as an adjunctive symptom management therapy during CT."
Unhealthy food advertising.

Children and adolescents are a particularly vulnerable population to food advertising strategies. In Spain unhealthy product advertising are still very common in the media and in the children's online environment.,"Some important factors influencing and maintaining unhealthy habits are food advertising and products accessibility. In order to develop and support recommendations, an analysis of the available evidence on the impact of food advertising on the health of children and adolescents has been carried out. Literature review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses published up to January 2022 for the term ""food advertising"" that analyzed the impact of food advertising on weight, body mass index (BMI), adiposity, dietary intake, behavior toward the advertised product, its purchase or consumption in children and adolescents. Twenty-one systematic reviews fulfilled the inclusion criteria, including a total of 490 primary studies, 5 of which also contained a meta-analysis. The vast majority of the primary studies evaluate intermediate effects, related to the behavior of children and adolescents in relation to advertised products and their consumption. There is great variety in terms of the type of advertising and effects studied. Most of the studies agree that there is an association between food advertising and effect analyzed, being more evident in children under 12 years of age and in obese children. Most recent systematic reviews are focused on online advertising, noticing the negative effects especially in adolescents. Children and adolescents are a particularly vulnerable population to food advertising strategies. Despite the difficulty to demonstrate an independent effect, there is evidence of an association between food advertising and childhood and adolescents' behavior respect to the announced products, and the increase of consumption at short-term. In Spain unhealthy product advertising are still very common in the media and in the children and adolescent's online environment. The Nutrition and Breastfeeding Committee of the Spanish Association of Pediatrics supports the need for regulation and limitation of unhealthy food advertising, covering all media and marketing strategies."
Are changes in breast self-exam recommendations and early misperceptions of breast cancer risk increasing women's future risks?,"Polek, Hardie",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26596968/,Study characterized misperceived knowledge of breast cancer risk in younger women.

National Cancer Institute survey found that NPs and other providers are the most trusted sources of health information.,"Young women, high school age, are exposed to breast cancer messages targeting adult women that can result in misperceptions, increasing future risks. Changes in breast self-exam screening recommendations may reduce nurse practitioner (NP) time addressing breast health. This study characterized misperceived knowledge of breast cancer risk in younger women. A survey (338 high school students aged 14 to 19) was conducted to assess their perceptions of breast cancer etiologies and risk behaviors. Survey results indicated 20% to 50% of students had misperceptions about breast cancer risk, and the mean knowledge score for all items was 65.47%. There were no differences in students with familial breast cancer histories or those instructed in breast self-exam. Approximately 12% reported being fearful, avoiding public health messages, and approximately 20% thought breastfeeding increased breast cancer risk. The findings suggest that school-based programs are not addressing misperceptions related to breast health effectively. A National Cancer Institute survey found that NPs and other providers are the most trusted sources of health information. Given the low rates of breast cancer in young women and recommendations against teaching breast self-exam, it is important for NPs to be knowledgeable about common misperceptions and address them with their patients."
Effect of magnesium sulfate with ketamine infusions on intraoperative and postoperative analgesia in cancer breast surgeries: a randomized double-blind trial.,"Hassan, Mahran","Randomized Controlled Trial, Journal Article",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34332956/,Ketamine and Magnesium (Mg) are NMDA receptor antagonists used as adjuvant analgesics to decrease postoperative opioid consumption.

Multivitamin-multimineral supplements: who uses them?,Rock,"Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17209209/,"Multivitamin formulations with or without minerals are typically the most common type of dietary supplement reported. In the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2000, 52% of adults reported taking a dietary supplement.","Dietary supplement use is increasingly common in the United States. Multivitamin formulations with or without minerals are typically the most common type of dietary supplement reported in surveys and studies that collect data relating to dietary supplement use. In the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2000, 52% of adults reported taking a dietary supplement in the past month, and 35% reported regular use of a multivitamin-multimineral (MVMM) product. NHANES III data indicate an overall prevalence of dietary supplement usage of 40%, with prevalence rates of 35% in NHANES II and 23% in NHANES I. Women (versus men), older age groups, non-Hispanic whites (versus non-Hispanic blacks or Mexican Americans), and those with a higher education level, lower body mass index, higher physical activity level, and more frequent consumption of wine had a greater likelihood of reporting use of MVMM supplements in NHANES 1999-2000. Data from children suggest a similar prevalence rate, but lower prevalence rates of usage were reported in studies of adolescents. Individuals who use dietary supplements (including MVMM formulations) generally report higher dietary nutrient intakes and healthier diets in studies in which dietary data were also collected. Among adults with a history of breast or prostate cancer, usage rates for dietary supplements in general and MVMMs are considerably higher (eg, 56-57% for MVMMs), and these subgroups are more likely to also report use of single vitamin and mineral supplements. Thus, MVMM use contributes a considerable proportion of nutrient intakes in the United States and may contribute to risk of excessive intakes."

The period of childhood and growth into adolescence and early adulthood may re-present a 'cumulative risk' for later adult-onset cancers. We review a number of epidemiologic studies that have examined associations among childhood and adolescent body size, diet, and physical activity with adult cancer risk. These studies suggest that unhealthy behaviors that develop early in life and persist over time may increase the risk of some cancer types, such as premenopausal breast, ovarian, endometrial, colon and renal cancer, adversely affect cancer-related morbidities, and increase mortality. Continued research is needed to further determine and refine how timing and degree of such exposures in early childhood and adolescence relate to adult cancer risk. Presently, sufficient evidence suggests a continued need for stronger primary prevention in cancer and obesity research via modified lifestyle behaviors earlier in the developmental spectrum, i.e. during childhood and adolescence."

Case-comparison study using written survey. Data were analyzed using measures of central tendency, chi 2 analysis, logistic regression, and risk using odds ratios. General community. A total of 843 women, 450 with disabilities and 393 of their able-bodied friends, aged 18 to 65, who completed the written questionnaire. The most common primary disability type was spinal cord injury (26%), followed by polio (18%), neuromuscular disorders (12%), cerebral palsy (10%), multiple sclerosis (10%), and joint and connective tissue disorders (8%). Twenty-two percent had severe functional limitations, 52% had moderate disabilities, and 26% had mild disabilities. Outcomes were measured in terms of frequency of pelvic exams and mammograms. Women with disabilities tend to be less likely than women without disabilities to receive pelvic exams on a regular basis, and women with more severe functional limitations are significantly less likely to do so. No significant difference was found between women with and without disabilities, regardless of severity of functional limitation, in receiving mammograms within the past 2 years. Perceived control emerged as a significant enhancement factor for mammograms and marginally for pelvic exams. Severity of disability was a significant risk factor for noncompliance with recommended pelvic exams, but not mammograms. Race was a significant risk factor for not receiving pelvic exams, but not mammograms. Household income and age did not reach significance as risk factors in either analysis. Women with physical disabilities are at a higher risk for delayed diagnosis of breast and cervical cancer, primarily for reasons of environmental, attitudinal, and information barriers. Future research should focus on the subpopulations that were not surveyed adequately in this study, women with disabilities who have low levels of education or income, or who are of minority status."
Social inequalities in cancer with special reference to South Asian countries.,"Kurkure, Yeole","Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16629512/,"There are major differences in cancer burden across socioeconomic classes, as is evident from the data for cancer incidence and mortality from Greater Mumbai, India.

Changes over time are also evident and recently there has been a clear shift to increasing breast cancer particularly in well-educated women, who conversely are at much lower risk of cervical cancer. With infection-related and tobacco-related cancers, programs of prevention and early detection will yield desirable results only if it is associated with a program directed towards elimination of poverty, illiteracy and restoring social inequality. Similarly education must play a role in combatting diet-related neoplasia but here the target population may differ, requiring a specific awareness of psychological profiles."

This study examined the association between future time preference and use of genetic counseling for BRCA1/2 testing and how this association may differ from the relationship between future time preference and mammography screening and self-breast examination. A health system-based case-control study with a nested cross-sectional survey. Eight hundred women who saw a primary care physician in the University of Pennsylvania Health System in the 3 years before the study, of whom 234 had undergone BRCA1/2 counseling (cases) and of whom 566 had not (controls). Placing a relatively greater value on future benefits than present benefits was strongly associated with use of BRCA1/2 counseling [odds ratio (OR), 3.0 for one-point increase in future time preference; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 1.9-4.9]. Future time preference was weakly associated with adherence to annual mammography (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.81-2.2), and was not associated with monthly self-breast examination (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.75-1.4). A stronger future orientation was seen in women who had higher levels of education (P = 0.0021) or income (P = 0.0011). Time preference is strongly associated with use of BRCA1/2 counseling. Time preference is more weakly associated with mammography adherence and is not associated with breast self-examination. This variation may reflect the degree to which the behavior is seen as related to future risk."

This study estimates disparities in breast cancer among younger compared with older women by race/ethnicity using five measures of population health: life expectancy (LE), expected years of life lost (EYLL), cumulative incidence rate (CIR), and incidence and mortality rate ratios (IRR and MRR). Using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data, LE and EYLL were estimated from a cohort of 15-44 and 45-64 years, non-Hispanic black (NHB), non-Hispanic white (NHW), and Hispanic women diagnosed with breast cancer, 2000-2013. Survival function was obtained from the study years and then extrapolated to lifetime using the Monte Carlo method. The CIR, IRR and MRR were calculated using 2009-2013 breast cancer incidence and mortality rates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Program of Cancer Registries. The estimated LE ranged from 32.12 to 7.42 years for localized to distant stages among younger NHB women compared to 33.05 to 9.95 years for younger NHW women. The estimated EYLL was 12.78 years for younger women, and 4.99 for older women. By race/ethnicity, it was 15.53 years for NHB, 14.23 years for Hispanic and 11.87 years for NHW (P<0.00025). The CIR for age-group 15-44 years (CIR<sub>15-44</sub>) indicated a 1 in 86 probability for NHB compared to a 1 in 87 probability for NHW being diagnosed with breast cancer by age 45. The estimated age-adjusted incidence rate for NHB-to-NHW women was IRR=1.10 (95%, CI=1.08-1.11) and the corresponding mortality rate was MRR=2.02 (95%, CI=1.94-2.11). The breast cancer disparities between younger NHB compared to NHW women highlight the need for expanded efforts to address these disparities through primary prevention and to improve access to quality healthcare to minority women with breast cancer."

The study panel was divided into 2 groups: a treatment group of individuals who were selected in the Medicaid lottery (6254 individuals) and a control group who were not (9950 individuals). The authors also created an elevated risk subpanel based on family cancer histories. One year after the lottery drawings, differences in cancer screening rates, preventive behaviors, and health status were compared between the study groups. Medicaid coverage resulted in significantly higher rates of several common cancer screenings, especially among women, as well as better primary care connections and self-reported health outcomes. There was little evidence found that acquiring Medicaid increased the adoption of preventive health behaviors that might reduce cancer risk. Medicaid coverage did not appear to directly impact lifestyle choices that might reduce cancer risk, but it did provide access to important care and screenings that could help to detect cancers earlier. These findings could have long-term population health implications for states considering or pursuing Medicaid expansion. Cancer 2016;122:791-797. Â© 2015 American Cancer Society."

Biopsychosocial risk factors and knowledge of cervical cancer among young women: A case study from Kenya to inform HPV prevention in Sub-Saharan Africa.,"Ngune, Kalembo, Loessl, Kivuti-Bitok",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32817627/,Nine women in their twenties die from cervical cancer in Kenya every day. Cervical cancer is the second most common female reproductive cancer after breast cancer with 84% of the cases in developing countries. A high uptake of human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination and screening leads to a reduction of incidence and mortality rates. Yet uptake of screening is low in Sub-Saharan Africa.,"Cervical cancer is the second most common female reproductive cancer after breast cancer with 84% of the cases in developing countries. A high uptake of human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination and screening, and early diagnosis leads to a reduction of incidence and mortality rates. Yet uptake of screening is low in Sub-Saharan Africa and there is an increasing number of women presenting for treatment with advanced disease. Nine women in their twenties die from cervical cancer in Kenya every day. This paper presents the biopsychosocial risk factors that impact on cervical cancer knowledge among Kenyan women aged 15 to 24 years. The findings will highlight opportunities for early interventions to prevent the worrying prediction of an exponential increase by 50% of cervical cancer incidences in the younger age group by 2034. Data from the 2014 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS) was analysed using complex sample logistic regression to assess biopsychosocial risk factors of knowledge of cervical cancer among young women aged 15 to 24 years (n = 5398). Close to one third of the participants were unaware of cervical cancer with no difference between participants aged 15-19 years (n = 2716) and those aged 20-24 years (n = 2691) (OR = 1; CI = 0.69-1.45). Social predisposing factors, such as lack of education; poverty; living further from a health facility; or never having taken a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test, were significantly associated with lack of awareness of cervical cancer (p<0.001). Young women who did not know where to obtain condoms had an OR of 2.12 (CI 1.72-2.61) for being unaware of cervical cancer. Psychological risk factors, such as low self-efficacy about seeking medical help, and an inability to refuse unsafe sex with husband or partner, perpetuated the low level of awareness about cervical cancer (p<0.001). A considerable proportion of young women in Kenya are unaware of cervical cancer which is associated with a variety of social and psychological factors. We argue that the high prevalence of cervical cancer and poor screening rates will continue to prevail among older women if issues that affect young women's awareness of cervical cancer are not addressed. Given that the Kenyan youth are exposed to HPV due to early sexual encounters and a high prevalence of HIV, targeted interventions are urgently needed to increase the uptake of HPV vaccination and screening."
Recent advances on diagnosis and management of childhood asthma and food allergies.,"Hakimeh, Tripodi","Comparative Study, Editorial, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24373684/,"The epidemic of childhood allergic disorders has been associated to the decline of infectious disease.

However, exposure to many triggers (airborne viruses, tobacco smoke, pollution, indoor allergens, etc.) contribute to the disease. Breast feeding practices, nutrition, dietary and obesity also play a multifaceted role in shaping the observed worldwide trends of childhood allergies. Guidelines for treatment are available, but their implementation is suboptimal. Then developed countries are slowing learning integrating the development of suitable guidelines with implementation plans. Awareness, psychosocial and family factors strongly influence asthma and food allergy control. Moreover, monitoring tools are necessary to facilitate self-management. By taking into consideration these and many other pragmatic aspects, national public health programs to control the allergic epidemic have been successful in reducing its impact and trace the need for future research in the area."

The present study aimed to identify Palestinian women's practices, awareness, and barriers to BSE. Using descriptive-analytical methods, a previously validated questionnaire was administered to a conveniently selected sample of women. The study was conducted among women who visited primary health clinics (PHCs) in Gaza City. A total of 390 participants who met the selection criteria answered the self-administered questionnaires. We used SPSS version 24.0 to analyze the data. The findings suggest that the practice of BSE among women in Gaza is low, with only 40% of the study participants reporting that they never practiced BSE before, even though 76.7% reported that they were aware of BSE. In general, the main barriers to BSE practices were that participants had wrong perceptions and lacked knowledge about BSE. Others also reported fear of detecting breast cancer as a barrier. The practice of BSE among Palestinian women in the Gaza Strip is low and marred with trivial issues as barriers that could be eliminated with dedicated and extensive educational campaigns in the area."

Due to the absence of effective screening methods, ovarian cancer is usually diagnosed at late stages. Patients with pathogenic and likely-pathogenic germline variants (PGVs) in BRCA1 or BRCA2 harbor elevated risk of developing both ovarian and breast cancers. Identifying PGVs may help in both cancer prevention and active disease treatment. Worldwide prevalence of PGVs varies and the matter is poorly addressed among Arab patients. Patients with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancers were offered the universal 20 or 84-multi-gene panel testing as per standard guidelines. Cascade family screening was also offered to all first and second-degree relatives of PGV positive patients. Genetic testing was done at a referral lab using a next generation sequencing (NGS)-based platform. During the study period, 152 patients, median age (range): 50 (18-79) years old, were tested. The majority (n = 100, 65.8%) had high-grade serous carcinoma, and 106 patients (69.7%) had metastatic disease at presentation. In total, 38 (25.0%) had PGVs, while 47 (30.9%) others had variants of uncertain significance (VUS). PGVs were mostly in BRCA1 (n = 21, 13.8%) and in BRCA2 (n = 12, 7.9%), while 6 (3.9%) others had PGVs in non-BRCA1/2 genes. PGV rates were significantly higher among 15 patients with a positive family history of ovarian cancer (60.0%, p = .022) and among 52 patients with a positive family history of breast cancer (40.4%, p = .017). PGVs are common among Jordanian women with ovarian cancer, and mostly occur in BRCA1/2.

Characteristics of Cancers in Adolescents and Young Adults Compared with Those in Adults in Their 60s: A Single-Center Experience.,"Aida, Fukushima, Bando, Ishikawa, Shikama, Sekine","Comparative Study, Journal Article",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35100598/,Cancer is one of the main causes of death among adolescents and young adults (AYAs) aged 15-39 years. The improvement in overall 5-year survival in AYA cancer patients was far below that of adult cancer patients.,"Cancer is one of the main causes of death among adolescents and young adults (AYAs) aged 15-39 years. The improvement in overall 5-year survival in AYA cancer patients was far below than that of adult cancer patients. The purpose of this study was to clarify the features of cancer in AYAs by comparing them with those of controls. Patients in the cancer registry of the University of Tsukuba Hospital between 2007 and 2017 (median age, 65 years) were included in this study. We used patients between the ages of 64 and 66 years as controls. We then obtained the age at diagnosis, sex, primary site, and pathological type. Among 27,281 cancer patients in the registry between 2007 and 2017, 1,947 (7.1%) patients were categorized into the AYA group, and 2,354 into the control group. Among men in the AYA group, central nervous system (CNS) tumors accounted for 22.7% of all cancers, followed by germ cell tumors, 22.5%, and hematopoietic malignancies, 12.5%. Among women in the AYA group, cervical cancer accounted for 35.9% of all cancers, followed by breast cancer, 14.6%, and CNS tumors, 11.6%. The proportion of specific cancer types relative to all cancers in the CNS, thyroid, adrenal glands, germ cells, cervix uteri, hematopoietic tissues, and sarcomas was higher in the AYA group than that in the control group. The present results for AYAs were in sharp contrast to those for adult cancers and may be related to different modes of pathogenesis in AYAs. The identification of high-risk groups of these tumors in the AYA generation is crucial for prevention and early detection and will be a major topic for future research. While most of adult cancers are treated independently by each medical department, AYA cancers need to be treated in collaboration with experts from several departments. It is desirable to address the issues involved in applying treatments established for adult cancers to AYA cancers on a cancer-by-cancer basis."

This study investigated whether breastfeeding practices are correlated with childhood maltreatment. Data were utilized from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, a nationally representative and longitudinal study of adolescents. The analytic sample comprised 4,159 adolescents. The outcome variables included four subtypes of childhood maltreatment (neglect, inadequate supervision, physical abuse, and sexual abuse). The primary independent variable was breastfeeding duration. Covariates of the child, mother, and household were included in analyses. Logistic regression models were employed to predict odds of maltreatment subtypes from breastfeeding duration and covariates. Compared with adolescents never breastfed, adolescents breastfed 9 months or longer had a reduced odds of having experienced neglect (odds ratio [OR] = 0.54; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.35-0.83) and sexual abuse (OR = 0.47; 95% CI = 0.24-0.93) after controlling for covariates. Breastfeeding duration is significantly associated with decreased childhood neglect and sexual abuse. Breastfeeding practices should be explored as a consideration among clinicians when assessing maltreatment risk. Further research should examine whether a causal relationship exists between breastfeeding and decreased maltreatment."

Antiestrogen use in breast cancer patients reduces the risk of subsequent lung cancer: A population-based study.,"Chu, Hsieh, Wang, Hong, Chu",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28319725/,There is accumulating evidence that estrogen might be a driver of lung cancer. Breast cancer survivors can offer a unique patient cohort to examine the effect of antiestrogen therapy on lung cancer carcinogenesis.

Breast cancer survivors can offer a unique patient cohort to examine the effect of antiestrogen therapy on lung cancer carcinogenesis because many of these women would have received long-term selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) and/or aromatase inhibitors (AIs) as adjuvant treatment. Our hypothesis is that estrogens play a role in lung cancer development, and that antiestrogen therapy would affect the incidence of subsequent lung cancer among breast cancer survivors. Using the Taiwan National Health Insurance (NHI) database, the study included 40,900 survivors of non-metastatic breast cancer after primary surgery, and most antiestrogen users complied well with the medication regimen. We evaluate the effect of antiestrogen therapy on the incidence of subsequent lung cancers. This population-based study revealed that antiestrogen use in breast cancer patients was associated with a reduced risk of subsequent lung cancer in older patients (â‰¥50 years) (HR 0.73, 95%CI 0.54-0.99) when compared with breast cancer survivors who did not use antiestrogens. The study supports the hypothesis that antiestrogen therapy modifies lung cancer carcinogenesis in older women. Further well-designed clinical trials to explore the potential of antiestrogens in lung cancer prevention and treatment would be worthwhile."

There is increasing awareness of the importance of their role during treatment and survivorship. We examined changes in PCP utilization from pre-diagnosis to survival for women diagnosed with breast cancer, factors associated with being a high user of primary care, and variation across four Canadian provinces. The cohorts included women 18+ years of age diagnosed with stage I-III invasive breast cancer in years 2007-2012 in British Columbia (BC), Manitoba (MB), Ontario (ON), and Nova Scotia (NS) who had surgery plus adjuvant chemotherapy and were alive 30+ months after diagnosis (N = 19,589). We compared the rate of PCP visits in each province across phases of care (pre-diagnosis, diagnosis, treatment, and survival years 1 to 4). PCP use was greatest during treatment and decreased with each successive survival year in all provinces. The unadjusted difference in PCP use between treatment and pre-diagnosis was most pronounced in BC where PCP use was six times higher during treatment than pre-diagnosis. Factors associated with being a high user of primary care during treatment included comorbidity and being a high user of care pre-diagnosis in all provinces. These factors were also associated with being a higher user of care during diagnosis and survival. Contrary to the traditional view that PCPs focus primarily on cancer prevention and early detection, we found that PCPs are involved in the care of women diagnosed with breast cancer across all phases of care."

Such models can be used in a variety of settings for prevention, screening, and guiding investigations and treatments. Models aimed at predicting future disease risk that contains lifestyle factors may be of particular use for targeting health promotion activities at an individual level. This type of cancer risk prediction is not yet available in the UK. We have adopted the approach used by the well-established U.S.-derived ""YourCancerRisk"" model for use in the UK population, which allow users to quantify their individual risk of developing individual cancers relative to the population average risk. The UK version of ""YourCancerRisk"" computes 10-year cancer risk estimates for 11 cancers utilizing UK figures for prevalence of risk factors and cancer incidence. Because the prevalence of risk factors and the incidence rates for cancer are different between the U.S. and the UK population, this UK model provides more accurate estimates of risks for a UK population. Using an example of breast cancer and data from UK Biobank cohort, we demonstrate that the individual risk factor estimates are similar for the U.S. and UK populations. Assessment of the performance and validation of the multivariate model predictions based on a binary score confirm the model's applicability. The model can be used to estimate absolute and relative cancer risk for use in Primary Care and community settings and is being used in the community to guide lifestyle change. <i>Cancer Prev Res; 10(7); 421-30.

Prophylactic surgery is considered the best prophylaxis among BRCA1/BRCA2 carriers.,"There are no effective methods of diagnosis of early-stage ovarian cancer. Conservative care over patients at high risk of ovarian and breast cancers is ineffective. Prophylactic surgery is considered the best prophylaxis among BRCA1/BRCA2 carriers. One hundred ninety-five patients, carriers of one of three most common mutations of the BRCA1 gene (Am J Hum Genet: 66: (6)1963-1968, 2000) in the Polish population (5382insC, 4153delA and C61G), who undergone prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomy. The study group consisted of consecutive mutation carriers living in Poland, in the West Pomeranian province. Histopathological examination of the surgical material failed to reveal presence of malignancy. During follow-up we diagnosed two peritoneal cancers and 14 breast cancers. Diagnosis of breast cancer before prophylactic surgery increased the risk of peritoneal cancer almost three times. Time from diagnosis of breast cancer to prophylactic surgery increased the risk of peritoneal cancer after prophylactic surgery. This was strongly expressed (HR = 5.0; p = 0.030) in cases of over five-year-long delay in prophylactic surgery. Diagnosis of breast cancer before prophylactic surgery correlated with the risk of death (p = 0.00010). Presence of 5382insC mutation decreased and C61G mutation increased the risk of peritoneal cancer (p = 0.049 vs. p = 0.013). Occurrence of primary peritoneal cancer after prophylactic surgery is similar to that reported in international literature. Primary breast cancer occurred less often than in international literature. We suspect that the risk of development of breast cancer among BRCA1 carriers undergoing prophylactic surgery can differ in a population. The next goal should be to study the molecular basis for the risk of development of malignancies in any population. Carriers of BRCA1 gene diagnosed with breast cancer should undergo prophylactic surgery within five years from the diagnosis of breast cancer."
Screening for cervical and breast cancer: is obesity an unrecognized barrier to preventive care?,"Wee, McCarthy, Davis, Phillips","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10787362/,"Overweight and obese women less likely to be screened for cervical and breast cancer with Pap smears and mammography. Compared with thinner women, obese women have higher mortality rates for breast and cervical cancer. Obesity leads to adverse social and psychological consequences.","Compared with thinner women, obese women have higher mortality rates for breast and cervical cancer. In addition, obesity leads to adverse social and psychological consequences. Whether obesity limits access to screening for breast and cervical cancer is unclear. To examine the relation between obesity and screening with Papanicolaou (Pap) smears and mammography. Population-based survey. United States. 11 435 women who responded to the ""Year 2000 Supplement"" of the 1994 National Health Interview Survey. Screening with Pap smears and mammography was assessed by questionnaire. In women 18 to 75 years of age who had not previously undergone hysterectomy (n = 8394), fewer overweight women (78%) and obese women (78%) than normal-weight women (84%) had had Pap smears in the previous 3 years (P < 0.001). After adjustment for sociodemographic information, insurance and access to care, illness burden, and provider specialty, rate differences for screening with Pap smears were still seen among overweight (-3.5% [95% CI, -5.9% to -1.1%]) and obese women (-5.3% [CI, -8.0% to -2.6%]). In women 50 to 75 years of age (n = 3502), fewer overweight women (64%) and obese women (62%) than normal-weight women (68%) had had mammography in the previous 2 years (P < 0.002). After adjustment, rate differences were -2.8% (CI, -6.7% to 0.9%) for overweight women and -5.4% (CI, -10.8% to -0.1%) for obese women. Overweight and obese women were less likely to be screened for cervical and breast cancer with Pap smears and mammography, even after adjustment for other known barriers to care. Because overweight and obese women have higher mortality rates for cervical and breast cancer, they should be targeted for increased screening."

The study represents an advance on previous research in this field because, in addition to including data on rurality, it incorporates additional contextual covariates describing aspects of health care accessibility. Individual-level data were obtained from the 2002 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). The county of residence reported by BRFSS respondents was used to link BRFSS data with county-level measures of health care access from the 2004 Area Resource File (ARF). Analyses of mammography were limited to women aged 40 years with known county of residence (n=91,492). Analyses of Pap testing were limited to women aged 18 years with no history of hysterectomy and known county of residence (n=97,820). In addition to individual-level covariates such as race, Hispanic ethnicity, health insurance coverage and routine physical exam in the previous year. We examined county-level covariates (residence in health professional shortage area, urban/rural continuum, racial/ethnic composition, and number of health centers/clinics, mammography screening centers, primary care physicians, and obstetrician-gynecologists per 100,000 female population or per 1000 square miles) as predictors of cancer screening. Both individual-level and contextual covariates are associated with the use of breast and cervical cancer screening. In the current study, covariates associated with health care access, such as health insurance coverage, household income, Black race, and percentage of county female population who were non-Hispanic Black, were important determinants of screening use. In multivariate analysis, we found significant interactions between individual-level covariates and contextual covariates. Among women who reside in areas with lower primary care physician supply, rural women are less likely than urban women to have had a recent Pap test. Black women were more likely than White women to have had a recent Pap test. Women with a non-rural county of residence were more likely to have had a recent mammogram than rural women. A significant interaction was also found between individual-level race and number of health centers or clinics per 100,000 population (p-value=0.0187). In counties with 2 or more health centers or clinics per 100,000 female population, Black women were more likely than White women to have had a recent mammogram. A significant interaction was also observed between the percentage of county female population who were Hispanic and the percentage who were non-Hispanic Black."
"Cancer incidence, mortality and survival trends in Canada, 1970-2007.","Kachuri, De, Ellison, Semenciw,","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23470172/,Analysis examines long-term trends for selected cancers in Canada. Incidence rates for all primary cancer cases combined increased 0.9% per year in males. Mortality rates were characterized by significant declines for all cancers combined.,"Monitoring cancer trends can help evaluate progress in cancer control while reinforcing prevention activities. This analysis examines long-term trends for selected cancers in Canada using data from national databases. Annual changes in trends for age-standardized incidence and mortality rates between 1970 and 2007 were examined by sex for 1) all cancers combined, 2) the four most common cancers (prostate, breast, lung, colorectal) and 3) cancers that demonstrate the most recent notable changes in trend. Five-year relative survival for 1992-2007 was also calculated. Incidence rates for all primary cancer cases combined increased 0.9% per year in males and 0.8% per year in females over the study period, with varying degrees of increase for melanoma, thyroid, liver, prostate, kidney, colorectal, lung, breast, and bladder cancers and decrease for larynx, oral, stomach and cervical cancers. Mortality rates were characterized by significant declines for all cancers combined and for most cancers examined except for melanoma and female lung cancer. The largest improvements in cancer survival were for prostate, liver, colorectal and kidney cancers. While the overall trends in mortality rates and survival point to notable successes in cancer control, the increasing trend in incidence rates for some cancers emphasize the need for continued efforts in prevention."
Development and psychometric testing of the coping with breast cancer threat instrument.,Lancaster,"Evaluation Study, Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15916318/,The Coping with Breast Cancer Threat instrument (CBCT) was designed to measure primary prevention and early detection coping strategies used by women with family histories of breast cancer. The tool's format was modeled after the Jalowiec Coping Scale.,"Women with a positive family history of breast cancer have a higher relative breast cancer risk. Research pertinent to this ""at-risk"" population has focused primarily on the early detection measures of breast self-exam, clinical breast exam, and mammography. Other specific primary prevention coping behaviors have received little research attention and, while there are instruments that measure general coping behaviors in the face of illness threat, there are no known instruments that measure coping behaviors specific to dealing with breast cancer threat. This study tested the psychometric properties of the Coping with Breast Cancer Threat instrument (CBCT). The CBCT was designed to measure primary prevention and early detection coping strategies used by women with family histories of breast cancer in response to their appraised breast cancer threat. The tool's format was modeled after the Jalowiec Coping Scale (JCS) and included use and effectiveness scales. Internal consistency reliabilities and content and construct validity of the CBCT were assessed in a sample of 209 women with a family history of breast cancer. Alpha coefficients for the CBCT's total use and effectiveness scales were .70 and .76, respectively. Principal components factor analysis with a varimax rotation revealed three conceptually relevant subcales that accounted for 52% of the variance in breast cancer threat coping behaviors. The CBCT was shown to be a reliable and valid measure of coping with breast cancer threat in a well-educated, European Amercian sample of middle-aged women."

The Guide to Community Preventive Services previously conducted systematic reviews on the effectiveness of 11 interventions to increase screening for these cancers. This article presents results of updated systematic reviews for nine of these interventions. Five databases were searched for studies published during January 2004-October 2008. Studies had to (1) be a primary investigation of one or more intervention category; (2) be conducted in a country with a high-income economy; (3) provide information on at least one cancer screening outcome of interest; and (4) include screening use prior to intervention implementation or a concurrent group unexposed to the intervention category of interest. Forty-five studies were included in the reviews. Recommendations were added for one-on-one education to increase screening with fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) and group education to increase mammography screening. Strength of evidence for client reminder interventions to increase FOBT screening was upgraded from sufficient to strong. Previous findings and recommendations for reducing out-of-pocket costs (breast cancer screening); provider assessment and feedback (breast, cervical, and FOBT screening); one-on-one education and client reminders (breast and cervical cancer screening); and reducing structural barriers (breast cancer and FOBT screening) were reaffirmed or unchanged. Evidence remains insufficient to determine effectiveness for the remaining screening tests and intervention categories. Findings indicate new and reaffirmed interventions effective in promoting recommended cancer screening, including colorectal cancer screening. Findings can be used in community and healthcare settings to promote recommended care. Important research gaps also are described."
Association of BRCA1 Mutations with Impaired Ovarian Reserve: Connection Between Infertility and Breast/Ovarian Cancer Risk.,"Giordano, Garrett-Mayer, Mittal, Smith, Shulman, Passaglia, Gradishar, Pavone","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27513691/,Recent studies have suggested that the BRCA mutation might be associated with occult primary ovarian insufficiency.

We evaluated 124 women aged 18-45 years in the Northwestern Ovarian Cancer Early Detection and Prevention Program.,"Mutations in the BRCA1/2 genes are associated with breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility. Recent studies have suggested that the BRCA mutation might be associated with occult primary ovarian insufficiency. To evaluate fertility, several studies have validated anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) as a direct biomarker for ovarian aging and it is considered a quantitative marker of ovarian reserve. We hypothesize that BRCA1 gene mutations will be negatively associated with AMH levels. We evaluated 124 women aged 18-45 years participating in the Northwestern Ovarian Cancer Early Detection and Prevention Program. Patients with a history of cancer, ovarian surgery, or exposure to chemotherapy were excluded. Linear and logistic regression modeling were performed to evaluate the association between AMH levels, age, and BRCA1 mutation. In logistic models, the outcome 'low AMH' was defined as AMH <0.05 ng/mL. Logistic regression models were used to adjust for other factors, including body mass index (BMI), duration of birth control (BC), smoking, gravidity, and parity. Women with the BRCA1 mutation had a significant decline in AMH with age (p = 0.0011). BRCA1-positive women >35 years had 10 times the odds of a low AMH (<0.5 ng/mL) compared with women â‰¤35 years. With adjustment for BMI, duration of BC, smoking, gravidity, parity, and age >35, BRCA1 was still strongly associated with a low AMH (p = 0.037). Women >35 with the BRCA1 mutation have a lower AMH, and hence ovarian reserve, than women without a BRCA mutation. Therefore, young adults with the BRCA1 mutation should be counseled regarding this potential decrease in ovarian reserve."
Fertility preservation in female oncology patients.,"Stern, Toledo, Gook, Seymour","Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16441687/,Fertility preservation has not been seen to be an important component of the overall management of these patients.

Despite the high probability of survival, and often good quality of life in female survivors, until recently the concept of fertility preservation has not been seen to be an important component of the overall management of these patients. Over the last few years, various protection and preservation strategies have been developed, which may address potential reproductive concerns. Gametes or embryos may be frozen prior to potentially gonadotoxic cancer therapy, and ovarian tissue may be frozen and stored, with several pregnancies described after subsequent grafting. There is also increasing interest in the possibility of ovarian protection using gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues during chemotherapy, despite the lack of randomised controlled trials. Additionally, there are reports of novel protective strategies, including therapeutic alteration or manipulation of the sphingomyelin pathways. This review summarises methods of fertility protection and preservation currently available, as well as the emergence of promising new strategies."

"History, development and future of cancer screening in Australia.","Olver, Roder",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28765858/,"Australia has three population screening programs: the National Cervical Screening Program (NCSP), BreastScreen Australia and the National Bowel Cancer Screening program. The aim of screening an asymptomatic population for cancer is to achieve better health outcomes. We reviewed the history and development of the three programs.","The aim of screening an asymptomatic population for cancer is to achieve better health outcomes, particularly a population survival benefit. Australia has three population screening programs: the National Cervical Screening Program (NCSP), BreastScreen Australia and the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP). We reviewed the history and development of the three programs. NCSP: Women have a Pap smear every 2 years from age 18-20, or 2 years after first becoming sexually active, until age 69. Since introduction of the NCSP, the cervical cancer incidence has halved, with an approximate 60% decrease in mortality. The screening participation rate approximates 57%, but is lower for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, women in remote areas, and women with lower socio-economic status. The National HPV (human papillomavirus) Vaccination Program, introduced in 2007, is expected to reduce the incidence of cervical cancer by a further 70% and has already reduced the incidence of high-grade lesions in girls. In 2017, testing for HPV every 5 years starting at age 25 will replace the Pap smear as the principal screening test. BreastScreen Australia: This program targets women aged 50-74. Over 20 years, mortality from breast cancer has decreased by 32% in response to screening and treatment advances. The participation rate is 56%. The major adverse impact of breast screening is overdiagnosis, estimated in Australia to be as low as 8% of detected cancers, but with estimates of up to 30% from some research. Women should be made aware of both the potential benefits and harms from screening. Genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in high-risk women leads to earlier screening. The NBCSP uses immunochemical faecal occult blood test (iFOBT) kits on stool samples to detect bleeding from the bowel. When rollout is complete in 2020, test kits will be sent every 2 years to people aged 50-74. People who test positive are followed up with a colonoscopy. The participation rate is currently 37%. The positivity rate is 7%, and stage 1 bowel cancer presentations have tripled since the program began. Research needs to focus on reducing mortality through increased screening participation and, in the future, obtaining guidance for customised screening from genomic testing."
Risk of second primary malignancies among 1537 melanoma patients and risk of second primary melanoma among 52 354 cancer patients in Northern Italy.,"Caini, Radice, Tosti, Spadola, Cocorocchio, Ferrucci, Testori, Pennacchioli, Fargnoli, Palli, Bazolli, Botteri, Gandini",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26990937/,The number of melanoma survivors has been increasing for decades due to early diagnosis and improved survival.

These patients have an increased risk of developing a second primary cancer (SPC); also, melanoma is frequently diagnosed among patients firstly diagnosed with an extracutaneous malignancy. We evaluated the risk of developing a SPC among 1537 melanoma patients, and the risk of second primary melanoma (SPM) in 52 354 extracutaneous cancer patients, who were treated at the European Institute of Oncology in Milan, Italy, during 2000-2010. We calculated standardized incidence ratios (SIR) by applying gender-, age-, year- and region-specific reference rates to the follow-up time accrued between the diagnosis of the first and the second primary malignancies. Seventy-six SPC were diagnosed during a median follow-up of 4 years, of which 49 (64%) during the first 2 years upon melanoma diagnosis. The SIR was increased for cancer of breast (4.10, 95% CI 2.79-6.03), thyroid (4.67, 95% CI 1.94-11.22), brain (6.13, 95% CI 2.30-16.33) and for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (3.12, 95% CI 1.30-7.50). During a median follow-up of 4 years, 127 SPM were diagnosed: thick lesions were less frequent than for melanoma diagnosed as first cancer. The SIR was increased for cancer of breast (5.13, 95%CI 3.91-6.73), thyroid (16.2, 95%CI: 5.22-50.2), head and neck (5.62, 95%CI 1.41-22.50), soft tissue (8.68, 95%CI 2.17-34.70), cervix (12.5, 95% CI 3.14-50.20), kidney (3.19, 95%CI 1.52-6.68), prostate (4.36, 95%CI 2.63-7.24) and acute myeloid leukaemia (6.44, 95%CI 2.42-17.20). The most likely causes of these associations are the clustering of lifestyle risk factors in the same subgroups of population, mainly on a sociocultural basis and surveillance bias. This raises important questions about how to best follow cancer survivors by avoiding an inefficient use of resources and an excessive medicalization of these patients' lives."

Barriers to health (help) seeking included low levels of awareness of the availability of cancer screening and not being able to afford treatment services.,"Low cancer awareness may lead to delays in cancer screening behaviour and diagnosis. We set out to assess public awareness of cancer and perceived barriers to seeking help among the rural population of Murewa district in a cross-sectional survey of 384 conveniently selected respondents. A self-administered and interviewer guided questionnaires were developed with the guide of the Cancer Awareness Measure (CAM) used in public awareness studies. Awareness of the occurrence of cancer in the population was high with 90.1% responding that they had heard about cancer. However, 60.6% of the respondents could not explain what cancer is. An association was identified between educational level and awareness on the existence of cancer in the population (p = 0.001). Age was also associated with awareness of the existence of cancer in the population (p < 0.001). Level of education was also associated with awareness on types of cancers with breast cancer (p = 0.0014), and prostate cancer (p = 0.001). Barriers to health (help) seeking included low levels of awareness of the availability of cancer screening and not being able to afford treatment services. Other barriers to help seeking included fear of screening and the costs of screening services. Unavailability of preventive and curative services for cancer at primary care level was another barrier to help seeking. There is therefore an increasing need for health promotional interventions to raise public awareness of cancer and to create supportive environments for cancer prevention, screening, early detection and treatment."

Participation in research studies can have many benefits for patients. In randomized and controlled clinical studies, they can receive the best possible medical care currently available. However, only a small proportion of patients nowadays are treated within the framework of medical research. The primary endpoint of this study was to discover what level of knowledge patients have about clinical studies and how they currently perceive them, in order to identify ways of optimizing the information provided about studies from the patients' point of view. The study included 2546 patients (breast cancer 21.6%, gynecological cancer 8.3%, obstetrics 32.7%, endometriosis 7.8%, fertility treatment 3.2%, other benign gynecological illnesses 19.2%, no information for 7.2%) in the outpatient clinic (45.2%) and in the in-patient sector (54.8%) at the Department of Gynecology at Erlangen University Hospital and associated centers. In the single-center study, conducted between January 2011 and January 2012, the patients were asked about their level of knowledge regarding the background to medical research studies and the ways in which they are carried out and used. The patients were also asked how they perceived medical studies and how they thought study conditions might be optimized. The three-page questionnaire was included in the feedback sheet received by patients as part of the hospital's quality management system. As a whole, the group only had moderate knowledge about clinical studies. A majority of the respondents considered that studies were valuable (91.6%), but only a few were also willing to take part in them (58.4%). Knowledge and willingness to participate strongly depended on age (P < 0.001), educational level (P < 0.001) and patient group (P < 0.001). Most patients would prefer to decide about participating in studies through a discussion with their outpatient physicians. The information that patients have about clinical studies affects whether they participate in them. It is therefore extremely important for patients to be well informed, for their anxieties about participation to be relieved, and for the benefits of participation to be explained to them."

Data from animal experiments and from epidemiological and endocrinological studies in humans support the hypothesis that the individual hormones which control normal growth of target organs can also create the proper conditions for neoplastic transformation. The concept that hormones can cause, i.e., increase the incidence of, human cancer is most developed for the four hormone-related cancers which are numerically the most important, namely, breast, prostate, endometrium, and ovary. Even for these sites, large gaps remain in our knowledge of the responsible hormones and the conditions which create the optimal opportunity for carcinogenesis. Although scanty, the available epidemiological evidence also suggests a hormonal role in the pathogenesis of testis cancer, thyroid cancer, and osteosarcoma. We believe that the primary prevention of all these cancers will probably depend on modification of the factors which affect the secretion and metabolism of the responsible hormones rather than on control of exposure to classical exogenous initiators."

Although genetic susceptibility to breast cancer in the general population is well studied, large-scale evaluation of breast cancer susceptibility after chest-directed radiotherapy for childhood cancer is lacking. We conducted a genome-wide association study of breast cancer in female survivors of childhood cancer, pooling two cohorts with detailed treatment data and systematic, long-term follow-up: the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study and St. Jude Lifetime Cohort. The study population comprised 207 survivors who developed breast cancer and 2774 who had not developed any subsequent neoplasm as of last follow-up.

We tested associations in the overall population and in subgroups stratified by receipt of lower than 10 and 10 or higher gray breast radiation exposure. We report P values and pooled per-allele risk estimates from Cox proportional hazards regression models. All statistical tests were two-sided. Among survivors who received 10 or higher gray breast radiation exposure, a locus on 1q41 was associated with subsequent breast cancer risk (rs4342822, nearest gene PROX1 , risk allele frequency in control subjects [RAF controls ] = 0.46, hazard ratio = 1.92, 95% confidence interval = 1.49 to 2.44, P = 7.09 Ã— 10 -9 ).

However, relative to primary invasive breast cancers, the immune milieu of breast ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is less understood. Here, we profile tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and expression of the immune checkpoint ligand programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in 27 cases of DCIS with known estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER-2) expression using tissue microarrays. Twenty-four cases were pure DCIS and three had associated invasive ductal carcinoma. Tumors were stained by immunohistochemistry for PD-L1, as well as the lymphocyte markers CD3, CD4, CD8, FoxP3, and CD20. The expression of PD-L1 by DCIS carcinoma cells and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes was determined, and the average tumor infiltrating lymphocytes per high power field were manually scored. None of the DCIS cells expressed PD-L1, but 81% of DCIS lesions contained PD-L1+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. DCIS with moderate-diffuse tumor infiltrating lymphocytes was more likely to have PD-L1+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (P=0.004). Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes with high levels of PD-L1 expression (>50% cells) were seen only in triple-negative DCIS (P=0.0008), and PD-L1-tumor infiltrating lymphocytes were seen only in ER+/HER-2-DCIS (P=0.12). The presence of PD-L1+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes was associated with a younger mean patient age (P=0.01). Further characterization of the DCIS immune microenvironment may identify useful targets for immune-based therapy and breast cancer prevention."

To compare the cancer spectrum and frequencies between male BRCA1 and BRCA2 PV carriers. Retrospective cohort study of 6902 men, including 3651 BRCA1 and 3251 BRCA2 PV carriers, older than 18 years recruited from cancer genetics clinics from 1966 to 2017 by 53 study groups in 33 countries worldwide collaborating through the Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1/2 (CIMBA). Clinical data and pathologic characteristics were collected. BRCA1/2 status was the outcome in a logistic regression, and cancer diagnoses were the independent predictors. All odds ratios (ORs) were adjusted for age, country of origin, and calendar year of the first interview. Among the 6902 men in the study (median [range] age, 51.6 [18-100] years), 1634 cancers were diagnosed in 1376 men (19.9%), the majority (922 of 1,376 [67%]) being BRCA2 PV carriers. Being affected by any cancer was associated with a higher probability of being a BRCA2, rather than a BRCA1, PV carrier (OR, 3.23; 95% CI, 2.81-3.70; P < .001), as well as developing 2 (OR, 7.97; 95% CI, 5.47-11.60; P < .001) and 3 (OR, 19.60; 95% CI, 4.64-82.89; P < .001) primary tumors.

Among cancers other than breast and prostate, pancreatic cancer was associated with a higher probability (OR, 3.00; 95% CI, 1.55-5.81; P = .001) and colorectal cancer with a lower probability (OR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.29-0.78; P = .003) of being a BRCA2 PV carrier. Significant differences in the cancer spectrum were observed in male BRCA2, compared with BRCA1, PV carriers. These data may inform future recommendations for surveillance of BRCA1/2-associated cancers and guide future prospective studies for estimating cancer risks in men with BRCA1/2 PVs."

Detection of SARS-CoV-2-Specific Antibodies in Human Breast Milk and Their Neutralizing Capacity after COVID-19 Vaccination: A Systematic Review.,"Nicolaidou, Georgiou, Christofidou, Felekkis, Pieri, Papaneophytou","Systematic Review, Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36769279/,"SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes the infectious disease Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Until today, none of the authorized vaccines have been approved for use in individuals under six months. antibodies contained in mothers' breastmilk are a critical protective mechanism.","SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes the infectious disease known as Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The severe impact of the virus on humans is undeniable, which is why effective vaccines were highly anticipated. As of 12 January 2022, nine vaccines have obtained Emergency Use Listing by the World Health Organization (WHO), and four of these are approved or authorized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States. The initial clinical trials studying COVID-19 vaccine efficacy excluded pregnant and lactating individuals, meaning that data on the effects of the vaccine on breast milk were lacking. Until today, none of the authorized vaccines have been approved for use in individuals under six months. During the first months of life, babies do not produce their own antibodies; therefore, antibodies contained in their mothers' breastmilk are a critical protective mechanism. Several studies have shown the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the breast milk of women who have been vaccinated or had been naturally infected. However, whether these are protective is still unclear. Additionally, research on the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and the mRNA-1273 vaccine developed by Moderna suggests that these vaccines do not release significant amounts, if any, of mRNA into breast milk. Hence, there is no evidence that vaccination of the mother poses any risk to the breastfed infant, while the antibodies present in breast milk may offer protection against the virus. The primary objective of this systematic review is to summarize the current understanding of the presence of immunoglobulins in human milk that are elicited by SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and to evaluate their ability to neutralize the virus. Additionally, we aim to quantify the side effects experienced by lactating mothers who have been vaccinated, as well as the potential for adverse effects in their infants. This study is critical because it can help inform decision-making by examining the current understanding of antibody secretion in breastmilk. This is particularly important because, although the virus tends to be less severe in younger individuals, infants who contract the disease are at a higher risk of requiring hospitalization compared to older children."

We developed a web-based system, ALCHEMIST, that uses decision models and automatically creates evidence-based guidelines that can be disseminated, tailored and updated over the web. Our objective was to demonstrate the use of this system with clinical scenarios that provide challenges for guideline development. We used the ALCHEMIST system to develop guidelines for three clinical scenarios: (1) Chlamydia screening for adolescent women, (2) antiarrhythmic therapy for the prevention of sudden cardiac death; and (3) genetic testing for the BRCA breast-cancer mutation. ALCHEMIST uses information extracted directly from the decision model, combined with the additional information from the author of the decision model, to generate global guidelines. ALCHEMIST generated electronic web-based guidelines for each of the three scenarios. Using ALCHEMIST, we demonstrate that tailoring a guideline for a population at high-risk for Chlamydia changes the recommended policy for control of Chlamydia from contact tracing of reported cases to a population-based screening programme. We used ALCHEMIST to incorporate new evidence about the effectiveness of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) and demonstrate that the cost-effectiveness of use of ICDs improves from $74 400 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained to $34 500 per QALY gained. Finally, we demonstrate how a clinician could use ALCHEMIST to incorporate a woman's utilities for relevant health states and thereby develop patient-specific recommendations for BRCA testing; the patient-specific recommendation improved quality-adjusted life expectancy by 37 days. The ALCHEMIST system enables guideline developers to publish both a guideline and an interactive decision model on the web. This web-based tool enables guideline developers to tailor guidelines systematically, to update guidelines easily, and to make the underlying evidence and analysis transparent for users."
Epidemiology of cancer in the United States.,Cresanta,"Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1410056/,"Malignant neoplasms are responsible for more than half a million deaths annually and 22.5% of all deaths in the United States. Office screening is the traditional method for identifying cancer victims as early as possible. A suitable screening test should be rapid, simple and inexpensive.","Malignant neoplasms are responsible for more than half a million deaths annually and 22.5% of all deaths in the United States. Cancer is the second leading cause of death overall and the leading cause of death among Americans aged 35-64. Within the next decade it may become the leading cause of death. Cancers of digestive and respiratory organs are responsible for 53% of all cancer deaths. Certain subgroups are at elevated risk for various cancers. For example, sun-sensitive or excessively sun-exposed young white adults, young black women, and elderly patients are at increased risk for cutaneous melanoma, breast cancer, and colon cancer, respectively. Black men have the greatest risk for both lung cancer and cancer of the prostate. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia and solid tumors of the brain and nervous system are the most frequent forms of malignancy occurring among children less than or equal to 14 years. Office screening is the traditional method for identifying cancer victims as early as possible. A suitable screening test should be rapid, simple, inexpensive, and impose minimal discomfort. There must be a window of opportunity available to identify the cancer during a detectable preclinical phase, and therapeutic modalities must be available to alter progression. An office screening test for cancer may have any one of four outcomes, and three of them are bad. False negatives are the worst adverse outcome because cancer remains undetected despite screening. An epidemic of lung cancer, caused by cigarette smoking, is occurring in all race and sex groups. If Americans stopped smoking, 87% of lung cancer deaths could be prevented. Tobacco abuse also is a major risk factor for cancer of the esophagus, larynx, and oral cavity. Cigarette smoking is a contributing factor for cancer of the bladder, kidney, and pancreas, and it has been associated with both cervical cancer and cancer of the stomach. Smoking and smokeless tobacco cessation endorsements, messages, and programs must be part of routine disease prevention and health promotion activities in every primary care practice. More than 1 million Americans became new cancer victims last year, and more than 1 million additional cases will be detected this year. Because of the striking variability in state and regional patterns of various forms of cancer, geographic location of a practice may influence the frequency of cancers seen. Four sites (breast, prostate, lung, colon, and rectum) were responsible for 55% of cancer mortality and 56% of all new cases of cancer detected during 1991.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Materials and Methods Screening examinations (magnetic resonance [MR] imaging and mammography) for women at increased breast cancer risk (January 1, 2003, to January 1, 2014) were evaluated. Risk category, age, recall for workup of screening-detected abnormalities, biopsy, and histopathologic diagnosis were recorded. Recall rate, biopsy rate, positive predictive value of recall, positive predictive value of biopsy, cancer detection rate, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated for first and follow-up rounds. Results There were 8818 MR and 6245 mammographic examinations performed in 2463 women. Documented were 170 cancers; of these, there were 129 screening-detected cancers, 16 interval cancers, and 25 cancers discovered at prophylactic mastectomy. Overall sensitivity was 75.9% including the cancers discovered at prophylactic mastectomy (95% confidence interval: 69.5%, 82.4%) and 90.0% excluding those cancers (95% confidence interval: 83.3%, 93.7%). Sensitivity was lowest for carriers of the BRCA1 mutation (66.1% and 81.3% when including and not including cancers in prophylactic mastectomy specimens, respectively). Specificity was higher at follow-up (96.5%; 95% confidence interval: 96.0%, 96.9%) than in first rounds (85.1%; 95% confidence interval: 83.4%, 86.5%) and was high for both MR imaging (97.1%; 95% confidence interval: 96.7%, 97.5%) and mammography (98.7%; 95% confidence interval: 98.3%, 99.0%). Positive predictive value of recall and positive predictive value of biopsy were lowest in women who had only a family history of breast cancer. Conclusion Screening performance was dependent on risk category. Sensitivity was lowest in carriers of the BRCA1 mutation. The specificity of high-risk breast screening improved at follow-up rounds. <sup>Â©</sup> RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article."
Reducing febrile neutropenia rates in early breast cancer.

The resultant reduction in FN rate is thought to maintain dose intensity and improve patient experience.,"Primary prophylaxis with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is used in many institutions across the UK due to unacceptable febrile neutropenia (FN) rates with FEC-D (fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide-docetaxel). The resultant reduction in FN rate is thought to maintain dose intensity and improve patient experience. This retrospective study was performed to assess whether the addition of G-CSF primary prophylaxis into daily clinical practice has achieved these aims. Collaborative audit performed in two UK cancer centres before and after the integration of G-CSF primary prophylaxis with FEC-D. The primary objective was FN rate. Data from 342 patients were analysed, 151 before routine use of primary G-CSF and 191 after. The FN rates were 30 and 11%, respectively. Despite the 99% adherence to primary G-CSF policy, there were more dose reductions (8 increased to 13%) and dose delays (11 increased to 23%) following the use of G-CSF primary prophylaxis. This appeared to be due to non-FN toxicities. Inpatient days decreased substantially from 93 to 16 and antibiotic courses from 28 to 13 (per hundred patients). Near universal adherence to the G-CSF policy in FEC-D treatment has led to a reduction in FN rate and inpatient days but has not translated into improved dose intensity. This collaborative audit allows sufficient data to give insight into current practice and generate hypotheses for further investigation."

In Mersin province in our country, local health authorities launched an education program on sexual diseases and breast cancer early detection for women over 15 years of age. After the educational session, clinical breast examination was offered by a nurse or physician, and if suspicious they were recommended to apply a specialist for further examination. Here, we report the results on those women with abnormal clinical breast examination. In this second project, socio-demographic variables were investigated such as educational level and place of living,parameters to measure the success of previous project, whether they followed the recommendation themselves, whether mammograms were reported in accordance with Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BIRADS). Of 3,793 women recruited, mean age was 42.2 years, 42.3%were younger than 40.0 years. Majority (88.5%) were married, graduate of primary school (60.6%), without a job(91.2%), and inhabiting in the province (38.7%). Of the population, 98.1% believe in the importance of screening in the treatment of breast cancer. According to 70.3%,monthly breast self-examination enables early detection, 33.5% believe that clinical breast examination detects cancer early, and 35.5% think that annual mammography can detect it early. Among 2,183 women 40 years of age or over, 41.5% had mammography at once before participating in the first project. Breast self-examination was being carried out by 56.6% on a monthly basis. After an abnormal breast examination, 86.4% applied to hospitals for specialist examination. Reasons for declining to seek for further examination among 410 women answering were as follows:42.0% did not accept, 27.0% did not know it was important, 16.6% because of economical reasons, and 5.0% were too shy to be examined. Being older, being married, being the graduate of primary and secondary school, residing in rural areas, having a mammogram positively affected the decision in univariate analyses (p<0.05). All but educational level (p=0.059) remained significant in multivariate analysis. Mammography was reported in accordance with BIRADS in only 45 (1.2%). Awareness of population on breast cancer early detection can be raised through education. Generally, women follow professional recommendation from professionals. Mammography reporting among radiologist in accordance with BIRADS is rare. Successful early detection of breast cancer may be obtained by public education together with improving detection methods."
Cost-effectiveness analysis of breast cancer control interventions in Peru.,"Zelle, Vidaurre, Abugattas, Manrique, Sarria, Jeronimo, Seinfeld, Lauer, Sepulveda, Venegas, Baltussen","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24349314/,"In Peru, a country with constrained health resources, breast cancer control is characterized by late stage treatment and poor survival.

To support breast cancer control in Peru, this study aims to determine the cost-effectiveness of different breast cancer control interventions relevant for the Peruvian context. We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) according to WHO-CHOICE guidelines, from a healthcare perspective. Different screening, early detection, palliative, and treatment interventions were evaluated using mathematical modeling. Effectiveness estimates were based on observational studies, modeling, and on information from Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades NeoplÃ¡sicas (INEN). Resource utilizations and unit costs were based on estimates from INEN and observational studies. Cost-effectiveness estimates are in 2012 United States dollars (US$) per disability adjusted life year (DALY) averted. The current breast cancer program in Peru ($8,426 per DALY averted) could be improved through implementing triennial or biennial screening strategies. These strategies seem the most cost-effective in Peru, particularly when mobile mammography is applied (from $4,125 per DALY averted), or when both CBE screening and mammography screening are combined (from $4,239 per DALY averted). Triennially, these interventions costs between $63 million and $72 million per year. Late stage treatment, trastuzumab therapy and annual screening strategies are the least cost-effective. Our analysis suggests that breast cancer control in Peru should be oriented towards early detection through combining fixed and mobile mammography screening (age 45-69) triennially. However, a phased introduction of triennial CBE screening (age 40-69) with upfront FNA in non-urban settings, and both CBE (age 40-49) and fixed mammography screening (age 50-69) in urban settings, seems a more feasible option and is also cost-effective. The implementation of this intervention is only meaningful if awareness raising, diagnostic, referral, treatment and basic palliative services are simultaneously improved, and if financial and organizational barriers to these services are reduced."
Does exclusive breast-feeding reduce the risk of coeliac disease in children?,Nash,"Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12682607/,The aim of this review was to identify if exclusive breast-feeding reduced the risk of coeliac disease (CD) in children. The design of these studies did not allow a causal relationship to be established. Evidence from these studies suggests a delay in the onset of CD in breast-fed children.,"The aim of this review was to identify if exclusive breast-feeding reduced the risk of coeliac disease (CD) in children. Medline, Embase and CINAHL databases were searched for cohort studies and case control studies that compared exclusive breast-feeding rates with formula or mixed (breast and formula) of the same duration. Three case control studies met the review criteria and were included in the review. The results from these studies show that there is a reduced risk in the onset of CD in those children who were exclusively breast-fed compared to those who were not. However, the design of these studies did not allow a causal relationship to be established. The evidence from these studies suggests a delay in the onset of CD in breast-fed children, however it cannot be ruled out that breast-feeding continues to have a protective factor in adolescence and adulthood. The exact role of breast-feeding in CD prevention needs to be clarified: is it a protective factor against CD, or does it delay the appearance of clinical symptoms? Parents should continue to be encouraged and supported with breast-feeding, as it is the best form of infant nutrition and protective against short and long-term health outcomes."

This complication is associated with significant impact on patient outcomes and healthcare costs. The optimal closure approach for seroma prevention remains unknown but some evidence suggests that quilting suture of the dead space could lower the incidence of seroma. The aim of this trial is to compare seroma formation using quilting suture versus conventional closure with drainage in patients undergoing mastectomy. This is a multicentre, superiority, randomised controlled trial in women undergoing mastectomy with or without axillary involvement. Exclusion criteria include indication of bilateral mastectomy or immediate reconstruction and any physical or psychiatric condition that could impair patient's ability to cooperate with postoperative data collection or that do not allow an informed consent. 320 participants will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either quilting suture or conventional wound closure with drain. The primary outcome is seroma requiring either aspiration or surgical intervention within 21 days following mastectomy. Secondary outcomes include seroma regardless of whether or not it requires an intervention, surgical site infection, pain score, cosmetic result, patient's quality of life, costs and cost-effectiveness. The primary analysis will be an intention-to treat analysis performed with a Ï‡(2) test (or Fisher's exact test). Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants. This study was approved by Tours Research ethics committee (CPP TOURS-Region Centre-Ouest 1, 2014-R20, 16 December 2014). Study findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at relevant national and international breast cancer conferences. NCT02263651."
Disparities in Risk Reduction Therapy Recommendations for Young Women With Lobular Carcinoma In-Situ.,"Bandera, Voci, Nelson, Stern, Barrak, Fischer, DiNome, Goldfarb",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32081572/,Endocrine therapy (ET) significantly reduces the risk of breast cancer development in high-risk patients with lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) The variables impacting recommendation and use of ET in young adults (YAs) is not well-studied. We examined the role of provider recommendation and patient acceptance for ET for YAs with LCIS.,"Endocrine therapy (ET) significantly reduces the risk of breast cancer development in high-risk patients diagnosed with lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS). However, the variables impacting recommendation and use of ET in young adults (YAs) is not well-studied. We examined the role of provider recommendation and patient acceptance for ET for YAs with LCIS. The National Cancer Database was queried for women aged < 40 years with primary LCIS between 2000 and 2012. Socioeconomic, demographic, and treatment variables were examined to determine their impact on ET provider recommendation and initial patient acceptance of risk-reducing therapy. Among 1650 YA patients with LCIS, only 749 (45.4%) were recommended ET. On multivariable analysis, women > 30 years of age were more likely recommended ET than women < 30 years (odds ratio [OR], 1.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-2.47), African Americans more than other ethnicities (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.1-2.0), and YAs treated in New England were more likely than those in the rest of the country (OR, 3.26; 95% CI, 2.0-5.2). Among YA women recommended ET, only 20.2% had a documented refusal. Only geography appeared to independently impact the likelihood of refusal, with YAs in the Southeastern-Central United States being most likely to refuse ET (OR, 5.4; 95% CI, 1.2-24.0). ET is underutilized for risk-reduction in YAs with LCIS. This underuse appears dependent on disparities in provider recommendation practices rather than non-acceptance of therapy. This may reflect regional practice patterns, community standards of care, or provider bias regarding the significance of LCIS as a risk factor for development of invasive cancer."

To clarify the role of CASP8 in breast cancer susceptibility, we carried out dense genotyping of this region in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC). Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning a 1 Mb region around CASP8 were genotyped in 46 450 breast cancer cases and 42 600 controls of European origin from 41 studies participating in the BCAC as part of a custom genotyping array experiment (iCOGS). Missing genotypes and SNPs were imputed and, after quality exclusions, 501 typed and 1232 imputed SNPs were included in logistic regression models adjusting for study and ancestry principal components. The SNPs retained in the final model were investigated further in data from nine genome-wide association studies (GWAS) comprising in total 10 052 case and 12 575 control subjects. The most significant association signal observed in European subjects was for the imputed intronic SNP rs1830298 in ALS2CR12 (telomeric to CASP8), with per allele odds ratio and 95% confidence interval [OR (95% confidence interval, CI)] for the minor allele of 1.05 (1.03-1.07), P = 1 Ã— 10(-5). Three additional independent signals from intronic SNPs were identified, in CASP8 (rs36043647), ALS2CR11 (rs59278883) and CFLAR (rs7558475). The association with rs1830298 was replicated in the imputed results from the combined GWAS (P = 3 Ã— 10(-6)), yielding a combined OR (95% CI) of 1.06 (1.04-1.08), P = 1 Ã— 10(-9). Analyses of gene expression associations in peripheral blood and normal breast tissue indicate that CASP8 might be the target gene, suggesting a mechanism involving apoptosis."

Using a large commercial administrative database, we identified annual cohorts of adult patients diagnosed with breast or lung cancer, or non-Hodgkin lymphoma and initiating myelosuppressive chemotherapy during 2005-2017. We described yearly changes in proportions of myelosuppressive chemotherapy by febrile neutropenia risk category (high, intermediate, unclassified) and proportion of prophylactic colony-stimulating factor use and unadjusted incidence of neutropenia-related hospitalization in the first cycle of myelosuppressive chemotherapy. Annual cohorts included 4383-5888 eligible patients during 2005-2017. The proportion of eligible patients aged â‰¥ 65 years increased from 26.0% in 2005 to 58.2% in 2017.

In multivariate Cox proportional hazards models, high school intakes of total fat and types of fat were not associated with proliferative BBD. Women in the highest quintile of total retinol activity equivalents (RAEs), which incorporate retinol, Î±- and Î²-carotene, and Î²-cryptoxanthin intakes, had a 17 % lower risk of proliferative BBD than those in the lowest quintile [multivariate hazard ratio (HR) 95 % CI 0.83 (0.64, 1.07), p trend = 0.01]; however, additional adjustment for high school dietary factors (vitamin D, nuts, and fiber) rendered the association nonsignificant [0.99 (0.73, 1.34), p trend = 0.32]. Results were similar with additional adjustment for adult RAE intake. Intakes of vitamin E and individual carotenoids were not associated with proliferative BBD, although an inverse association cannot be ruled out. In this study, adolescent fat and micronutrient intakes were not associated with risk of proliferative BBD."

The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of Breast Self Examination (BSE) against examination conducted by the trained health personnel. A descriptive evaluative study was conducted among women aged 15 to 60 years undertaken in urban and rural areas. It was a population-based study and non-probability sampling method was used for data collection. Respondents conducted Breast Self Examination on their own, and then investigators did clinical examination of breasts of the respondents to verify their findings. Mean age of the respondents was 34.54 +/- 9.12 years. Nearly half (44.8%) of the respondents were illiterate. On comparison of each variable of breast self- examination with the physical examination of breast, it was observed that size of the breasts and lump found in the breast had significant relation to performance during examination (P<0.1). The result of Kappa test showed 68% agreement between findings of examinations done by the experts and respondents. Breast Self Examination can be used as an important tool for primary prevention of breast cancer in Nepal, where sophisticated method like screening mammography for general public cannot afford."

This study aimed to provide information about women's understanding of breast cancer incidence and risk of disease. Based on a newly developed questionnaire 2108 healthy women were asked about their knowledge and perceptions in relation to breast cancer incidence, risk factors, risk perception and level of concern. Of these women 78.8% were well aware of breast cancer in general terms. However, there were major aspects such as incidence or risk factors that were poorly understood. Only one-third correctly estimated the incidence of breast cancer; 95% understood breast cancer in the familial history as a risk factor, but only 57% understood the age risk; 37.1% of women perceived hormonal contraceptives and 35.9% hormonal replacement therapy as risk factors of breast cancer. The latter estimation was significantly higher in women above 40 years. Recommendations for the improvement of cancer prevention programmes include targeting understanding of lifetime risk of breast cancer, age as a risk factor, survival from breast cancer or hormonal factors. There is a need to separately address the perceptions of women depending on age, social status and educational levels."

Various socioeconomic indicators have been identified as potential factors for disparities in breast, cervical and colorectal cancer screening uptake. We aimed to identify the socioeconomic inequalities, which persisted in screening uptake for these cancers, and to quantify these disparities over a 5-year period. The Cancer Barometer was a population-based-survey carried out in 2005 and 2010 in France. A randomly selected sample of participants aged 15-85 years (n=3820 in 2005 and n=3727 in 2010) were interviewed on their participation in breast, cervical and colorectal cancer screening-programmes and their socioeconomic profile. For each type of screening programme, we calculated participation rates, OR and relative inequality indices (RII) for participation, derived from logistic regression of the following socioeconomic variables: income, education, occupation, employment and health insurance. Changes in participation between 2005 and 2010 were then analysed. Participation rates for breast and colorectal screening increased significantly among the majority of socioeconomic categories, whereas for cervical cancer screening there were no significant changes between 2005 and 2010. RIIs for income remained significant for cervical smear in 2005 (RII=0.25, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.48) and in 2010 (RII=0.31, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.64). RIIs for education in mammography (RII=0.43, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.98) and cervical smear (RII=0.36, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.64) were significant in 2005 and remained significant for cervical smear (RII=0.40, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.74) in 2010. There was a persistence of socioeconomic inequalities in the uptake of opportunistic cervical cancer screening. Conversely, organised screening programmes for breast and colorectal cancer saw a reduction in relative socioeconomic inequalities, even though the results were not statistically significant. The findings suggest that organised cancer screening programmes may have the potential to reduce socioeconomic disparities in participation."

The timing of pubertal events may have broad implications for chronic disease risks in aging women. Here we tested for associations of recalled menarcheal age with risks of 19 cancers in 536,450 women [median age, 60 years (range, 31-39 years)] in nine prospective U.S. and European cohorts that enrolled participants from 1981 to 1998. Cox regression estimated multivariable-adjusted HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations of the age at menarche with risk of each cancer in each cohort and random-effects meta-analysis was used to generate summary estimates for each cancer. Over a median 10 years of follow-up, 60,968 women were diagnosed with a first primary incident cancer. Inverse linear associations were observed for seven of 19 cancers studied. Each additional year in the age at menarche was associated with reduced risks of endometrial cancer (HR = 0.91; 95% CI, 0.89-0.94), liver cancer (HR = 0.92; 95% CI, 0.85-0.99), melanoma (HR = 0.95; 95% CI, 0.93-0.98), bladder cancer (HR = 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93-0.99), and cancers of the colon (HR = 0.97; 95% CI, 0.96-0.99), lung (HR = 0.98; 95% CI, 0.96-0.99), and breast (HR = 0.98; 95% CI, 0.93-0.99). All but one of these associations remained statistically significant following adjustment for baseline body mass index. Similarities in the observed associations between menarche and seven cancers suggest shared underlying causes rooted early in life. We propose as a testable hypothesis that early exposure to sex hormones increases mid-life cancer risks by altering functional capacities of stem cells with roles in systemic energy balance and tissue homeostasis. SIGNIFICANCE: Age at menarche is associated with risk for seven cancers in middle-aged women, and understanding the shared underlying causal pathways across these cancers may suggest new avenues for cancer prevention."

The aim of the study is to create and validate a questionnaire to identify individuals with possible risk for hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes (HCPS), using different strategies in a Cancer Prevention Service in Brazil. The primary screening questionnaire (PSQ) was developed to identify families at-risk for HCPS. The PSQ was validated using discrimination measures, and the reproducibility was estimated through kappa coefficient. Patients with at least one affirmative answer had the pedigree drawn using three alternative interview approaches: in-person, by telephone, or letter. Validation of these approaches was done. Kappa and intraclass correlation coefficients were used to analyze data's reproducibility considering the presence of clinical criteria for HCPS. The PSQ was applied to a convenience sample of 20,000 women of which 3121 (15.6%) answered at least one affirmative question and 1938 had their pedigrees drawn. The PSQ showed sensitivity and specificity scores of 94.4% and 75%, respectively, and a kappa of 0.64. The strategies for pedigree drawing had reproducibility coefficients of 0.976 and 0.850 for the telephone and letter approaches, respectively. Pedigree analysis allowed us to identify 465 individuals (24.0%) fulfilling at least one clinical criterion for HCPS. The PSQ fulfills its function, allowing the identification of HCPS at-risk families. The use of alternative screening methods may reduce the number of excluded at-risk individuals/families who live in locations where oncogenetic services are not established."

Despite various studies regarding breast self-examination practices conducted among health professionals and students in Ethiopia, limited information was found on women attending health care services in the pastoralist community. This study aimed to identify the determinants of breast self-examination practice (BSE) among women attending pastoralist health facilities in Southern Ethiopia. An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 421 women who were attending family planning services in pastoralist health facilities in South Omo Zone, Southern Ethiopia from January to February 2022 using systematic random sampling to select a woman from each health facility in Jinka town. Data were collected using structured, pretested, and interviewer-administered questionnaires. Descriptive statistics such as proportions, means, and standard deviations were used to describe each relevant variable. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify the determinants of BSE practices among women. The mean age of the women was 25.43 Â± 6.66 years. Fifty-four percent (n = 173) of the women had heard of BSE from health professionals. Eighty-nine (21.1%) women had undergone BSE. Women who resided in the urban areas (AOR = 6.79, CI: 3.40, 13.56), attained at least primary education and above (AOR = 8.96, CI: 4.14, 19.35), heard about BSE (AOR = 4.07, CI: 2.07, 7.98), and had a family history of breast cancer (AOR = 7.46, CI = 3.27, 17.00) were significantly associated with BSE practice. Our study showed that women's practice of BSE was lower when compared with the local studies. We recommend health care professionals and others working in the area improve ways of increasing awareness about breast cancer, including its risk, and the need for BSE."

We assessed the association of social complexity factors with the quality of care patients received in primary care settings. Eleven social complexity factors were defined using administrative data on poverty, mental health, newcomer status, and justice system involvement from the Manitoba Population Research Data Repository. We measured the distribution of these factors among primary care patients who made at least 3 visits during 2010-2013 to clinicians in Manitoba, Canada. Using generalized linear mixed modeling, we measured 26 primary care indicators to compare the quality of care received by patients with 0 to 5 or more social complexity factors. Among 626,264 primary care patients, 54% were living with at least 1 social complexity factor, and 4% were living with 5 or more. Social complexity factors were strongly associated with poorer outcomes with respect to primary care indicators for prevention (eg, breast cancer screening; odds ratio [OR] = 0.77; 99% CI, 0.73-0.81), chronic disease management (eg, diabetes management; OR = 0.86; 99% CI, 0.79-0.92), geriatric care (eg, benzodiazepine prescriptions; OR = 1.63; 99% CI, 1.48-1.80), and use of health services (eg, ambulatory visits; OR = 1.09; 99% CI, 1.08-1.09). Linking health and social data demonstrates how social determinants are associated with primary care service provision. Our findings provide insight into the social needs of primary care populations, and may support the development of focused interventions to address social complexity in primary care."

Age focus-consistent primary care providers were defined as having a focus concordant with a patient's age: 12-17 years, child or mixed-focus; â‰¥26 years, adult or mixed-focus; 18-25 years, any focus. Differences in healthcare activities were evaluated using Pearson's chi-square, Fisher's exact, and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Analyses were performed in 2015-2017. Of the cohort, 79% had an age focus-consistent primary care provider. However, 40% of adults aged â‰¥26 years received care from a child-focused primary care provider. Only 43% with an age focus-consistent provider had â‰¥1 well examination (age focus-inconsistent primary care provider: 35%, p<0.001). Most preventive activities had poor rates (<50%) regardless of age focus consistency between provider and patient age or whether they were age/sex- or Down syndrome-specific (well examinations; vaccinations; sleep apnea; hearing; and breast, cervical, and colon cancer screenings). Lipids, vision, and thyroid screenings reached moderate levels (50% to <80%). Rates of age/sex- and Down syndrome-specific preventive recommendations were low among adolescents and adults with Down syndrome, regardless of the age focus consistency of their primary care provider. This represents a significant opportunity to improve primary care in this vulnerable population."

To detect genetic modifiers of the association between current use of MHT and BC risk, we conducted a meta-analysis of four genome-wide case-only studies followed by replication in 11 case-control studies. We used a case-only design to assess interactions between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and current MHT use on risk of overall and lobular BC. The discovery stage included 2920 cases (541 lobular) from four genome-wide association studies. The top 1391 SNPs showing P values for interaction (Pint) <3.0 Ã— 10(-3) were selected for replication using pooled case-control data from 11 studies of the Breast Cancer Association Consortium, including 7689 cases (676 lobular) and 9266 controls. Fixed-effects meta-analysis was used to derive combined Pint. No SNP reached genome-wide significance in either the discovery or combined stage. We observed effect modification of current MHT use on overall BC risk by two SNPs on chr13 near POMP (combined Pintâ‰¤8.9 Ã— 10(-6)), two SNPs in SLC25A21 (combined Pintâ‰¤4.8 Ã— 10(-5)), and three SNPs in PLCG2 (combined Pintâ‰¤4.5 Ã— 10(-5)). The association between lobular BC risk was potentially modified by one SNP in TMEFF2 (combined Pintâ‰¤2.7 Ã— 10(-5)), one SNP in CD80 (combined Pintâ‰¤8.2 Ã— 10(-6)), three SNPs on chr17 near TMEM132E (combined Pintâ‰¤2.2Ã—10(-6)), and two SNPs on chr18 near SLC25A52 (combined Pintâ‰¤4.6 Ã— 10(-5)). In conclusion, polymorphisms in genes related to solute transportation in mitochondria, transmembrane signaling, and immune cell activation are potentially modifying BC risk associated with current use of MHT. These findings warrant replication in independent studies."
"Cancer incidence in Ghana, 2012: evidence from a population-based cancer registry.","Laryea, Awuah, Amoako, Osei-Bonsu, Dogbe, Larsen-Reindorf, Ansong, Yeboah-Awudzi, Oppong, Konney, Boadu, Nguah, Titiloye, Frimpong, Awittor, Martin","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24884730/,Population-based cancer registries are not common in developing countries. The Kumasi Cancer Registry was established in Ghana in 2012. It provides information on cancer cases seen in the city of Kumasi. The majority of cancers were recorded among females accounting for 69.6%.,"Data on cancers is a challenge in most developing countries. Population-based cancer registries are also not common in developing countries despite the usefulness of such registries in informing cancer prevention and control programmes. The availability of population-based data on cancers in Africa varies across different countries. In Ghana, data and research on cancer have focussed on specific cancers and have been hospital-based with no reference population. The Kumasi Cancer Registry was established as the first population-based cancer registry in Ghana in 2012 to provide information on cancer cases seen in the city of Kumasi. This paper reviews data from the Kumasi Cancer Registry for the year 2012. The reference geographic area for the registry is the city of Kumasi as designated by the 2010 Ghana Population and Housing Census. Data was from all clinical departments of the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, Pathology Laboratory Results, Death Certificates and the Kumasi South Regional Hospital. Data was abstracted and entered into Canreg 5 database. Analysis was conducted using Canreg 5, Microsoft Excel and Epi Info Version 7.1.2.0. The majority of cancers were recorded among females accounting for 69.6% of all cases. The mean age at diagnosis for all cases was 51.6 years. Among males, the mean age at diagnosis was 48.4 compared with 53.0 years for females. The commonest cancers among males were cancers of the Liver (21.1%), Prostate (13.2%), Lung (5.3%) and Stomach (5.3%). Among females, the commonest cancers were cancers of the Breast (33.9%), Cervix (29.4%), Ovary (11.3%) and Endometrium (4.5%). Histology of the primary tumour was the basis of diagnosis in 74% of cases with clinical and other investigations accounting for 17% and 9% respectively. The estimated cancer incidence Age Adjusted Standardised Rate for males was 10.9/100,000 and 22.4/100, 000 for females. This first attempt at population-based cancer registration in Ghana indicates that such registries are feasible in resource limited settings as ours. Strengthening Public Health Surveillance and establishing more Population-based Cancer Registries will help improve data quality and national efforts at cancer prevention and control in Ghana."
Safety and efficacy of aprepitant as mono and combination therapy for the prevention of emetogenic chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting: post-marketing surveillance in China.,"Yang, Yang, Wu, Ouyang, Fang, Li, Liao, Cai, Huang, Li, Zhang, Wang, Zhang, Xu, Zhao, Hu, Li, Zhong, Zhong, Cheng, Ye, Zhong, Wang, Liu, Zheng, Liu, Xu, Zhang","Journal Article, Multicenter Study",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33161724/,"1,000 patients with solid malignancies were enrolled across 21 centers in China. Half of the patients (455/990, 46.0%) received aprepitant as part of a 3-drug anti-CINV regimen consistent with prescribing guidelines.","The goal of this study was to evaluate aprepitant usage in the context of routine clinical practice with dose/regimens at the discretion of prescribers for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) treatments. In this single arm, multicenter prospective study 1,000 patients with solid malignancies were enrolled across 21 centers in China. The primary endpoint was the rate of adverse events (AEs), including drug related AEs and serious AEs (SAEs). Secondary efficacy endpoints included the proportion of patients achieving complete response (CR; no vomiting, no nausea, and no use of rescue medication) within 120 h after highly emetogenic chemotherapy, the rates of no nausea and no vomiting, as well as quality of life (QoL). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was carried out to determine factors associated with the overall (0-120 h), acute (0-24 h) and delayed (25-120 h) CR. Of the 1,000 highly emetogenic chemotherapy treated patients enrolled in the study â‰¥1 AE, â‰¥1 drug related AE, â‰¥1 SAE and drug related SAE rates in 998 patients were 45.9%, 2.5%, 4.0% and 0.1%, respectively. Approximately half of the patients (455/990, 46.0%) received aprepitant as part of a 3-drug anti-CINV regimen consistent with prescribing guidelines. The overall CR (0 to 120 h) for anti-emetic drug use was 41.0%, with an acute CR of 66.0% and a delayed CR of 46.5%. The rates of no vomiting and no nausea after solely aprepitant anti-emetic therapy from 0 to 120 h were 70.9% and 43.0%, for dual anti-emetic therapy 86.9% and 64.6%, and for triple therapy 86.4% and 69.5%, respectively. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that triple anti-emetic therapy (P=0.038), male gender (P<0.001) and a history of chemotherapy (P=0.016) were significantly associated with the overall acute CR. Especially as a combination treatment, aprepitant is safe and efficient for preventing CINV in patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy."

The project addresses young women at increased risk for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome through outreach efforts. The consortium provides education and collects surveillance data using the breast cancer genetics referral screening tool (B-RST) available at www.BreastCancerGeneScreen.org . The HBOC educational protocol was presented to 73 staff in 6 public health centers. Staff used the tool during the collection of medical history. Further family history assessments and testing for mutations in the BRCA1/2 genes were facilitated if appropriate. Data was collected from November 2012 through December 2013, including 2,159 screened women. The majority of patients identified as black/African American and were 18-49 years old. Also, 6.0 % (n = 130) had positive screens, and 60.9 % (n = 67) of the 110 patients who agreed to be contacted provided a detailed family history. A total of 47 patients (42.7 %) met National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines when family history was clarified. Fourteen (12.7 %) underwent genetic testing; 1 patient was positive for a BRCA2 mutation, and 1 patient was found to carry a variant of uncertain significance. The introduction of genomics practice within public health departments has provided access to comprehensive cancer care for uninsured individuals. The successful implementation of the B-RST into public health centers demonstrates the opportunity for integration of HBOC screening into primary care practices."

Community health fairs have developed to address the unmet need for no- and low-cost services that target prevention and education among underserved communities. The current research describes an ongoing effort in a community in Southern California and examines the barriers to health care among participants registering to receive free breast health screenings, one of the major services offered at a 2010 health fair. A total of 186 adult Latina women completed a brief questionnaire assessing their healthcare utilization and self-reported barriers to engaging in preventive and screening services. Approximately two thirds of the participants reported never receiving or having more than 2 years passing since receiving a preventive health check-up. Participants identified cost (64.5%) and knowledge of locations for services (52.3%) as the primary barriers to engaging in routine healthcare services. Engaging with health professionals represents a leading way in which adults obtain health information; health fairs offering cancer health screenings represent a culturally appropriate venue for increased cancer health equity. Implications of the current research for future health fairs and their role in community cancer education are discussed."

The description of mortality data by state, sex, and race/ethnicity is essential for cancer-control researchers to target areas of need and develop programs that reduce the burden of cancer. 1990-2000. Mortality data from CDC were used to calculate death rates and trends, categorized by state, sex, and race/ethnicity. Trend analyses for 1990-2000 are presented for all cancer sites combined and for the four leading cancers causing death (lung/bronchus, colorectal, prostate, and breast) categorized by state, sex, and race/ethnicity. Death rates per 100,000 population for the 10 primary cancer sites with the highest age-adjusted rates are also presented for each state and the District of Columbia by sex. For males, the 10 primary sites include lung/bronchus, prostate, colon/rectum, pancreas, leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, liver/intrahepatic bile duct, esophagus, stomach, and urinary bladder. For females, the 10 primary sites include lung/bronchus, breast, colon/rectum, pancreas, ovary, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, brain/other nervous system, uterine corpus, and myeloma. For 1990-2000, cancer mortality decreased among the majority of racial/ethnic populations and geographic locations in the United States. Statistically significant decreases in mortality among all races combined occurred with lung and bronchus cancer among men (--1.7%/year); colorectal cancer among men and women (--2.0%/year and--1.7%/year, respectively); prostate cancer (--2.6%/year); and female breast cancer (--2.3%/year). For 1990-2000, cancer mortality remained stable among American Indian/Alaska Native populations. Statistically significant increases in lung and bronchus cancer mortality occurred among women of all racial/ethnic backgrounds, except among Asian/Pacific Islanders. Although cancer remains the second leading cause of death in the United States, the overall declining trend in cancer mortality demonstrates considerable progress in cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment. More effective tobacco-cessation programs are necessary to reduce lung and bronchus cancer mortality among women and sustain the decrease in lung and bronchus cancer mortality among men. Additional programs that deter smoking initiation among adolescents are essential to ensure future decreases in lung and bronchus cancer mortality. Continued research in primary prevention, screening methods, and therapeutics is needed to further reduce disparities and improve quality of life and survival among all populations."
Automated telephone communication systems for preventive healthcare and management of long-term conditions.,"Posadzki, Mastellos, Ryan, Gunn, Felix, Pappas, Gagnon, Julious, Xiang, Oldenburg, Car","Journal Article, Meta-Analysis, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Review, Systematic Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27960229/,"ATCS can supplement or replace telephone contact between health professionals and patients.

ATCS can supplement or replace telephone contact between health professionals and patients. There are four different types of ATCS: unidirectional (one-way, non-interactive voice communication), interactive voice response (IVR) systems, ATCS with additional functions such as access to an expert to request advice (ATCS Plus) and multimodal ATCS, where the calls are delivered as part of a multicomponent intervention. To assess the effects of ATCS for preventing disease and managing long-term conditions on behavioural change, clinical, process, cognitive, patient-centred and adverse outcomes. We searched 10 electronic databases (the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; Embase; PsycINFO; CINAHL; Global Health; WHOLIS; LILACS; Web of Science; and ASSIA); three grey literature sources (Dissertation Abstracts, Index to Theses, Australasian Digital Theses); and two trial registries (www.controlled-trials.com; www.clinicaltrials.gov) for papers published between 1980 and June 2015. Randomised, cluster- and quasi-randomised trials, interrupted time series and controlled before-and-after studies comparing ATCS interventions, with any control or another ATCS type were eligible for inclusion. Studies in all settings, for all consumers/carers, in any preventive healthcare or long term condition management role were eligible. We used standard Cochrane methods to select and extract data and to appraise eligible studies. We included 132 trials (N = 4,669,689). Studies spanned across several clinical areas, assessing many comparisons based on evaluation of different ATCS types and variable comparison groups. Forty-one studies evaluated ATCS for delivering preventive healthcare, 84 for managing long-term conditions, and seven studies for appointment reminders. We downgraded our certainty in the evidence primarily because of the risk of bias for many outcomes. We judged the risk of bias arising from allocation processes to be low for just over half the studies and unclear for the remainder. We considered most studies to be at unclear risk of performance or detection bias due to blinding, while only 16% of studies were at low risk. We generally judged the risk of bias due to missing data and selective outcome reporting to be unclear.For preventive healthcare, ATCS (ATCS Plus, IVR, unidirectional) probably increase immunisation uptake in children (risk ratio (RR) 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18 to 1.32; 5 studies, N = 10,454; moderate certainty) and to a lesser extent in adolescents (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.11; 2 studies, N = 5725; moderate certainty). The effects of ATCS in adults are unclear (RR 2.18, 95% CI 0.53 to 9.02; 2 studies, N = 1743; very low certainty).For screening, multimodal ATCS increase uptake of screening for breast cancer (RR 2.17, 95% CI 1.55 to 3.04; 2 studies, N = 462; high certainty) and colorectal cancer (CRC) (RR 2.19, 95% CI 1.88 to 2.55; 3 studies, N = 1013; high certainty) versus usual care. It may also increase osteoporosis screening. ATCS Plus interventions probably slightly increase cervical cancer screening (moderate certainty), but effects on osteoporosis screening are uncertain.

Of 49 240 women, mean age was 59.94 years (standard deviation = 7.14, range = 40-94 years). Most women had consumed alcohol during the past 12 months [41 628, 85.48%, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 85.16, 85.79]. One in five women (8464, 18.34%, 95% CI = 17.99, 18.69) were drinking at a level exceeding new national guidelines for weekly consumption (i.e. greater than 10 standard drinks per week), and one in six (7446, 15.60%, 95% CI = 15.28, 15.93) were exceeding new guidelines for consumption on a single day (i.e. greater than four standard drinks on any 1 day, more than once per month). The proportion of women in this sample drinking daily (4.21-11.19%), weekly (34.73-50.71%) and in the past 12 months (74.96-90.81%) was significantly greater among nearly all age groups (by decade), compared with Australian gender and age norms [drinking daily (3.4-9.1%), weekly (27.1-37.6%) and in the past 12 months (64.4-81.9%)]. There appears to be a high prevalence of risky alcohol consumption among a large convenience sample of breast screening service clients in Australia using new national alcohol guidelines introduced in December 2020."

This study was a cross-sectional study involving 385 women between the ages of 15-49 years. Data were collected with a structured questionnaire and variables included socio-demographic characteristics, breast cancer knowledge, breast self-examination knowledge and practice. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze and present the data and chi square test of significance was used to determine association between socio-demographic variable and practice of breast self-examination. The mean age of the women was 24.54Â±7.19. Only 3.1% of women had no formal education and 58.9% were single. Although 88.3% of the respondents were aware of breast cancer, 64.9% of the respondents had good or sufficient knowledge of breast cancer and only 94(37.6%) practice BSE. Over 50% of the respondents did not know how to perform BSE. There was a significant association between knowledge on breast cancer and practice of BSE (Ï‡2 = 36.218 p = 0.000). The higher the age of a participant, the lower practice of breast self-examination and this was significant (Ï‡2 = 11.324, p = 0.003). Breast self-examination is a key strategy to early detection of breast cancer and subsequently critical for effective treatment and cure of the disease. The findings in this study have shown significant low levels of awareness and practice of breast self-examination among women in Akatsi South district of the Volta region. This pattern may be similar to other rural communities across the region. The need to create awareness and to educate women, especially rural women, on importance of breast self-examination as preventive measure for breast cancer is paramount."

Most parameters showed that palonosetron and dexamethasone on day 1 only offer chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting protection similar to multiple-day dexamethasone administration. In patients treated with a single injection of palonosetron on day 1, reducing dexamethasone is an option that is not associated with significant reduction in antiemetic control during the 5-day period or an impact on patient functioning."

SLN mapping requires injection of technetium-99m-sulfur colloid-an effective but sometimes painful method, for which better pain-management strategies are needed. In this randomised, double-blind trial, we compared degree of pain between standard radiocolloid injection and pH-adjusted and lidocaine-supplemented formulations for patients undergoing SLN mapping for breast cancer. Between Jan 13, 2006, and April 30, 2009, 140 patients with early breast cancer were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 fashion to receive the standard topical 4% lidocaine cream and injection of [(99m)Tc]Tc-sulfur colloid (n=35), or to one of three other study groups: topical placebo cream and injection of Tc-sulfur colloid containing either sodium bicarbonate (n=35), 1% lidocaine (n=35), or sodium bicarbonate and 1% lidocaine (n=35). The randomisation sequence was computer generated, and all patients and investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was patient-reported breast pain immediately after radioisotope injection, using the Wong-Baker FACES pain rating scale and McGill pain questionnaire, analysed in the per-protocol population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00940199. 19 of the 140 patients enrolled were excluded from analysis: nine declined study participation or sought care elsewhere, nine did not undergo SLN mapping because of disease extent or a technical problem, and one had unreliable data. There were no adverse events. Mean pain scores on the Wong-Baker scale (0-10) were: 6.0 (SD 2.6) for those who received standard of practice, 4.7 (3.0) for those who received radiocolloid plus bicarbonate, 1.6 (1.4) for those who received radiocolloid plus 1% lidocaine, and 1.6 (1.3) for those who received radiocolloid plus bicarbonate and 1% lidocaine (p<0.0001). Mean pain rating, according to the McGill questionnaire (0-78), was 17.5 (SD 11.8) for the standard-of-care group, 15.4 (14.4) for the sodium bicarbonate group, 4.6 (4.5) for the 1% lidocaine group, and 3.4 (5.1) for the sodium bicarbonate plus 1% lidocaine group (p<0.0001). SLN identification rates for each group were: 96% for the standard of care, 97% for sodium bicarbonate, 90% for 1% lidocaine, and 90% for sodium bicarbonate plus 1% lidocaine group (p=0.56).

Can physical activity help to maintain cognitive functioning and psychosocial well-being among breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy? A randomised controlled trial: study protocol.,"Gokal, Munir, Wallis, Ahmed, Boiangiu, Kancherla","Journal Article, Randomized Controlled Trial, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25903195/,Evidence suggests chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer is associated with side effects such as cognitive impairment. Cognitive impairments reported by patients have been associated with higher levels of emotional distress. We propose that physical activity could also help to alleviate cognitive impairments in women diagnosed with breast cancer.,"Evidence suggests chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer is associated with side effects such as cognitive impairment in domains of memory, attention, concentration and executive function. Cognitive impairments reported by patients have been associated with higher levels of emotional distress. To date, intervention studies to alleviate cognitive impairment associated with chemotherapy have focused on psycho-educational techniques or cognitive training. Studies have not yet considered physical activity as a potential for alleviating cognitive problems. Physical activity interventions are reported to be effective in alleviating emotional distress and fatigue in those with breast cancer. They have also been reported to improve cognitive functioning in the elderly, in those suffering with dementia and in children. We propose that physical activity could also help to alleviate cognitive impairments in women diagnosed with breast cancer. The study has been designed using a recently developed taxonomy of behaviour change techniques to reliably report the content of the intervention to allow future replication. This study will deliver a home-based moderate intensity walking intervention to women diagnosed with breast cancer mid-way through their chemotherapy treatment and will compare them to patients receiving usual care alone. The primary outcome measure for this intervention is changes in an objective measure of memory assessed using the Digit Span. Secondary outcome measures include: objective measures of executive function; attention; visual spatial skills; self report cognitive function; self-report fatigue; anxiety; depression; mood and self-esteem. As emotional distress has been associated with self-reporting of cognitive problems, this intervention will further test whether emotional distress mediates between the amount of walking undertaken during the intervention period and levels of self-reported cognitive functioning. The development of an effective intervention for preventing difficulties in emotional and cognitive functioning of cancer patients' post-treatment will help to guide health care professionals to improve patients' overall quality of life. It will also provide direction for future research, ultimately to improve the day to day functioning of breast cancer survivors. Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN50709297."
Cancer survival in adult patients in Spain.

Cancer cases from nine Spanish population-based cancer registries were included and analysed as a whole. All primary malignant neoplasms diagnosed in adult patients were eligible for the analysis. Cancer patients were followed until 31 December 2008. For each type of cancer, 1-, 3- and 5-year observed and relative survival were estimated by sex, age and years from diagnosis. Furthermore, age-standardized 5-year relative survival for the period 2000-2007 has been compared with that of the period 1995-1999. Skin melanoma (84.6 95% CI 83.0-86.2), prostate (84.6% 95% CI 83.6-85.6) and thyroid (84.2% CI 95% 82.0-86.6) cancers showed the highest 5-year relative survival, whereas the worst prognosis was observed in pancreatic (6% 95% CI 5.1-7.0) and oesophageal (9.4% 95% CI 7.9-11.1) cancers. Overall, survival is higher in women (58.0%) than in men (48.9%). The absolute difference in relative survival between 2000-2007 and 1995-1999 was positive for all cancers as a whole (+4.8% in men, +1.6% in women) and for most types of tumours. Survival increased significantly for chronic myeloid leukaemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and rectum cancer in both sexes, and for acute lymphoid leukaemia, prostate, liver and colon cancers in men and Hodgkin's lymphoma and breast cancer in women. Survival patterns by age were similar in Europe and Spain. A decline in survival by age was observed in all tumours, being more pronounced for ovarian, corpus uteri, prostate and urinary bladder and less for head and neck and rectum cancers. High variability and differences have been observed in survival among adults in Spain according to the type of cancer diagnosed, from above 84% to below 10%, reflecting high heterogeneity. The differences in prognosis by age, sex and period of diagnosis reveal opportunities for improving cancer care in Spain."

More recent research suggests effects may extend to other areas, including reports that cigarette smoking decreases breast milk production in mothers, byproducts of tobacco use are transmitted in breast milk, exposure to passive smoking may alter children's intelligence and behavior, and passive smoke exposure in childhood may be a risk factor for developing lung cancer as an adult. Primary prevention is the most effective strategy to decrease the prevalence of smoking. Those who never smoke never become addicted to nicotine and never have to quit. Secondary prevention must also be emphasized, because children whose parents smoke are exposed to health risks and are themselves more likely to smoke in the future. Parental health can be improved by smoking cessation. To accomplish the goals of primary and secondary prevention, the aggressive public health strategy directed at both parents and children should be expanded. This strategy requires the strong support of physicians, with emphasis on prevention in practice, support of public health initiatives, medical and public policy, and the conduct of high-quality research."

Two-stage diagnostic validation study in 10 general practices in eastern England. Method Participants aged 18-50 years were identified via random sampling from electronic searches of general practice records. Participants completed a FHQ then had a three-generational 'gold standard' pedigree taken, to determine disease risk category. In stage 1, the FHQ comprised 12 items; in stage 2 the shorter 6-item FHQ was validated against the same 'gold standard'. There were 1147 participants (stage 1: 618; stage 2: 529). Overall, 32% were at increased risk of one or more marker conditions (diabetes 18.9%, ischaemic heart disease 13.3%, breast cancer 6.2%, colorectal cancer 2.2%). The shorter 6-item FHQ performed very well for all four conditions: pooled data from both stages show diabetes, sensitivity = 98%, specificity = 94%; ischaemic heart disease, sensitivity = 93%, specificity = 81%; breast cancer, sensitivity = 81%, specificity = 83%; colorectal cancer, sensitivity = 96%, specificity = 88%, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.90 for males and 0.89 for females. This brief self-completed FHQ shows good diagnostic accuracy for identifying people at higher risk of four common chronic diseases. It could be used in routine primary care to identify patients who would be most likely to benefit from a more detailed pedigree and risk assessment, and consequent management strategies."

Interventions included introduction of the rotavirus vaccine, improved clinical case management and exclusive breastfeeding up to 6 months of age.","The Programme for the Awareness and Elimination of Diarrhoea (PAED) was a pilot comprehensive diarrhoea prevention and control programme aimed to reduce post-neonatal, all-cause under-five mortality by 15 % in Lusaka Province. Interventions included introduction of the rotavirus vaccine, improved clinical case management of diarrhoea, and a comprehensive community prevention and advocacy campaign on hand washing with soap, exclusive breastfeeding up to 6 months of age, and the use of ORS and Zinc. This study aimed to assess the impact of PAED on under-5 mortality. The study was a pre-post evaluation design. The Demographic and Health Survey style population-based two-stage approach was used to collect data at the beginning of the intervention and 3 years following the start of intervention implementation in Lusaka province. The primary outcome of interest was an all-cause, post-neonatal under-five mortality rate defined as the probability of dying after the 28th day and before the fifth birthday among children aged 1-59 months. The Kaplan-Meier time to event analysis was used to estimate the probability of death; multiplying this probability by 1000 to yield the post-neonatal mortality rate. Survival-time inverse probability weighting model was used to estimate Average Treatment Effect (ATE). The percentage of children under age 5 who had diarrhoea in the last 2 weeks preceding the survey declined from 15.8 % (95 % CI: 15.2 %, 16.4 %) in 2012 to 12.7 % (95 % CI: 12.3 %, 13.2 %) in 2015. Over the same period, mortality in post-neonatal children under 5 years of age declined by 34 %, from an estimated rate of 29 deaths per 1000 live births (95 % CI: (26, 32) death per 1000 live births) to 19 deaths per 1000 live births (95 % CI: (16, 21) death per 1000 live births). When every child in the population of children aged 1-59 months is exposed to the intervention, the average time-to-death was estimated to be about 8 months more than when no child is exposed (ATE = 7.9; 95 % CI: 4.4,11.5; P < 0.001). Well-packaged diarrhoea preventive and treatment interventions delivered at the clinic and community-level could potentially reduce probability of death among children aged 1-59 months."

In preparation for phase 3b prevention trials in P/BF women, we explored attitudes about using a vaginal ring or oral pills for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), perceptions of HIV risk during P/BF and key influences on future PrEP use. In 2018, we conducted 16 single-sex focus group discussions (FGDs) with community- and clinic-recruited HIV-uninfected women, currently or recently P/BF, aged 18 to 40, and men with (currently or recently) P/BF partners, aged 18+. Participants completed a behavioural questionnaire, viewed an educational video and handled prototype placebo products. FGDs were conducted in local languages and transcribed, coded and analysed, using a socio-ecological framework, for key influences on willingness to use products, HIV risk perceptions and opinions on product attributes. Of the 128 participants (65 women, 63 men) 75% lived with their partner and 84% had a child. Women reported the most important influencers when P/BF were partners, and all stated that health decisions when P/BF are typically made jointly (e.g. medication use; ante/postnatal and baby care). There was consensus that P/BF women are at high risk for HIV, primarily because of their partner's infidelities, and new prevention options were welcomed. Participants valued multiple options and stated that woman's personal preference would be key to product choice. Anticipated concerns about products included risk of miscarriage, impact on infant development, complications during delivery and adequate production or taste of breastmilk. Specific perceived disadvantages emerged for the ring (e.g. vaginal discomfort, difficulty inserting/removing) and for pills (e.g. nausea/vomiting) that may be exacerbated during pregnancy. Health care providers' (HCPs) knowledge and approval of product use during P/BF was needed to mitigate anticipated fears. Participants perceived pregnancy and breastfeeding as high HIV risk periods and valued new prevention options. HIV protection of the mother-child dyad, safety of the baby, and ultimately, health of the family were paramount. Endorsement by HCPs and support from partners were key to future product acceptance. Participants recommended involving partners and HCPs in sensitization efforts for future trials."

Patients 18 years of age or older undergoing surgery for spinal metastases originating from primary non-thyroid, non-renal cell, and non-hepatocellular tumors between January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2016 were included. The primary outcomes were estimated amount of intraoperative blood loss and complications attributable to PE, such as neurologic injury, wound infection, thrombosis, or dissection. The secondary outcomes included perioperative allogeneic blood transfusion, anesthesia time, hospitalization, postoperative complication within 30 days, reoperation, 90-day mortality, and 1-year mortality. In total, 495 patients were identified, of which 54 (11%) underwent PE. After propensity score matching on 21 variables, including primary tumor, number of spinal levels, and surgical treatment, 53 non-PE patients were matched to 53 PE patients. Matching was adequate measured by comparing the matched variables, testing the standardized mean differences (<0.25), and inspecting Kernel density plots. The degree of embolization was noted to be complete, until stasis, or successful in 43 (80%) patients. Intraoperative blood loss did not differ between both groups with a median blood loss in liters of 0.6 (IQR, 0.4-1.2) for non-PE patients and 0.9 (IQR, 0.6-1.2) for PE patients (p=.32). No complications occurred during embolization or the time between embolization and surgery. No differences were found in terms of the secondary outcomes. Our data suggest that, although no complications occurred and the embolization procedure can be considered safe, patients with non-hypervascular spinal metastases might not benefit from PE. A larger, prospective study could confirm or refute these study findings and aid in elucidating a subset of spinal metastases that might benefit from PE."

Prevalence of breast carcinoma is high in Egypt and the cases of breast cancer constitute 29% of cancer cases treated at the national cancer institute. Most of our studied sample has heard about breast cancer as a disease.,"Breast cancer is considered the leading cause of cancer death among females in economically developing countries. Prevalence of breast carcinoma is high in Egypt and the cases of breast cancer constitute 29% of cancer cases treated at the national cancer institute. This study aimed at exploring the level of knowledge of Egyptian females of breast cancer and its risk factors. An interview questionnaire with 22 questions about breast cancer was developed. This questionnaire was previously published as a part of the German multicentre DACH study). A total of 600 female subjects that attended primary health care centres were enrolled in our study. The majority were located in Cairo with the mean age of 40.5 +/- 11.0. Most of our studied sample (94%) has heard about breast cancer as a disease. TV and radio were the main sources of knowledge about the disease (60%). The level of knowledge about breast cancer was limited in 80% of the subjects. Younger age subjects had a higher level of knowledge about breast cancer compared to older subjects with no significant difference statistically. The grade of knowledge about breast cancer was higher among highly educated subjects compared to less educated subjects with significant difference statistically. The highest known risk factors of breast cancer were exposure to X ray (79.5%), hormonal therapy (75.7%) and previous breast cancer disease (70.8%). This study clearly illustrates the need for a health education program directed to Egyptian females to improve the knowledge of breast cancer."
Linking of primary care records to census data to study the association between socioeconomic status and cancer incidence in Southern Europe: a nation-wide ecological study.,"Garcia-Gil, Elorza, Banque, Comas-CufÃ­, Blanch, Ramos, MÃ©ndez-Boo, Hermosilla, Bolibar, Prieto-Alhambra",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25329578/,"Study used SIDIAP database and MEDEA index based on urban socioeconomic indicators in the Spanish census. Study outcomes were incident cervical, breast, colorectal, prostate, and lung cancer in 2009-2012. Deprivation is associated differently with the occurrence of various cancer types.","Area-based measures of economic deprivation are seldom applied to large medical records databases to establish population-scale associations between deprivation and disease. To study the association between deprivation and incidence of common cancer types in a Southern European region. Retrospective ecological study using the SIDIAP (Information System for the Development of Research in Primary Care) database of longitudinal electronic medical records for a representative population of Catalonia (Spain) and the MEDEA index based on urban socioeconomic indicators in the Spanish census. Study outcomes were incident cervical, breast, colorectal, prostate, and lung cancer in 2009-2012. The completeness of SIDIAP cancer recording was evaluated through linkage of a geographic data subset to a hospital cancer registry. Associations between MEDEA quintiles and cancer incidence was evaluated using zero-inflated Poisson regression adjusted for sex, age, smoking, alcoholism, obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. SIDIAP sensitivity was 63% to 92% for the five cancers studied. There was direct association between deprivation and lung, colorectal, and cervical cancer: incidence rate ratios (IRR) 1.82 [1.64-2.01], IRR 1.60 [1.34-1.90], IRR 1.22 [1.07-1.38], respectively, comparing the most deprived to most affluent areas. In wealthy areas, prostate and breast cancers were more common: IRR 0.92 [0.80-1.00], IRR 0.91 [0.78-1.06]. Adjustment for confounders attenuated the association with lung cancer risk (fully adjusted IRR 1.16 [1.08-1.25]), reversed the direction of the association with colorectal cancer (IRR 0.90 [0.84-0.95]), and did not modify the associations with cervical (IRR 1.27 [1.11-1.45]), prostate (0.74 [0.69-0.80]), and breast (0.76 [0.71-0.81]) cancer. Deprivation is associated differently with the occurrence of various cancer types. These results provide evidence that MEDEA is a useful, area-based deprivation index for analyses of the SIDIAP database. This information will be useful to improve screening programs, cancer prevention and management strategies, to reach patients more effectively, particularly in deprived urban areas."
Breast cancer risk after caloric restriction during the 1944-1945 Dutch famine.,"Elias, Peeters, Grobbee, van Noord","Historical Article, Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15069116/,"The 1944-1945 Dutch famine led to caloric restriction. Women who were severely exposed to the famine had a statistically significantly higher risk of breast cancer. This result is compatible with data from the few animal studies investigating effects of short-term, transient caloric restrictions.","Data from animal models suggest that caloric restriction may reduce the risk of breast cancer, although not all dietary regimens produce similar effects. We examined whether caloric restriction imposed as a consequence of the 1944-1945 Dutch famine reduced the risk of breast cancer in women participating in a Dutch breast cancer screening program. Between 1983 and 1986, approximately 15 000 women, aged 2 to 33 years during the 1944-1945 Dutch famine, responded to a questionnaire about their famine experience. A famine exposure score, graded as absent, moderate, or severe exposure, was derived from answers regarding hunger, cold, and weight loss. During follow-up until January 2000, 585 women with incident breast cancer were identified by the regional cancer registry. The relationship between famine exposure and breast cancer risk was assessed by weighted Cox regression models, in which person-years lived for the entire cohort was extrapolated from data from a random sample of 15% of the cohort. Women who were severely exposed to the famine had a statistically significantly higher risk of breast cancer (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.09 to 2.01) than women who were not exposed. Women who were moderately exposed to the famine had a 13% increased risk of breast cancer (HR = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.92 to 1.38; P(trend) = 0.016). The association between famine exposure and breast cancer risk was stronger for women who were exposed between the ages of 2 and 9 years (severely exposed versus unexposed: HR = 2.01, 95% CI = 0.92 to 4.41) than for women who were exposed at older ages. The risk of breast cancer was increased in women who were severely exposed to a short but severe famine decades earlier. This result is compatible with data from the few animal studies investigating effects of short-term, transient caloric restriction."
"Screening for Alcohol Use and Brief Counseling of Adults - 13 States and the District of Columbia, 2017.","McKnight-Eily, Okoro, Turay, Acero, Hungerford",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32163383/,"Binge drinking is a leading preventable public health problem.

From 2006 to 2010, binge drinking contributed to approximately 49,000 annual deaths resulting from acute conditions (e.g., injuries and violence) (1). Binge drinking also increases the risk for adverse health conditions, including some chronic diseases (e.g., breast cancer) and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (2). In 2004, 2013, and again in 2018, for all U.S. adults aged â‰¥18 years in primary care, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended alcohol screening and brief intervention (alcohol SBI) or counseling for persons whose screening indicated drinking in excess of recommended limits or in ways that increase risk for poor health outcomes (3-5). However, previous CDC surveillance data indicate that patients report rarely talking to their provider about alcohol use,<sup>â€ </sup> and alcohol SBI is traditionally delivered through conversation. CDC recently analyzed 2017 data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey's five-question module, which asked adults in 13 states<sup>Â§</sup> and the District of Columbia (DC) about the delivery of alcohol SBI during their most recent checkup in the past 2 years. Overall, 81.4% of adults (age-standardized estimate) reported being asked about alcohol use by a health professional in person or on a form during a checkup in the past 2 years, but only 37.8% reported being asked a question about binge-level alcohol consumption, which is included on USPSTF recommended instruments (3). Among module respondents who were asked about alcohol use at a checkup in the past 2 years and reported current binge drinking (past 30 days) at time of survey, only 41.7% were advised about the harms of drinking too much at a checkup in the past 2 years, and only 20.1% were advised to reduce or quit drinking at a checkup in the past 2 years. These findings suggest that missed opportunities remain for health care providers to intervene with patients who report binge drinking. Working to implement alcohol SBI at a systems level, including the provision of the new Healthcare Effectiveness Data Information Set (HEDIS) measure, Unhealthy Alcohol Use Screening and Follow-Up, can improve alcohol SBI's use and benefit in primary care."

Nevertheless, the future possibility of using tamoxifen as a chemopreventive agent against breast cancer is discussed, particularly in relation to women at increased risk due to familial clustering. Alcohol consumption by young women, and overweight among postmenopausal women may also increase the incidence of breast cancer. Consequently, reduced alcohol intake by young women, and weight reduction among overweight women after menopause may reduce the risk of breast cancer."

One hundred hormone-insensitive breast cancer participants (aged 18-40 years) were recruited from two university-affiliated oncology centers in Egypt. Opting for type of cotreatment was based on available timeframe until start of chemotherapy. Fifty women ready for early chemotherapy were randomized to receive either chemotherapy alone (arm I) or chemotherapy after downregulation (estradiol less than 50 pg/mL) by GnRH antagonist and agonist (arm II). Then, GnRH antagonist was discontinued and agonist was continued until the end of chemotherapy. When chemotherapy was to start later than 10 days after study inclusion, 50 women were randomized to receive either chemotherapy alone (arm III) or chemotherapy after downregulation with GnRH agonist (arm IV). Resumption of menstruation at 12 months after end of chemotherapy was the primary outcome. Postchemotherapy hormonal and ultrasound changes were secondary outcomes. Twelve months after termination of chemotherapy, there were no differences in menstruation resumption rates between GnRH-treated patients and control group individuals in either early (80% in arms I and II, risk ratio 1, 95% confidence interval 0.7-.32; P=1.00) or delayed chemotherapy groups (80% and 84% in arms III and IV, risk ratio 0.95, 95% confidence interval 0.73-1.235; P=.71). There were no differences in hormonal and ultrasound markers between GnRH analogue users and control group individuals.

The IE intervention is grounded in social cognitive theory and integrates evidence-based techniques from cognitive behavioral couple therapy and sex therapy to address survivors' sexual concerns and enhance their and their partners' sexual, relationship, and psychological outcomes. This trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy of the IE intervention in improving survivors' sexual function, the primary study outcome. Secondary outcomes include survivors' sexual distress, partners' sexual function, and survivors' and partners' relationship intimacy and quality as well as psychological distress (depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms). Additional aims are to examine whether treatment effects on patient sexual function are mediated by sexual communication and self-efficacy for coping with sexual concerns and to explore whether survivor age and race/ethnicity moderate intervention effects on survivors' sexual function. Eligible adult female breast cancer survivors reporting sexual concerns and their intimate partners are recruited from two academic sites in the USA and are randomized to either the IE intervention or to a control condition of equal length offering education and support around breast cancer-related health topics (Living Healthy Together). The target sample size is 120 couples. Self-report outcome measures are administered to participants in both conditions at baseline (T1), post-treatment (T2), 3 months post-treatment (T3), and 6 months post-treatment (T4).

However, less is known about the possible familial associations of melanoma with other discordant cancers. A risk for discordant cancer may provide useful information about shared genetic and environmental risk factors and it may be relevant background data in clinical genetic counseling. Using the Swedish Family-Cancer Database, we assessed the relative risk (RR) for any cancer in families with increasing numbers of first-degree relatives diagnosed with melanoma, including multiple melanoma, and in reverse order RR for melanoma in families of multiple discordant cancers. Close to 9% of melanoma was familial; among these 92% were in 2-case families and 8% in families with 3 cases or more. Cancers that were associated with melanoma, in at least two independent analyses, included breast, prostate, colorectal, skin and nervous system cancers. Other associations included cancer of unknown primary, acute myeloid leukemia/myelofibrosis and WaldenstrÃ¶m macroglobulinemia/myeloma. Significant results, which appear biologically plausible, were also obtained for rare nasal melanoma and mesothelioma. Although small samples sizes and multiple comparisons were of concern, many of the above associations were internally consistent and provide new diverse leads for discordant familial association of melanoma."

GnRH-analogues and oral contraceptives for fertility preservation in women during chemotherapy.,"Blumenfeld, von Wolff","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18824495/,"Non-invasive techniques have attempted to minimize the gonadotoxic effect of chemotherapy. GnRH-a and oral contraceptives have no serious side effects and can even reduce chemotherapy-induced complications, such as severe menometrorrhagia.","For preserving fertility in women during chemotherapy, the character of invasive techniques, such as ovarian cryopreservation and other techniques, await further experience. Meanwhile, non-invasive techniques have attempted to minimize the gonadotoxic effect of chemotherapy, by using gonadotrophin-releasing hormone-analogues (GnRH-a) or oral contraceptives (OC). We performed a computerized MEDLINE search to identify articles published on fertility preservation using GnRH-a or OCs. Nine human-controlled studies reported the use of GnRH-a and four reported the use of OCs in parallel to chemotherapy. All nine studies analysing the effect of GnRH-a found lower rates of premature ovarian failure (POF) in patients receiving GnRH-a compared with the controls. Summarizing the studies resulted in 11.1% incidence of POF in patients who received GnRH-a compared with 55.5% incidence in the controls. Evidence using the fertility preserving effect of OC is limited. Two studies showed lower POF rates in OC-treated patients. The summarized data revealed a POF rate of 13.2% in patients who received OCs compared with that of 29.8% in the controls. The published clinical studies provide evidence, but do not prove statistically, that GnRH-a co-treatment reduces gonadotoxicity. Owing to the retrospective and non-randomized nature of most of the studies, definite conclusions concerning the reduction of POF by GnRH-a can still not be unequivocally drawn. As GnRH-a and OC have no serious side effects and as GnRH-a can even reduce chemotherapy-induced complications, such as severe menometrorrhagia, GnRH-a are considered by many clinicians as a clinically useful co-treatment in chemotherapy. The published clinical studies on OC also suggest a possible effect on the reduction of POF under certain conditions."

We asked questions pertaining to personal and societal breast cancer risk and hypothetical questions regarding preventive surgery if the respondent or a family member were in the same position as Ms Jolie. Demographic information was collected, as was family risk for breast and ovarian cancer, and a gauge of numeracy. While three of four Americans were aware of Angelina Jolie's double mastectomy, fewer than 10% of respondents had the information necessary to accurately interpret Ms Jolie's risk of developing cancer relative to a woman unaffected by the BRCA gene mutation. Awareness of the Angelina Jolie story was not associated with improved understanding. While celebrities can bring heightened awareness to health issues, there is a need for these messages to be accompanied by more purposeful communication efforts to assist the public in understanding and using the complex diagnostic and treatment information that these stories convey."

Our aim was to provide simple summary measures of changes in cancer mortality and incidence in Australia so that progress and areas for improvement in cancer control can be identified. We used national data on cancer deaths and newly registered cancer cases and compared expected and observed numbers of deaths and cases diagnosed in 2007. The expected numbers were obtained by applying 1987 age-sex specific rates (average of 1986-1988) directly to the 2007 population. The observed numbers of deaths and incident cases were calculated for 2007 (average of 2006-2008). We limited the analyses to people aged less than 75 years. There was a 28% fall in cancer mortality (7827 fewer deaths in 2007 vs. 1987) and a 21% increase in new cancer diagnoses (13,012 more diagnosed cases in 2007). The greatest reductions in deaths were for cancers of the lung in males (-2259), bowel (-1797), breast (-773) and stomach (-577). Other notable falls were for cancers of the prostate (-295), cervix (-242) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (-240). Only small or no changes occurred in mortality for cancers of the lung (female only), pancreas, brain and related, oesophagus and thyroid, with an increase in liver cancer (267). Cancer types that showed the greatest increase in incident cases were cancers of the prostate (10,245), breast (2736), other cancers (1353), melanoma (1138) and thyroid (1107), while falls were seen for cancers of the lung (-1705), bladder (-1110) and unknown primary (-904). The reduction in mortality indicates that prevention strategies, improvements in cancer treatment, and screening programmes have made significant contributions to cancer control in Australia since 1987. The rise in incidence is partly due to diagnoses being brought forward by technological improvements and increased coverage of screening and early diagnostic testing."
Assessment of the role of ageing and non-ageing factors in death from non-communicable diseases based on a cumulative frequency model.,Hui,Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28811618/,"A characterization of the effects of ageing, genetic, and exogenous variables on 12 major non-communicable diseases was evaluated. Results showed that ageing plays an important role in death from chronic disease. Exogenous factors may contribute more to the pattern of chronic disease than genetic factors.","To quantify the effects of ageing and non-ageing factors, a characterization of the effects of ageing, genetic, and exogenous variables on 12 major non-communicable diseases was evaluated using a model assessing cumulative frequency of death and survival by age group from dead and surviving populations based on mortality statistics. Indices (0-1) of the roles of ageing (ARD), genetics (GRD) and exogenous (ERD) variables in deaths due to disease were established, and the sum of ARD, GRD and ERD was 1 (value of each indices was <1). Results showed that ageing plays an important role in death from chronic disease; exogenous factors may contribute more to the pattern of chronic disease than genetic factors (ARD, GRC and ERD were 0.818, 0.058 and 0.124 respectively for all non-communicable diseases). In descending order, ERD for non-communicable diseases were breast cancer, leukaemia, cancer of the cervix uteri and uterus, liver cancer, nephritis and nephropathy, stomach cancer, lung cancer, diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, coronary heart disease, COPD, and Alzheimer's disease, while a smaller ERD indicated a tendency of natural death. An understanding of the aforementioned complex relationships of specific non-communicable diseases will be beneficial in designing primary prevention measures for non-communicable diseases in China."

It is currently estimated that there will be at least 170-190 new cancer cases annually for each 100 000 people. The most frequent and primary cancers are cervix, breast, lymph node, skin and nasopharynx.","Cancer control has been in effect in Indonesia since the early 1920s. It was the Dutch Colonial Government who started with the Institution for Cancer Control, which was closed by the Japanese Occupation Administration between 1942 and 1945. After the independence of the Republic of Indonesia, a Cancer Control Foundation was established in 1962. At present, clinical and non-clinical departments in government teaching hospitals (there are 13 teaching hospitals) usually handle all cancer problems. In 1993, Dharmais Cancer Center in Jakarta was established and has become the top referral cancer hospital for Indonesia. Until now, there have been no nationwide accurate data on cancer registration, owing to a lack of funds and manpower. Cancer data collection is usually provided as a relative frequency study from several departments of the teaching hospitals. It is currently estimated that there will be at least 170-190 new cancer cases annually for each 100 000 people. The most frequent and primary cancers are cervix, breast, lymph node, skin and nasopharynx. Since Indonesia is now in a transition phase and has many problems concerning the economy and health care, we suggested a well-planned cancer control program. It includes the primary, secondary and tertiary prevention of cancer in cities, where inhabitants can afford to subsidize a certain proportion of the budgets for the implementation of this program."
The epidemiology of ovarian cancer.,"Greene, Clark, Blayney","Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6091274/,"No unequivocally effective ovarian cancer prevention strategies have emerged. Pregnancy, especially pregnancy before age 25 years, and use of oral contraceptives are protective. Survivors of ovarian cancer are more susceptible to cancers of the breast, endometrium, and colon than are similarly-aged normal women.","Although no unequivocally effective ovarian cancer prevention strategies have emerged, epidemiologic studies have identified high-risk populations. The striking international variation (apparently a fivefold difference) can probably be explained on the basis of differential parity, differing classification measures, and differences in the underlying population age distribution. United States age-adjusted mortality has increased slightly in the past 30 years, and the cancer remains predominantly a disease of older adult white women of northern European extraction. The increases in age-specific mortality and age-adjusted mortality over time may be related to a decrease in average family size. Pregnancy, especially pregnancy before age 25 years, and use of oral contraceptives are protective; the risk of ovarian cancer increases with increasing years of ovulation. A positive family history is also associated with a substantial increase in ovarian cancer risk. Survivors of ovarian cancer are more susceptible to cancers of the breast, endometrium, and colon than are similarly-aged normal women, most probably because all four cancers share some common risk factor(s). Various alkylating agents are clearly leukemogenic in survivors of ovarian cancer, an observation that suggests caution in the use of adjuvant chemotherapy in women at relatively low risk of relapse."

This study presents formative research from a long-term project examining the potential of mother-daughter communication in promoting cancer screening among African American women. Thirty-two mother-daughter pairs (N = 64) completed orally administered surveys regarding their cancer knowledge, beliefs and attitudes, and barriers to care. This study compares the attitudes and beliefs of low-income, urban, African American mothers and their adolescent daughters regarding cervical and breast cancer screening. Both mothers and daughters had fairly high levels of knowledge about breast and cervical cancer. In addition, there was a high concordance rate between mothers' and daughters' responses, suggesting a potential sharing of health knowledge between mother and daughter. These results have implications for selecting communication strategies to reduce health disparities, and support that the mother-daughter dyad could be a viable unit to disseminate targeted screening information.

The Ductal Lavage (DL) procedure offers a minimally invasive method to obtain breast epithelial cells from the ductal system for cytopathologic analysis. Several studies with long-term follow-up have shown that women with atypical hyperplasia have an elevated risk of developing breast cancer. The objective of the proposed trial is to assess the efficacy and safety of a daily administration of nimesulide or simvastatin in women at higher risk for breast cancer, focused particularly on hormone non-responsive tumor risk. The primary endpoint is the change in prevalence of atypical cells and cell proliferation (measured by Ki67) in DL or fine needle aspirate samples, after 12 months of treatment and 12 months after treatment cessation. METHODS-DESIGN: From 2005 to 2011, 150 women with a history of estrogen receptor negative ductal intraepithelial neoplasia or lobular intraepithelial neoplasia or atypical hyperplasia, or unaffected subjects carrying a mutation of BRCA1 or with a probability of mutation >10% (according to BRCAPRO) were randomized to receive nimesulide 100mg/day versus simvastatin 20mg/day versus placebo for one year followed by a second year of follow-up. This is the first randomized placebo controlled trial to evaluate the role of DL to study surrogate endpoints biomarkers and the effects of these drugs on breast carcinogenesis. In 2007 the European Medicines Agency limited the use of systemic formulations of nimesulide to 15 days. According to the European Institute of Oncology Ethics Committee communication, we are now performing an even more careful monitoring of the study participants. Preliminary results showed that DL is a feasible procedure, the treatment is well tolerated and the safety blood tests do not show any significant liver toxicity. There is an urgent need to confirm in the clinical setting the potential efficacy of other compounds in contrasting hormone non-responsive breast cancer. This paper is focused on the methodology and operational aspects of the clinical trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01500577)."

The mean age (SD) of participants was 31.6 (+/- 8.5) years with a range of 18 to 62 years. After control for level of education, age was not found to be a statistically significant factor that influenced participants' performance. Also not statistically significant was the history of having a relative who had cancer. Conversely, education was the only examined factor that correlated with interviewees' awareness and attitude. Individuals with university or higher education (level III) were more knowledgeable (statistically significant) than uneducated or those with only primary schooling (level I), or those participants who only had intermediate or high school education (level II). On the other hand, the responses of those individuals with education level I generally performed in a fashion similar to those at education level II. The general outcome of this exercise was that unacceptably high proportions of females at all education levels were either wrong or uncertain about some fundamental aspects of breast cancer etiology, risk factors, clinical features, detection methods, and management. Also shown was the relatively high percentages of those, particularly in education level I, who held misconceptions about unconventional management or the complications of conventional methods. We conclude that academic education alone is not enough to assure that recommended health behaviors will be adopted. For establishing cancer health education or cancer prevention and early detection programs, primary care physicians and community cancer centers should work jointly. Brief guidelines are proposed."

Anovulatory cycles were associated with later age at menarche, fewer elapsed years since menarche and greater levels of energy expended per week in physical activity. After adjusting for age at menarche and years since menarche, there was a significant dose-related trend in the risk of anovular menstrual cycles associated with increasing levels of physical activity (1-sided P = 0.03). Major determinants of average cycle length were weekly average energy expenditure (less than or equal to 750 kcal wk-1 associated with cycles that were on average 2.4 days longer), age at menarche (an increase of 0.7 days per year of age) and race (Asians having cycles about 1.9 days longer than Caucasians). Because a major determinant of breast cancer risk may be the cumulative number of ovulatory cycles, these data suggest that regular participation in moderate physical activity, by reducing the frequency of ovulatory cycles in adolescence, may provide an opportunity for the primary prevention of breast cancer."

The aim of this study is to update the mortality and hospitalization analyses concerning the 6,227,531 inhabitants (10.4% of the Italian population) residing in 46 contaminated sites (39 of national interest and 7 of regional interest). The sites include 316 municipalities distributed as follows: 15 in the North-East (20.3% of the investigated population); 104 in the North-West (12% of the investigated population), 32 in the Centre (12.6% of the investigated population), 165 in the South and Islands (55.5% of the investigated population). Analyses were carried out on the paediatric-adolescent (1,128,396 residents) and youth (665,284 residents) population, and a study on congenital anomalies (CA) was carried out at sites covered by congenital malformation registers. Accompanying the epidemiological assessments, site-specific socioeconomic conditions were examined and an overall estimate of excess risk for populations residing at contaminated sites was drawn up. By means of a systematic review of the scientific literature, the epidemiological evidence on causal links between sources of environmental exposure and health effects was updated to identify pathologies of a priori interest. In the 46 sites included in the SENTIERI Project, mortality (time window: 2013-2017) and hospital admissions (time window: 2014-2018) of the general population of all ages, divided by gender, and of the paediatric-adolescent (0-1 year, 0-14 years, 0-19 years), youth (20-29 years), and overall (0-29 years) age groups, divided by gender, were analysed. In 21 sites, CA diagnosed within the first year of life were studied. Standardised mortality ratios (SMR) and hospitalization ratios (SHR) were calculated with reference to the rates in the regions to which the sites belong. The reference population was calculated net of residents in the sites. CA were studied by calculating the prevalence per 10,000 births and the ratio, multiplied by 100, between the cases observed at the site and those expected on the basis of the prevalences observed in the reference area (region or sub-regional area of belonging, according to the geographical coverage of the registry). The socioeconomic condition studied in the 46 sites is based on the convergence of three deprivation indicators with respect to the reference region: deprivation index at municipal level, deprivation index at census section level, premature mortality indicator (age range 30-69 years) for chronic non-communicable diseases. For the estimation of excess risk for the entire study population, meta-analysis of the mortality and hospitalization risk estimates for each site was carried out and the number of excess deaths estimated for the sites as a whole. The epidemiological evidence was updated through a systematic literature review (January 2009-May 2020), following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. The search was carried out on the search engines MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science; the quality of the studies included in the review was assessed using the AMSTAR 2 checklist for systematic reviews and the NewCastle-Ottawa"

Methods: in this retrospective study, all patients diagnosed with primary cancers and registered with the KPBCR were included. New cancer cases registered from 2014 were identified from pathological labs, medical reports of 48 health facilities providing cancer diagnosis or treatment services and the national death registry program. Data for patients who were referred to neighboring provinces to access health services were also collected from national referral registries. Results from autopsies was additionally extracted from regional forensic and legal medicine centers and added to the registry periodically. Age standardized incidence rates (ASRs) per 100,000 person-years for all cancers were computed, using direct-standardization and CanReg methodology. Mortality to incidence (M:I) ratios and microscopically verified (MV) proportions were calculated as quality measures. Results: A total of 2,838 cases of cancer were registered in Kerman province, 2014. Of these 45. 6% involved women (n=1,293).

The knowledge and willingness of parents toward the HPV vaccine are crucial to increasing the uptake of the vaccine.,"Cervical cancer is currently the second-leading cause of cancer death among women in Ethiopia. Vaccination against the human papillomavirus (HPV) is an effective primary prevention strategy for HPV-related illnesses. The knowledge and willingness of parents toward the HPV vaccine are crucial to increasing the uptake of the vaccine. The vaccine's acceptance by children and young adolescents is dependent on parental consent. Therefore, this study aimed to assess knowledge, willingness, and associated factors of the human papillomavirus vaccine among parents of girls aged 9-14 years at Debre Tabor Town. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among participants from December 10, 2020, to January 15, 2021. A simple random sample technique was used to include 638 participants. A structured face-to-face interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. The data were entered and analyzed using Epi-Data and SPSS software, respectively. Bivariate and multivariable analyses were used to examine the association. The Odds Ratio (OR), 95% CI, and p-values less than 0.05 were used to determine the statistical association. Thirty-five percent (35.4%, 95% CI = 31.4%, 38.8%) and 44.8% (95% CI = 40.40%, 48.67%) of participants were knowledgeable about HPV vaccination and willing to get it, respectively. Being government employees (AOR = 5.46, 95% CI = 2.42, 9.34), and having a family history of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) (AOR = 1.76, 95% CI = 1.14, 2.72) were significantly associated with knowledge of the human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine. Participants' age (AOR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.16, 2.87), secondary education and above (AOR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.05, 2.74), fear of HPV infection (AOR = 2.29, 95% CI = 1.21, 4.32), and having good knowledge of the HPV vaccine (AOR = 3.30, 95% CI = 2.21, 4.93) were significantly associated with willingness to receive the HPV vaccine. The knowledge and willingness of parents toward the HPV vaccine were low. Then, health officials should boost HPV vaccination promotion through public media. In schools, churches, mosques, and health facilities, health extension workers and health professionals provide information about the HPV vaccine for the parents. Mixed quantitative and qualitative studies are preferable for future research to address ""why"" issues."

Data from the New Haven Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA) study were linked to the Connecticut Tumor Registry (CTR). The sample comprised of seventy-two women with a first primary breast cancer diagnosed sometime after their baseline ECA study interview. In the ECA study, lifetime psychiatric history was assessed using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule based on DSM-III criteria. Stage at diagnosis of breast cancer was taken from CTR records and dichotomized into early stage (in situ and localized tumors) versus late stage (regional and distant tumors). A positive history of major depression was associated with an increased likelihood of late-stage diagnosis of breast cancer (odds ratio [OR] = 9.81, p = 0.039), whereas a positive history of phobic disorders was associated with a decreased likelihood of late-stage diagnosis (OR = 0.01, p = 0.021), controlling for sociodemographic characteristics of the sample. These analyses revealed a longitudinal association between reported lifetime psychiatric history and stage at diagnosis of subsequent breast cancer. Phobia may motivate women to adhere to breast cancer screening recommendations and to report suspicious symptoms to a physician without delay. Major depression, on the other hand, was identified as an important predictor of late-stage diagnosis; proper recognition and management of depression in the primary care setting may have important implications for breast cancer detection and survival."

Antibody transfer ratios (cord blood/maternal sera at delivery) and serotype-specific secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) and IgG in breast milk after delivery and on postpartum days 42 and 90 were evaluated. The planned sample size was not based on statistical assumptions for this descriptive study. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. Serious adverse events were reported for 16% of GBS-vaccinated women and 15% of their infants, and 15% of placebo recipients and 12% of their infants; none were fatal or deemed vaccine-related. Serotype-specific IgG geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) were 13-23-fold higher in vaccine vs placebo recipients on day 31 and persisted until postpartum day 90. Median antibody concentrations were substantially higher in women with detectable pre-vaccination antibody concentrations. Antibody transfer ratios in the vaccine group were 0.62-0.82. Infant IgG GMCs and breast milk sIgA GMCs were higher in the vaccine vs the placebo group at all timepoints. Maternal immunization with the trivalent GBS vaccine in US women had a favorable safety profile, elicited antibodies that were transplacentally transferred and persisted in infants for a minimum of 3 months.

Observed and expected numbers of cancers among oral cleft cases were summarized as the overall and as 52 site-specific standardized incidence ratios. The expected overall number of all cancers was 131, but 140 incident cancers were found, corresponding to a standardized incidence ratio of 1.07 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.90, 1.26). Analyses of the 52 sites for all oral cleft cases and analyses stratified for three cleft subgroups and the two sexes revealed only a few significant associations: an increased occurrence of breast cancer among females born with cleft lip and/or cleft palate (standardized incidence ratio (SIR) = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.05, 2.14), primary brain cancer among females born with cleft palate (SIR = 3.11, 95% CI: 1.14, 6.78), and primary lung cancer among males born with both cleft lip and cleft palate (SIR = 2.49, 95% CI: 1.00, 5.14). The results do not provide evidence for an increased overall cancer risk for individuals born with oral clefts."
Disability adjusted life years for cancer patients in India.,"Murthy, Nandakumar, Pruthvish, George, Mathew",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21039029/,"The disability adjusted life year (DALY) has been employed to quantify the burden of diseases.

According to the present estimates, the YLL component of DALy is about 70.0%.","The disability adjusted life year (DALY) has been employed to quantify the burden of diseases. This measure allows for combining in a single indicator ""years of life lived with disabilities (YLD)"" and ""years of life lost from premature death (YLL)"" . The present communication attempts to estimate the burden of cancers in-terms of YLL, YLD and DALY for ""all sites"" and leading sites of cancer in India for the years 2001, 2006, 2011 and 2016. The YLL, YLD and DALY were estimated by employing Global Burden of Disease (GBD) methodology using the DISMOD procedure. The published data on age, gender and site specific cancer incidence and mortality for the years 2001-2003 relating to six population-based cancer registries viz. Bangalore, Barshi, Bhopal, Chennai, Delhi and Mumbai, expectation of life by gender for urban areas of the country for 1999-2003 and the projected population during years 2001, 2006, 2011 and 2016 were utilized for the computations. DALYs were found to be lower for males (2,038,553, 2,313,843, 2,656,693 and 3,021,708 for 2001, 2006, 2011 and 2016 respectively) as compared to females (2,560,423, 2,961,218, 3,403,176 and 3,882,649). Amongst males, highest DALYs were contributed by cancer of the lung and esophagus while in females they were for cancers of breast and cervix uteri. It is estimated that total DALYs due to cancer in India combined for both genders would increase from 4,598,976 in 2001 to 6,904,358 by 2016. Premature mortality is a major contributor to disease burden. According to the present estimates, the YLL component of DALY is about 70.0%. The above described computations reveal an urgent need for initiating primary and secondary prevention measures for control of cancers."
Battering during pregnancy: tip of an iceberg revealed.,McFarlane,"Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2815791/,"Battering occurs during pregnancy with women reporting blows to the pregnant abdomen, injuries to the breast and genitals, and sexual assault. A community-wide primary prevention program is presented that has linked the health care provider with law enforcement.","Physical abuse of women is pervasive with one in three women experiencing battering. Battering occurs during pregnancy with women reporting blows to the pregnant abdomen, injuries to the breast and genitals, and sexual assault. A recent study in a large metropolitan area documented one in twelve pregnant women to have been physically battered during the present pregnancy. Among the women battered, 87% had been physically abused prior to pregnancy and 29% reported the abuse increased after becoming pregnant. Health care providers did not assess any of the women for abuse. When pregnancy outcome was analyzed in another study of 589 postpartum women, battered women were four times more likely to deliver a low-birthweight infant. This paper discusses the etiology of battering, prevalence of battering during pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes of battered women. A community-wide primary prevention program is presented that has linked the health care provider with law enforcement and shelters for battered women to interrupt the cycle of violence and promote the health and safety of pregnant women."
Validity and usefulness of a single-item measure of patient-reported bother from side effects of cancer therapy.,"Pearman, Beaumont, Mroczek, O'Connor, Cella","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29131323/,"The improving efficacy of cancer treatment has resulted in an increasing array of treatment-related symptoms.

Often, clinical trials compare therapies that have different types, and severities, of adverse effects. Whether rated by clinicians or patients themselves, it can be difficult to know which side effect profile is more disruptive or bothersome to patients. A simple summary index of bother can help to adjudicate the variability in adverse effects across treatments being compared with each other. Across 4 studies, a total of 5765 patients enrolled in cooperative group studies and industry-sponsored clinical trials were the subjects of the current study. Patients were diagnosed with a range of primary cancer sites, including bladder, brain, breast, colon/rectum, head/neck, hepatobiliary, kidney, lung, ovary, pancreas, and prostate as well as leukemia and lymphoma. All patients were administered the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General version (FACT-G). The single item ""I am bothered by side effects of treatment"" (GP5), rated on a 5-point Likert scale, is part of the FACT-G. To determine its validity as a useful summary measure from the patient perspective, it was correlated with individual and aggregated clinician-rated adverse events and patient reports of their general ability to enjoy life. Analyses of pharmaceutical trials demonstrated that mean GP5 scores (""I am bothered by side effects of treatment"") significantly differed by maximum adverse event grade (P<.001) in all trials, with a clear trend toward increasing GP5 scores with level of increasing adverse event grade. Effect sizes ranged from 0.13 to 0.46. Analyses of cooperative group trials demonstrated a significant correlation between GP5 and item GF3 (""I am able to enjoy life"") in the predicted direction. The single FACT-G item ""I am bothered by side effects of treatment"" is significantly associated with clinician-reported adverse events and with patients' ability to enjoy their lives. It has promise as an overall summary measure of the burden of a given set of treatment toxicities compared with another. Future research can identify the contribution of individual side effects compared with one another in terms of how each may contribute to overall bother. Cancer 2018;124:991-7.

Effectiveness of evidence-based decision aids for women with pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCA2 variants in the german health care context: results from a randomized controlled trial.,"Kautz-Freimuth, RedaÃ¨lli, Shukri, Kentenich, Simic, Mildenberger, Schmutzler, Rhiem, Stock","Randomized Controlled Trial, Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37845719/,Women with pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCa2 variants are at high risk for breast and ovarian cancer. Two evidence-based decision aids have recently been developed for these women. This study evaluated their effectiveness.,"Women with pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCA2 variants are at high risk for breast and ovarian cancer. Preventive options include risk-reducing breast and ovarian surgeries and intensified breast surveillance. However, individual decision-making is often associated with decisional conflicts. Two evidence-based decision aids have recently been developed for these women (healthy or with unilateral breast cancer) for the German context to support them in their decision-making process. This study evaluated their effectiveness. In a randomized controlled study, women (aged 18-70 years) with pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCA2 variants were randomly assigned 1:1 to the intervention (IG, n = 230) or control (CG, n = 220) group. All participants received usual care. After baseline survey (t0), IG participants additionally received the DAs. Follow-up surveys were at three (t1) and six (t2) months. Primary outcome was decisional conflict at t1. Secondary analyses included decision status, decision regret, knowledge on risks and preventive options, self-reported psychological symptoms, acceptability of DAs, and preparation for decision-making. Of 450 women recruited, 417 completed t0, 398 completed t1 and 386 completed t2. Compared to CG, IG participants had lower decisional conflict scores at t1 (p = 0.049) and t2 (p = 0.006) and higher scores for knowledge (p = 0.004), acceptability (p = 0.000), and preparation for decision-making (p < 0.01). These DAs can help improve key parameters of decision-making in women with pathogenic BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants and, thus, provide a useful add-on to the current counseling and care concept for these women in Germany.

Enhancing patient outcomes in aesthetic and reconstructive breast surgery using triple antibiotic breast irrigation: six-year prospective clinical study.,"Adams, Rios, Smith",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16404244/,Capsular contracture remains one of the most commonly reported complications in aesthetic and reconstructive breast patients. Triple antibiotic breast irrigation is clinically associated with a low incidence of capsularcontracture compared with other published reports. Application of triple antibiotic irrigation is recommended for all aesthetic and reconstructed breast procedures.,"Capsular contracture remains one of the most commonly reported complications in aesthetic and reconstructive breast patients. Previous in vitro studies from the authors' laboratory have recommended a new triple antibiotic povidone-iodine irrigation (2000) and subsequently a triple antibiotic non-povidone-iodine-containing irrigant (2001) to optimize broad-spectrum coverage of various bacteria implicated in capsular contracture; however, the clinical efficacy of these in vitro studies remains unproven. The purpose of this study was to determine the clinical efficacy for the previously reported triple antibiotic breast irrigation. The cost-effectiveness of universal application of irrigation solutions in breast prosthesis surgery was analyzed as well. Patients undergoing aesthetic and reconstructive breast implant procedures were treated with a standardized operative technique, including the use of triple antibiotic breast irrigation by a single surgeon. Capsular contracture was assessed using a simplified Baker scale and graded by two independent caregivers to maximize objectivity and consistency. Additional complications were also recorded, including reoperation. Patient charges for antibiotic irrigation and reoperation for contracture were determined and compared. A total of 335 patients operated on since 1997 were evaluated prospectively. They ranged in age from 18 to 86 years, and the mean follow-up was 14 months (range, 6 to 75 months). The rate of grade III/IV capsular contracture in the study groups was 1.8 percent for patients undergoing primary breast augmentation. Patients undergoing augmentation-mastopexy had a grade III/IV contracture rate of 0 percent. Breast reconstruction patients had a 9.5 percent rate of grade III/IV contracture. Triple antibiotic breast irrigation is clinically associated with a low incidence of capsular contracture compared with other published reports, and its clinical efficacy supports previously published in vitro studies. Application of triple antibiotic irrigation is recommended for all aesthetic and reconstructive breast procedures and is cost effective."

The main benefit is the offer of NICE-approved more frequent screening and/ or chemoprevention for women who are at increased risk, but are unaware of this. We have developed BC-Predict, to be offered to women when invited to NHSBSP which collects information on risk factors (self-reported information on family history and hormone-related factors via questionnaire; mammographic density; and in a sub-sample, Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms). BC-Predict produces risk feedback letters, inviting women at high risk (â‰¥8% 10-year) or moderate risk (â‰¥5 to < 8% 10-year) to have discussion of prevention and early detection options at Family History, Risk and Prevention Clinics. Despite the promise of systems such as BC-Predict, there are still too many uncertainties for a fully-powered definitive trial to be appropriate or ethical. The present research aims to identify these key uncertainties regarding the feasibility of integrating BC-Predict into the NHSBSP. Key objectives of the present research are to quantify important potential benefits and harms, and identify key drivers of the relative cost-effectiveness of embedding BC-Predict into NHSBSP. A non-randomised fully counterbalanced study design will be used, to include approximately equal numbers of women offered NHSBSP (n = 18,700) and BC-Predict (n = 18,700) from selected screening sites (n = 7). In the initial 8-month time period, women eligible for NHSBSP will be offered BC-Predict in four screening sites. Three screening sites will offer women usual NHSBSP. In the following 8-months the study sites offering usual NHSBSP switch to BC-Predict and vice versa. Key potential benefits including uptake of risk consultations, chemoprevention and additional screening will be obtained for both groups. Key potential harms such as increased anxiety will be obtained via self-report questionnaires, with embedded qualitative process analysis. A decision-analytic model-based cost-effectiveness analysis will identify the key uncertainties underpinning the relative cost-effectiveness of embedding BC-Predict into NHSBSP. We will assess the feasibility of integrating BC-Predict into the NHSBSP, and identify the main uncertainties for a definitive evaluation of the clinical and cost-effectiveness of BC-Predict.

The questionnaires, prepared in English and vernacular, were given to women and women relations seen in the surgical clinics and wards of Ladoke Akintola University Teaching Hospital, Osogbo and some primary health centers, for various ailments. Traders in market places and rural communities were included. Analysis was by SPSS, chi-square, percentage frequency and tested at probability level of 0.05. Eight hundred and thirty two respondents were collected. Six hundred and twenty five (72.2%) were from Semi-urban while 207(27.8%) were from the rural regions. The age range was between 15 and 72 years with a mean age of 30.89+/-11.58. The educational level showed that 304(36.4%) had tertiary education. Six hundred and four (72.6%) have previous knowledge of cancer of the breast, 149(17.4%) offered possible aetiological reasons, and 341(41.1%) have some knowledge of associated symptoms.

Austria, Germany, The Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia and Switzerland cover a population of 13 million inhabitants. Cancer registries in these countries supplied incidence and survival data for 465 000 cases of cancer. The prevalence of stomach, colon, rectum, lung, breast, cervix uteri, corpus uteri and prostate cancer, as well as skin melanoma, Hodgkin's disease, leukaemia and all malignant neoplasms combined was estimated for the end of 1992. A large heterogeneity was observed within central European countries. For all cancers combined, estimates ranged from 730 per 100 000 in Poland (men) to 3350 per 100 000 in Germany (women). Overall cancer prevalence was the highest in Germany and Switzerland, and the lowest in Poland and Slovenia. In Slovakia, prevalence was higher than average for men and lower than average for women. This was observed for almost all ages. As shown by incidence data, breast cancer was the most frequent malignancy among women in all countries. Among men, prostate cancer was the leading malignancy in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, and lung cancer was the major cancer in Slovenia, Slovakia and Poland. The Netherlands had a high prevalence of both prostate and lung cancer. Time-related magnitude of prevalence within each country and the variability of such proportions across the countries has been estimated and cancer prevalence is given by time since diagnosis (1 year, 1-5 years, 5-10 years, >10 years) for each site. The weight of 1-year prevalence (248 per 100 000 among men and 253 per 100 000 among women) was <15% of total prevalence. Prevalent cases between 1 and 5 years since diagnosis represented between 22% and 34% of the total prevalence. Prevalent cases diagnosed from 5 to 10 years before (335 per 100 000 for men and 505 per 100 000 for women) represented between 17% and 23% of prevalent cancers. Finally, long-term cancer prevalence (diagnosed >10 years before), reflecting long-term survival, and number of people considered as cured from cancer were 490 per 100 000 for men and 1028 per 100 000 for women, with a range between 26% (The Netherlands, men) and 50% (Slovakia, women). It is clear from observing countries in Central Europe, that high cancer prevalence is associated with well-developed economies. This burden of cancer could be interpreted as a paradoxical effect of better treatments and thereby survival. It could also be taken as a sign for not being satisfied with the advances in treating patients diagnosed with cancer, and for supporting more primary prevention."

Between July 1999 and June 2001, 254 patients who had been operated on for breast cancer and who were to receive postoperative radiation therapy were randomly allocated to application of either trolamine (128 patients) or calendula (126 patients) on the irradiated fields after each session. The primary end point was the occurrence of acute dermatitis of grade 2 or higher. Prognostic factors, including treatment modalities and patient characteristics, were also investigated. Secondary end points were the occurrence of pain, the quantity of topical agent used, and patient satisfaction. The occurrence of acute dermatitis of grade 2 or higher was significantly lower (41% v 63%; P <.001) with the use of calendula than with trolamine. Moreover, patients receiving calendula had less frequent interruption of radiotherapy and significantly reduced radiation-induced pain. Calendula was considered to be more difficult to apply, but self-assessed satisfaction was greater. Body mass index and adjuvant chemotherapy before radiotherapy after lumpectomy were significant prognostic factors for acute dermatitis. Calendula is highly effective for the prevention of acute dermatitis of grade 2 or higher and should be proposed for patients undergoing postoperative irradiation for breast cancer."

Message distribution and collective behavior change within family networks will be mapped using social network analysis. The relative intervention impact will be compared between families from different ethnic backgrounds. One hundred and fifty mothers (50 Anglo-Australian, 50 Italian-Australian, 50 Vietnamese-Australian) will be recruited, with four or more other family members across three generations, including a child (aged 10-18 years). Each family is randomly assigned to intervention or control. At baseline and 6-month follow-up, all participants complete surveys to assess dietary and physical activity intentions and behaviors, attitudes towards food, and perceived disease risk. Intervention families receive a visual pedigree detailing their FHH of diabetes, heart disease, breast and bowel cancer, a health education workbook to ascertain members' disease risk (i.e. average or above average risk), and screening and primary prevention recommendations. After completion of follow-up assessments, controls will receive their pedigree and workbook. The primary hypothesis is that attitudes and lifestyle behaviors will improve more within families exposed to FHH feedback, although the extent of this improvement may vary between families from different ethnic backgrounds. Additionally, the extent of improvement in the treatment group will be moderated by the level of family disease risk, with above-average risk leading to greater improvement. A secondary aim will explore different family members' roles in message distribution and collective responses to risk using social network approaches and to compare network functioning between families with different ethnic backgrounds. Results will guide future health promotion programs aimed at improving lifestyle factors. This research will assess whether FHH can motivate families to adopt family-level strategies to support health promoting behaviors. Secondary analyses aim to identify change agents within the family who are particularly effective in shifting normative behaviors.

Views of Low-Income Women of Color at Increased Risk for Breast Cancer.,"E Anderson, Tejada, B Warnecke, Hoskins",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29657180/,Individual risk assessment (IRA) for breast cancer may increase adherence to risk-appropriate screening and prevention measures. But knowledge gaps exist regarding how best to communicate IRA results and support women at increased risk in future health care decisions. Better understanding the views of low-income women of color can inform efforts to conduct IRA in an ethical and respectful manner.,"Individual risk assessment (IRA) for breast cancer may increase adherence to risk-appropriate screening and prevention measures. However, knowledge gaps exist regarding how best to communicate IRA results and support women at increased risk in future health care decisions, in part because patients conceptualize and make meaning of risk differently from the medical community. Better understanding the views of low-income women of color identified as being at increased risk for breast cancer can inform efforts to conduct IRA in an ethical and respectful manner. We conducted in-depth interviews with 13 low-income African American and Latina women who receive care at a federally qualified health center (FQHC) and had recently learned of their increased risk for breast cancer. These interviews explored their experience of the IRA process, their interpretation of what being at increased risk means, and their reactions to provider recommendations. Eight key themes were identified. We conclude with recommendations for the implementation of IRA for breast cancer in underserved primary care settings."

Patients and Methods We identified 8,745 patients age â‰¥ 18 years from a medical and pharmacy claims database for 14 commercial US health plans. This retrospective analysis included patients with breast cancer who began first-cycle chemotherapy from 2008 to 2013 using docetaxel and cyclophosphamide (TC); docetaxel, carboplatin, and trastuzumab (TCH); or doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (conventional-dose AC) regimens. Primary prophylaxis (PP) was defined as G-CSF administration within 5 days of beginning chemotherapy. Outcome was neutropenia, fever, or infection-related hospitalization within 21 days of initiating chemotherapy. Multivariable regressions and number-needed-to-treat analyses were used. Results A total of 4,815 patients received TC (2,849 PP; 1,966 no PP); 2,292 patients received TCH (1,444 PP; 848 no PP); and 1,638 patients received AC (857 PP; 781 no PP) regimen.

For the TC regimen, 20 patients (95% CI, 16 to 26) would have to be treated for 21 days to avoid one neutropenia-related hospitalization; with the TCH regimen, 18 patients (95% CI, 13 to 25) would have to be treated. Conclusion Primary G-CSF prophylaxis was associated with low-to-modest benefit in lowering neutropenia-related hospitalization in patients with breast cancer who received TC and TCH regimens. Further evaluation is needed to better understand which patients benefit most from G-CSF prophylaxis in this setting."

In Egypt women's breast cancer had the highest frequency. The present study was conducted to study the association between breast cancer and some reproductive factors as well as to find out (if possible) predictors for occurrence of breast cancer. A hospital based case control study was carried out in Alexandria Main University Hospital where, 129 histopathologically confirmed incident primary breast cancer cases were included. An equal number of a control group matched by age were selected from the visitors of the same hospital. Data related to women's reproductive period were collected from both cases and controls. The results revealed that there was no statistically significant difference between cases and controls as regards menopausal status, menstruation span, number of births, spontaneous and induced abortion, twin birth, breast feeding and use of oral contraceptives. There was an increasing risk of breast cancer, with the presence of positive family history of breast cancer decreasing age at menarche, increasing age at first full-term pregnancy, widening of the interval between menarche and first full-term pregnancy, increasing age at last full-term pregnancy and shortening of the interval since last birth. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that positive family history of breast cancer, young age at menarche, late age at last full-term pregnancy and wide inter-birth interval were significant predictors for occurrence of breast cancer. The results of the study pinpoint that conduction of public health education programmes focusing on the modifiable risk factors are required."
The lifetime risk of developing breast cancer.,"Feuer, Wun, Boring, Flanders, Timmel, Tong",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8492317/,The lifetime risk of developing breast cancer in U.S. women is often quoted as one in nine. Many estimates have used cancer rates derived from total rather than the cancer-free population. A common misperception is that the lifetime risk estimate assumes all women live to a particular age.,"The lifetime risk of developing breast cancer in U.S. women, often quoted as one in nine, is a commonly cited cancer statistic. However, many estimates have used cancer rates derived from total rather than the cancer-free population and have not properly accounted for multiple cancers in the same individual. Our purpose was to provide a revised method for calculating estimates of the lifetime risk of developing breast cancer and to aid in interpretation of the estimates. A multiple decrement life table was derived by applying age-specific incidence and mortality rates from cross-sectional data to a hypothetical cohort of women. Incidence, mortality, and population data from 1975-1988 were used, representing the geographic areas of the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program. The incidence rates reflected only the first breast primary cancer; mortality rates reflected causes other than breast cancer. The population denominator used in calculating incidence rates was adjusted to reflect only those women without previously diagnosed breast cancers in the hypothetical cohort. Our calculations showed an overall lifetime risk for developing invasive breast cancer of approximately one in eight with use of 1987-1988 SEER data, although up to age 85, it was still the commonly quoted one in nine. Our estimate was calculated assuming constant age-specific rates derived from 1987-1988 SEER data. Because incidence and mortality rates change over time, conditional risk estimates over the short term (10 or 20 years) may be more reliable. A large portion of the rise in the lifetime risk of breast cancer estimated using 1975-1977 data (one in 10.6) to an estimate using 1987-1988 data (one in eight) may be attributed to 1) early detection of prevalent cases due to increased use of mammographic screening and 2) lower mortality due to causes other than breast cancer. A common misperception is that the lifetime risk estimate assumes that all women live to a particular age (e.g., 85 or 95). In fact, the calculation assumes that women can die from causes other than breast cancer at any possible age. Cutting off the lifetime risk calculation at age 85 assumes that no women develop breast cancer after that age. While the lifetime risk of developing breast cancer rose over the period 1976-1977 to 1987-1988, the lifetime risk of dying of breast cancer increased from one in 30 to one in 28, reflecting generally flat mortality trends."

National data based on a total of 4388 cases diagnosed during the year 1998 were reviewed and analyzed. Crude and age-standardized rates (ASRs) per 100,000 population were calculated and results were contrasted with estimates from developed and selected developing countries in the region. Among males, bladder (18.5%), prostate (14.2%), and lung cancer (14.1%) were the most frequently reported malignancies. Among females, breast cancer alone accounted for over a third of all cancers, followed by colon cancer (5.8%), and cancer of the corpus uteri (4.8%). Sex-differentials in incidence rates were highest for tobacco-related cancers (lung, larynx, and bladder). Compared with current estimates worldwide, ASRs for bladder cancer in Lebanon showed strikingly high rates. Whereas ASRs for breast and prostate cancer remained lower than those observed in developed countries, they were greater than those estimated from neighboring countries with a similar epidemiological transition as Lebanon. Findings of the comparative assessments most likely reflect differentials in prevalence of risk factors and lifestyle variables (e.g., lung and breast cancers) and can be partly explained by improvement in cancer detection rate in recent years (for prostate cancer). The implications of the results in light of primary prevention activities, screening practices, and research initiatives in Lebanon are discussed."
Does a homeopathic medicine reduce hot flushes induced by adjuvant endocrine therapy in localized breast cancer patients?

Homeopathy might allow a better management of hot flushes (HF),"Endocrine therapy (ET) used to reduce the risk of recurrence in hormone receptor-expressing disease (75% of breast cancers) is associated with worsening of climacteric symptoms with a negative impact on quality of life (QoL). Homeopathy might allow a better management of hot flushes (HF). In this multicenter randomized double-blind placebo-controlled phase III study ( ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01246427), we enrolled â‰¥ 18 years old women with histologically proven non metastatic localized breast cancer, with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-Performance Status (ECOG-PS) â‰¤ 1, treated for at least 1 month with adjuvant ET, and complaining about moderate to severe HF. Patients should not be scheduled for chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and had no associated pathology known to induce HF. After a 2- to 4-week placebo administration, we randomly assigned (1:1) patients with HFS â‰¥ 10 using an interactive web-based centralized platform to BRN-01 homeopathic medicine complex (ActheaneÂ®) in arm A or Placebo (Arm P). Randomization was stratified by adjuvant ET (taxoxifen/aromatase inhibitor) and recruiting site. HF scores (HFS) were calculated as the mean of HF frequencies before randomization, at 4, and at 8 weeks post-randomization (pre-, 4w,- and 8w-) weighted by a 4-level intensity scale. Primary endpoint was assessed at 4-week post-randomization, as the variation between pre- and 4w-HFS. Secondary endpoints included HFS variation between pre- and 8w-HFS, compliance and tolerance assessed 8 weeks after randomization, and QoL and satisfaction assessed at 4- and 8-week post-randomization. Two hundred ninety-nine patients were included, and 138 (46.2%) randomized (A, 65; P, 73). Median 4w-HFS absolute variation (A, - 2.9; P, - 2.5 points, p = 0.756) and relative decrease (A, - 17%; P, - 15%, p = 0.629) were not statistically different. However, 4w-HFS decreased for 46 (75%) in A vs 48 (68%) patients in P arm. 4w-QoL was stable or improved for respectively 43 (72%) vs 51 (74%) patients (p = 0.470). The efficacy endpoint was not reached, and BRN-01 administration was not demonstrated as an efficient treatment to alleviate HF symptoms due to adjuvant ET in breast cancer patients. However, the study drug administration led to decreased HFS with a positive impact on QoL. Without any recommended treatment to treat or alleviate the HF-related disabling symptoms, ActheaneÂ® could be a promising option, providing an interesting support for better adherence to ET, thereby reducing the risk of recurrence with a good tolerance profile."
Estimates of cancer incidence and mortality in Europe in 1995.,"Bray, Sankila, Ferlay, Parkin","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11750846/,"There were an estimated 2.6 million new cases of cancer in Europe in 1995, representing over one-quarter of the world burden of cancer. Overall incidence rates in men were highest in the Western European countries (420.9 per 100,000) Eastern European men had the second highest rates of cancer (414.2), with extremely high rates being observed in Hungary (566.6) and in the Czech Republic (480.5)","Cancer incidence and mortality estimates for 1995 are presented for the 38 countries in the four United Nations-defined areas of Europe, using World Health Organization mortality data and published estimates of incidence from national cancer registries. Additional estimation was required where national incidence data was not available, and the method involved incorporating the high quality incidence and mortality data available from the expanding number of population-based cancer registries in Europe. There were an estimated 2.6 million new cases of cancer in Europe in 1995, representing over one-quarter of the world burden of cancer. The corresponding number of deaths from cancer was approximately 1.6 million. After adjusting for differing population age structures, overall incidence rates in men were highest in the Western European countries (420.9 per 100,000), with only Austria having a rate under 400. Eastern European men had the second highest rates of cancer (414.2), with extremely high rates being observed in Hungary (566.6) and in the Czech Republic (480.5). The lowest male all-cancer rate by area was observed in the Northern European countries, with fairly low rates seen in Sweden (356.6) and the UK (377.8). In contrast to men, the highest rates in women were observed in Northern Europe (315.9) and were particularly high in Denmark (396.2) and the other Nordic countries excepting Finland. The rates of cancer in Eastern European women were lower than in the other three areas, although as with men, female rates were very high in Hungary (357.2) and in the Czech Republic (333.6). There was greater disparity in the mortality rates within Europe--generally, rates were highest in Eastern European countries, notably in Hungary, reflecting a combination of poorer cancer survival rates and a higher incidence of the more lethal neoplasms, notably cancer of the lung. Lung cancer, with an estimated 377,000 cases, was the most common cancer in Europe in 1995. Rates were particularly high in much of Eastern Europe reflecting current and past tobacco smoking habits of many of its inhabitants. Together with cancers of colon and rectum (334,000), and female breast (321,000), the three cancers represented approximately 40% of new cases in Europe. In men, the most common primary sites were lung (22% of all cancer cases), colon and rectum (12%) and prostate (11%), and in females, breast (26%), colon and rectum (14%) and stomach (7%). The number of deaths is determined by survival, as well as incidence; by far the most common cause of death was lung cancer (330,000)--about one-fifth of the total number of cancer deaths in Europe in 1995. Deaths from cancers of the colon and rectum (189,000) ranked second, followed by deaths from stomach cancer (152,000), which due to poorer survival ranked higher than breast cancer (124,000). Lung cancer was the most common cause of death from cancer in men (29%). Breast cancer was the leading cause of death in females (17%). Cancer registries are a unique source of information on cancer incidence and survival, and are used here with national mortality to demonstrate the very substantial burden of cancer in Europe, and the scope for prevention.

Furthermore, insulin and markers of insulin resistance, such as abdominal obesity, high blood glucose, high serum testosterone and metabolic syndrome, may affect both BC incidence and prognosis. We hypothesized that all these factors might be relevant also for hereditary BC, due to a deleterious mutation of BRCA genes. Epidemiological observation suggested that weight, energy intake (usually associated with higher bio-availability of growth factors) and physical activity may be relevant in BRCA mutation carriers. Mechanistic studies hypothesized a functional interaction between BRCA genes and the IGF-I system. We have provided some evidence that high serum levels of IGF-I are associated with a significantly increased penetrance. We are recruiting a larger cohort of BRCA mutation carriers in order to test potential modulators of penetrance and prognosis. Within this cohort, we have planned a randomized controlled trial to test whether moderate calorie and protein restriction, together with physical activity, decrease IGF-I. Eligible study subjects are women with or without BC, aged 18-70, with a proven deleterious BRCA mutation, and without metastases. All the women will receive recommendations for the dietary prevention of cancer. The women will be then randomized into an active life-style intervention group and into a control group that will receive only the baseline recommendations. We expect to significantly reduce IGF-I in the intervention group. This trial and the subsequent cohort follow-up might open up primary prevention options for genetic BC."
Individual cancer risk as a function of current age and risk profile.,"Goossens, De GrÃ¨ve",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20706123/,"People need to have a correct assessment of their own risk, which is often underestimated or overestimated. Currently, the method that is used most often is 'indirect cumulative risk' (ICR) We discuss several drawbacks of using ICR in individual counselling and therefore use an alternative method.","Behavioural changes are an important partner in the fight against cancer (primary prevention or the choice to participate in secondary prevention). To make such behavioural changes, people need to have a correct assessment of their own risk, which is often underestimated or overestimated. These risk estimates depend, among others, on the calculation method that is used. Currently, the method that is used most often is 'indirect cumulative risk' (ICR). We discuss several drawbacks of using ICR in individual counselling and therefore use an alternative method. In this alternative (life table method) we calculated 10-year risks for a whole range of cancers as a function of the current age and risk profile, while taking into account other causes of death. These estimates can easily be used to give an individualized assessment of the risk of cancer. Regardless of the risk estimation method used, the risk needs to be broken down for 'risk factors'. If only the risk for an average person of the population is given, this means a small overestimation for the non-risk group, but a significant underestimation for the at-risk group. When we compare the life table risk as a function of risk factors to the more commonly used ICR, large differences are found, especially in prostate, breast and lung carcinomas. The life table method, although it has certain limitations, has advantages over the ICR method for individual counselling. To our knowledge this is the first overview in which 10-year risks as a function of the current risk profile are given for multiple cancers. The calculated risks are primarily intended to better inform people who are considering preventive measures. For example, for a 40-year-old woman without familial risk who is considering the pros and cons of breast cancer mammographic screening, it is more interesting to know that she has a 0.7% chance of getting breast cancer in the next 5 years, rather than being told that 11% of women get breast cancer during their lives (ICR 0-74). Current smokers can now be given absolute risk reduction estimates of smoking cessation. To keep the life table risk estimates up to date, they must be repeated every couple of years, using up-to-date incidence and mortality data."

We examine the structural, personal, and caretaking challenges of adolescent mothers and their children in rural South Africa compared to adult mothers over the first 24 months post-birth. A cohort of sequential births (n = 470/493) in the rural OR Tambo District was recruited and reassessed at 3, 6, 9, 12, and at 24 months post-birth, with a retention rate above 84% at all timepoints. Maternal and child outcomes were examined over time using multiple linear and logistic regressions. Adolescent mothers reflect 17% of births (n = 76/458). Adolescent mothers were more likely to have water in their households, but less likely to live with a partner and to be seropositive for HIV than adult mothers. Risks posed by mental health symptoms, alcohol, and partner violence were similar. Adolescents exclusively breastfed for shorter time and it took longer for them to secure a child grant compared to adult mothers. Although obtaining immunizations was similar, growth was significantly slower for infants of adolescent mothers compared to adult mothers over time. In rural South Africa, almost one in five pregnant women is an adolescent. Caretaking tasks influencing child growth, especially breastfeeding and securing the child grant appear as the greatest problems for adolescent compared to adult mothers."
Risk prevalence and screening for cancer by general practitioners.,"Heywood, Sanson-Fisher, Ring, Mudge","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8047520/,"Study presents cancer risk prevalence and screening rates of patients attending general practitioners.

Conditions addressed include smoking, skin cancer, Pap smears, clinical breast examinations, and mammography. A cross-sectional study of 7,160 patients 18-75 years presenting to 230 general practitioners in a metropolitan and country region in Queensland, Australia, was used. Risk prevalence was assessed from patients' self-report of risk behaviors and screening prior to the consultation. Details of preventive care provided in the consultation were based on doctors' self-report at the conclusion of the consultation. Twenty-seven percent of men and 23% of women smoked, rates being highest in the younger age groups. Using national guidelines, prior screening had not occurred as recommended for men and women as follows: skin cancer screening--66% of men, 70% of women; cervical cancer screening--27%; clinical breast examination--45%; mammography--75%. These patients were thus categorized as ""at risk,"" and screening rates for these patients in the consultation were as follows: smokers--34%; skin cancer--5%; cervical cancer--16%; mammography--4%; clinical breast examination--8%. Significant numbers of patients presenting to general practitioners were at risk of developing cancer, according to national guidelines. Of these, only small proportions of all groups had a preventive intervention by their GP at the consultation identified in this study. While GPs generally see their role in prevention as important, these results raise questions for future cancer prevention policies and training of GPs."

We aimed to compare the risk of any bone fracture and major osteoporotic fractures in survivors of a wide range of cancers versus cancer-free individuals. In this population-based matched cohort study, we used electronic health records from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink linked to hospital data. We included adults (aged â‰¥18 years) eligible for linkage, and we restricted the study start to Jan 2, 1998, onwards and applied administrative censoring on Jan 31, 2020. The cancer survivor group included survivors of the 20 most common cancers. Each individual with cancer was matched (age, sex, and general practice) to up to five controls (1:5) who were cancer-free. The primary outcomes were any bone fracture and any major osteoporotic fracture (pelvic, hip, wrist, spine, or proximal humeral fractures) occurring more than 1 year after index date (ie, the diagnosis date of the matched individual with cancer). We used Cox regression models, adjusted for shared risk factors, to estimate associations between cancer survivorship and bone fractures. 578 160 adults with cancer diagnosed in 1998-2020 were matched to 3 226 404 cancer-free individuals. Crude incidence rates of fractures in cancer survivors ranged between 8Â·39 cases (95% CI 7Â·45-9Â·46) per 1000 person-years for thyroid cancer and 21Â·62 cases (20Â·18-23Â·18) per 1000 person-years for multiple myeloma. Compared with cancer-free individuals, the risk of any bone fracture was increased in 15 of 20 cancers, and of major osteoporotic fractures in 17 of 20 cancers. Effect sizes varied: adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were largest for multiple myeloma (1Â·94, 95% CI 1Â·77-2Â·13) and prostate cancer (1Â·43, 1Â·39-1Â·47); HRs in the range 1Â·20-1Â·50 were seen for stomach, liver, pancreas, lung, breast, kidney, and CNS cancers; smaller associations (HR <1Â·20) were observed for malignant melanoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukaemia, and oesophageal, colorectal, and cervical cancers. Increased risks of major osteoporotic fracture were noted most substantially in multiple myeloma (2Â·25, 1Â·96-2Â·58) and CNS (2Â·12, 1Â·56-2Â·87), liver (1Â·62, 1Â·01-2Â·61), prostate (1Â·60, 1Â·53-1Â·67), and lung cancers (1Â·60, 1Â·44-1Â·77). Effect sizes tended to reduce over time since diagnosis but remained elevated for more than 5 years in several cancers, such as multiple myeloma and stomach, lung, breast, prostate, and CNS cancers. Survivors of most types of cancer were at increased risk of bone fracture for several years after cancer, with variation by cancer type.

Antibiotic Prophylaxis after Immediate Breast Reconstruction: The Reality of Its Efficacy.,"Ranganathan, Sears, Zhong, Chung, Chung, Kozlow, Momoh, Waljee",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29240638/,"Postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis is commonly prescribed to decrease the risk of reconstructive failure, despite conflicting evidence regarding its effectiveness. This study looked at patients who underwent immediate implant reconstruction between 2010 and 2014 with at least 6 months of follow-up.","Numerous techniques are used to prevent infection after immediate implant-based breast reconstruction. Postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis is commonly prescribed to decrease the risk of reconstructive failure, despite conflicting evidence regarding its effectiveness. The authors studied whether postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis decreases the risk of infection-related explantation in the setting of immediate prosthesis-based breast reconstruction. Using Truven MarketScan databases, the authors identified all patients who underwent immediate implant reconstruction between January of 2010 and June of 2014 with at least 6 months of follow-up. Postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis was defined as any oral antibiotic course to be taken postoperatively based on prescriptions filled within 14 days preoperatively through 24 hours after discharge. Reconstructive failure, defined as explantation because of infection, was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes of interest included wound complications, infection, and readmission for infection. Multivariable regression analyses controlled for demographic variables/comorbidities. Of the 7443 patients, 6049 (81 percent) filled prescriptions for postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis. These patients were equally likely to develop a wound complication (OR, 0.93; 95 percent CI, 0.71 to 1.23) or infection (OR, 0.89; 95 percent CI, 0.70 to 1.14), undergo explantation because of infection (OR, 0.82; 95 percent CI, 0.57 to 1.18), or require readmission for infection (OR, 1.21; 95 percent CI, 0.82 to 1.78) compared with those who did not receive antibiotics. There was no significant difference in the risk of infection-related outcomes based on postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis duration. Postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis was not associated with a reduced risk of infection or explantation following prosthesis-based breast reconstruction. Given rising rates of antibiotic resistance, focusing instead on technical considerations and the management of comorbid conditions may more effectively enhance the safety of breast reconstruction.

However, systematic information on cancer prevalence is largely unavailable. Thirty-eight population-based cancer registries from 17 European countries, participating in EUROPREVAL, provided data on almost 3 million cancer patients diagnosed from 1970 to 1992. Standardised data collection and validation procedures were used and the whole data set was analysed using proven methodology. The prevalence of stomach, colon, rectum, lung, breast, cervix uteri, corpus uteri and prostate cancer, as well as of melanoma of skin, Hodgkin's disease, leukaemia and all malignant neoplasms combined, were estimated for the end of 1992. There were large differences between countries in the prevalence of all cancers combined; estimates ranged from 1170 per 100000 in the Polish cancer registration areas to 3050 per 100000 in southern Sweden. For most cancers, the Swedish, Swiss, German and Italian areas had high prevalence, and the Polish, Estonian, Slovakian and Slovenian areas had low prevalence. Of the total prevalent cases, 61% were women and 57% were 65 years of age or older. Cases diagnosed within 2 years of the reference date formed 22% of all prevalent cases. Breast cancer accounted for 34% of all prevalent cancers in females and colorectal cancer for 15% in males. Prevalence tended to be high where cancer incidence was high, but the prevalence was highest in countries where survival was also high. Prevalence was low where general mortality was high (correlation between general mortality and the prevalence of all cancers = -0.64) and high where gross domestic product was high (correlation = +0.79). Thus, the richer areas of Europe had higher prevalence, suggesting that prevalence will increase with economic development. EUROPREVAL is the largest project on prevalence conducted to date. It has provided complete and accurate estimates of cancer prevalence in Europe, constituting essential information for cancer management. The expected increases in prevalence with economic development will require more resources; allocation to primary prevention should therefore be prioritised."

There were 3470 exclusive VA users and 4523 dual VA users. Dual users were significantly more likely to be older and white, have higher incomes, have graduated from college, and be insured when compared with exclusive VA users. In unadjusted analyses, dual users received higher rates of recommended services. After adjustment for patient characteristics, use of recommended services was largely similar among exclusive and dual VA users. Exclusive VA users reported 14% greater use of breast cancer screening and 10% greater use of cholesterol monitoring among patients with hypercholesterolemia, and 6% lower use of prostate cancer screening and 7% lower use of influenza vaccination. After adjustment for patient characteristics, exclusive and dual VA users reported similar rates of recommended ambulatory service use."

Intervention into carcinogenesis or alteration of the natural history of cancer requires a clear understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease and patient acceptance of interval surveillance. Because etiologic information and patient compliance are frequently limited, careful scrutiny of recommendations for cancer screening or prevention is essential. It is through taking detailed family, occupational, and carcinogen-exposure histories and doing a thorough physical examination that the primary care physician can best utilize information regarding the risk of cancer and the benefits of available methods of prevention and treatment."

This additional information may be relevant to management of patients receiving potentially cardiotoxic cancer treatment.,"Echocardiography provides both morphological and functional information offering a potential advantage over nuclear medicine gated blood pool scans which only estimate ejection fraction. This additional information may be relevant to management of patients receiving potentially cardiotoxic cancer treatment. We retrospectively audited all prechemotherapy echocardiograms (ECHO) ordered by medical oncologists at our institution over a 36 months period. The primary objective was to determine the frequency of cardiac abnormality detection on the initial ECHO. We also looked at the frequency of clinically relevant cardiac abnormalities other than ejection fraction abnormalities including diastolic dysfunction, intracardiac shunts, moderate-severe valvular abnormalities, pulmonary hypertension, ventricular hypertrophy, pericardial effusion, wall motional abnormalities, ventricular dysfunction/dilatation, cardiac tumours and congenital anomalies. Baseline ECHOs were analysed in 217 consecutive patients. Female patients comprised 89% of population, and the majority had breast cancer (75.5%). The median age of the patients at the time of ECHO was 55 years (range, 16 to 87); 13.4% of patients had at least one clinically relevant abnormality on ECHO. Systolic and moderate diastolic dysfunctions were seen in 5% and 2.7%, respectively. Aortic stenosis was seen in five (2.3%) patients. Atrial septal defects were seen in two patients, moderate mitral regurgitations in two patients and left atrial tumour in one patient. A total of 7.4% of patients had abnormalities, which would not have been detected by gated blood pool scan (GBPS). The ECHO resulted in change in chemotherapy plan in 2.8% and referral to cardiology in 3.7%. Our retrospective analysis suggests that prechemotherapy ECHO can provide more useful clinical information than the GBPS, which may impact on clinical management of cancer patients."

The disease is often treated to remission and time to relapse is generally measured in years in many cases. Immune-based therapeutics, such as cancer vaccines, may be able to affect the clinical progression of micrometastatic disease. Immune targets must be identified that have the potential to inhibit tumor growth. Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2) has direct effects on breast cancer proliferation via stimulation of critical signaling pathways. We questioned whether IGFBP-2 was an immune target in breast cancer. IGFBP-2-specific IgG antibody immunity was preferentially detected in breast cancer patients compared with controls (P = 0.0008). To evaluate for the presence of T-cell immunity, we identified potential pan-HLA-DR binding epitopes derived from IGFBP-2 and tested the peptides for immunogenicity. The majority of epitopes elicited peptide-specific T cells in both patients and controls and had high sequence homology to bacterial pathogens. IGFBP-2 peptide-specific T cells could respond to naturally processed and presented IGFBP-2 protein, indicating that these peptides were native epitopes of IGFBP-2. Finally, both immunization with IGFBP-2 peptides as well as adoptive transfer of IGFBP-2-competent T cells mediated an antitumor effect in a transgenic mouse model of breast cancer. This is the first report of IGFBP-2 as a human tumor antigen that may be a functional therapeutic target in breast cancer."

The 20-minute KinFact intervention, based in communication and behavior theory, included reviewing individualized breast/colon cancer risks and an interactive presentation about cancer and communication. Study outcomes included whether participants reported collecting family history, shared cancer risk information with relatives, and the frequency of communication with relatives. Data were collected at baseline, 1, 6, and 14 months. Overall, intervention participants were significantly more likely to gather family cancer information at follow-up (odds ratio [OR]: 2.73; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.01, 3.71) and to share familial cancer information with relatives (OR: 1.85; 95% CI: 1.37, 2.48). Communication frequency (1=not at all; 4=a lot) was significantly increased at follow-up (1.67 vs. 1.54). Differences were not modified by age, race, education, or family history. However, effects were modified by pregnancy status and genetic literacy. Intervention effects for information gathering and frequency were observed for nonpregnant women but not for pregnant women. Additionally, intervention effects were observed for information gathering in women with high genetic literacy, but not in women with low genetic literacy. The KinFact intervention successfully promoted family communication about cancer risk. Educating women to enhance their communication skills surrounding family history may allow them to partner more effectively with their families and ultimately their providers in discussing risks and prevention."

The Mother's Gift study was a prospective, blinded, randomized controlled trial that assigned 340 pregnant Bangladeshi mothers to receive either trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine, or 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine during the third trimester. We evaluated breast milk at birth, 6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months, and serum at 10 weeks and 12 months. Milk and serum specimens from 57 subjects were assayed for specific IgA antibody to influenza A/New Caledonia (H1N1) using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a virus neutralization assay, and for total IgA using ELISA. Influenza-specific IgA levels in breast milk were significantly higher in influenza vaccinees than in pneumococcal controls for at least 6 months postpartum (p = 0.04). Geometric mean concentrations ranged from 8.0 to 91.1 ELISA units/ml in vaccinees, versus 2.3 to 13.7 ELISA units/mL in controls. Virus neutralization titers in milk were 1.2 to 3 fold greater in vaccinees, and correlated with influenza-specific IgA levels (r = 0.86). Greater exclusivity of breastfeeding in the first 6 months of life significantly decreased the expected number of respiratory illness with fever episodes in infants of influenza-vaccinated mothers (p = 0.0042) but not in infants of pneumococcal-vaccinated mothers (p = 0.4154). The sustained high levels of actively produced anti-influenza IgA in breast milk and the decreased infant episodes of respiratory illness with fever suggest that breastfeeding may provide local mucosal protection for the infant for at least 6 months.

Education should include the importance of vaccines and the rationale for their necessity during each stage of life. The current adult vaccine schedule assists providers to determine the need for vaccines.,"Women's healthcare providers are encouraged to incorporate immunizations into their clients' care. Because women often rely on their healthcare provider for primary and preventive care, that provider may dramatically improve clients' quality of life by decreasing the risk of vaccine-preventable diseases. Women often assume responsibility for the entire family's health, and educating women can prevent disease in the household. Women's healthcare providers should offer and promote these vaccines: hepatitis B, varicella, measles/mumps/rubella, and combined tetanus/diphtheria toxoids for adolescent and young adult women, inactivated influenza vaccine during pregnancy, and pneumococcal, influenza, and tetanus/diphtheria vaccines for the adult or elderly woman. Education should include the importance of vaccines and the rationale for their necessity during each stage of life. Several strategies for implementing and supporting an immunization program have been shown to improve adult immunization rates. These include employing such protocols as standing orders, screening for adult immunizations at each office encounter, and using previously developed immunization documentation forms. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations, vaccine information statements (VIS), and storage and handling guidelines are readily available at low or no cost through CDC and professional organizations or immunization interest group websites. The current adult vaccine schedule assists providers to determine the need for vaccines by displaying graphically both age and medical risk factors."

The updated guidelines do not further recommend reducing house dust mite allergen exposure as a measure of primary prevention. New suggestions include the avoidance of overweight, and reduction of the exposure to indoor and/or outdoor air pollutants. In line with the current guidelines, there is no scientific evidence that prolonged introduction of solid food is an allergy-preventive measure. Consequently, even children with a family history of atopy can introduce solid foods at the beginning of the 5th month. The recommendations on avoiding environmental tobacco smoke, breast feeding over 4 months, avoiding a mold-promoting indoor climate, vaccination according to current recommendations, and avoidance of furry pets (especially cats) in risk babies have remained unchanged."
Variation in screening mammography and Papanicolaou smear by primary care physician specialty and gatekeeper plan (United States).,"Haggstrom, Phillips, Liang, Haas, Tye, Kerlikowske","Journal Article, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15577290/,Cross-sectional study of women in a national sample. Screening mammography or Pap smear within the previous two years was measured by patient self-report. Key independent variables were primary care physician specialty and whether the patient had a gatekeeper.,"To assess whether the specialty of a patient's primary care physician or being part of a gatekeeper plan influence breast and cervical cancer screening. Cross-sectional study of women in a national sample. For mammography, we studied women aged 40 and above, and for Papanicolaou (Pap) smear, women aged 18-65 years. Screening mammography or Pap smear within the previous two years was measured by patient self-report. The key independent variables were primary care physician specialty and whether the patient had a gatekeeper. Among women seen by a family practice physician, there was a higher probability of being screened if the patient was part of a gatekeeper plan than if the patient was not part of a gatekeeper plan: mammography (OR = 1.35; 95% CI = 1.20-1.52) and Pap smear (OR = 1.60; 95% CI = 1.34-1.91). Among women seen by an internal medicine physician, cancer screening did not vary significantly by gatekeeper status. The impact of gatekeeper plans upon cancer screening varies according to the primary care physician's specialty. Policy interventions designed to increase cancer screening should take into account different responses to gatekeeper requirements among different types of providers."
"Prevention of doxorubicin-induced Cardiotoxicity by pharmacological non-hypoxic myocardial preconditioning based on Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) and carvedilol direct antioxidant effects: study protocol for a pilot, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial (CarDHA trial).","Carrasco, Ramirez, Nes, Schuster, Aguayo, Morales, Ramos, Hasson, Sotomayor, Henriquez, CortÃ©s, Erazo, Salas, Gormaz","Journal Article, Randomized Controlled Trial",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32019575/,"Anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity (AIC) has been associated with poor clinical outcomes. Carvedilol, a Î²-blocker with unique antioxidant properties, emerged as a strategy to prevent AIC, but recent trials question its effectiveness.

Carvedilol, a Î²-blocker with unique antioxidant properties, emerged as a strategy to prevent AIC, but recent trials question its effectiveness. Some evidence suggests that the antioxidant, not the Î²-blocker effect, could prevent related cardiotoxicity. However, carvedilol's antioxidant effects are probably not enough to prevent cardiotoxicity manifestations in certain cases. We hypothesize that breast cancer patients taking carvedilol as well as a non-hypoxic myocardial preconditioning based on docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an enhancer of cardiac endogenous antioxidant capacity, will develop less subclinical cardiotoxicity manifestations than patients randomized to double placebo. We designed a pilot, randomized controlled, two-arm clinical trial with 32 patients to evaluate the effects of non-hypoxic cardiac preconditioning (DHA) plus carvedilol on subclinical cardiotoxicity in breast cancer patients undergoing anthracycline treatment. The trial includes four co-primary endpoints: changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) determined by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR); changes in global longitudinal strain (GLS) determined by two-dimensional echocardiography (ECHO); elevation in serum biomarkers (hs-cTnT and NT-ProBNP); and one electrocardiographic variable (QTc interval). Secondary endpoints include other imaging, biomarkers and the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events during follow-up. The enrollment and follow-up for clinical outcomes is ongoing. We expect a group of anthracycline-treated breast cancer patients exposed to carvedilol and non-hypoxic myocardial preconditioning with DHA to show less subclinical cardiotoxicity manifestations than a comparable group exposed to placebo.

Breast cancer risk counseling may help women to learn about their risk and appropriate options of testing. This study measured the effects of an intervention in-person and by telephone, compared to a control group. Participants were 340 women, recruited through a network of primary care physicians. They received a baseline questionnaire in the mail, were randomized to one of the three study arms, and completed a follow-up survey 3 months later. Both types of counseling were very well received. The counseling decreased women's cancer worry, risk perceptions, and intentions to pursue genetic testing. There were similar effects for both in-person and telephone counseling. Genetic counseling can be used to inform women at all risk levels about their breast cancer risk. Breast cancer risk counseling can be done in-person and by telephone--thereby reaching women in remote areas."
A molecular signature of normal breast epithelial and stromal cells from Li-Fraumeni syndrome mutation carriers.,"Herbert, Chanoux, Liu, Baenziger, Goswami, McClintick, Edenberg, Pennington, Lipkin, Kopelovich","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21311097/,"Changes in gene expression during cancer initiation should enable discovery of biomarkers for risk assessment, early detection and targets for chemoprevention.

It has been previously demonstrated that altered mRNA and proteome signatures of morphologically normal cells bearing a single inherited ""hit"" in a tumor suppressor gene parallel many changes observed in the corresponding sporadic cancer. Here, we report on the global gene expression profile of morphologically normal, cultured primary breast epithelial and stromal cells from Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) TP53 mutation carriers. Our analyses identified multiple changes in gene expression in both morphologically normal breast epithelial and stromal cells associated with TP53 haploinsufficiency, as well as interlocking pathways. Notably, a dysregulated p53 signaling pathway was readily detectable. Pharmacological intervention with the p53 rescue compounds CP-31398 and PRIMA-1 provided further evidence in support of the central role of p53 in affecting these changes in LFS cells and treatment for this cancer. Because loss of signaling mediated by TP53 is associated with the development and survival of many human tumors, identification of gene expression profiles in morphologically normal cells that carry ""one-hit"" p53 mutations may reveal novel biomarkers, enabling the discovery of potential targets for chemoprevention of sporadic tumors as well."
Subareolar breast abscesses: characteristics and results of surgical treatment.,"Versluijs-Ossewaarde, Roumen, Goris","Journal Article, Multicenter Study",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15871702/,Almost 70% of patients smoked more than 10 cigarettes a day. Recurrence rate after excision of the lactiferous ducts was 28%. Gram-positive bacteria were isolated more frequently. Anaerobic microorganisms were more frequently cultured in recurring subareolar breast abscesses.,Our objective was to describe the characteristics of subareolar breast abscesses and to analyze the results of surgical treatment in relation to the prevention of recurrences. Almost 70% of patients smoked more than 10 cigarettes a day. The recurrence rate after excision of the lactiferous ducts was 28% and after management without excision of the lactiferous ducts was 79% (p < 0.001). Gram-positive bacteria were isolated more frequently in primary subareolar breast abscesses (not significant). Anaerobic microorganisms were more frequently cultured in recurring subareolar breast abscesses (p = 0.02). Definitive treatment of subareolar breast abscesses should consist of excision of the affected lactiferous ducts.
Physician gender and women's preventive services.,"Cassard, Weisman, Plichta, Johnson","Comparative Study, Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9140854/,Physician gender makes a significant difference for two specialty areas and for three preventive services. Patients of women family or general practitioners are more likely than the patients of men to have received a Pap smear or a blood cholesterol test within the last 3 years.,"To determine whether the gender of women's regular physicians, controlling for physician specialty, is associated with women's receiving key preventive services within recommended intervals. Cross-sectional, nationally representative women's health telephone survey conducted by Louis Harris and Associates in February and March 1993 for The Commonwealth Fund. A total of 2,525 women in the continental United States, > or = 18 years old, including oversamples of African-American and Hispanic women. Receipt of each of five preventive services (blood pressure reading, Pap smear, cholesterol test, clinical breast examination, and mammogram) within specific periods. Physician gender makes a significant difference for two specialty areas and for three preventive services. Patients of women family or general practitioners are more likely than the patients of men to have received a Pap smear or a blood cholesterol test within the last 3 years, and the patients of women internists are more likely to have received a Pap test. Physician gender is associated with a higher likelihood of mammography, but this finding was limited to patients ages 40-49 of women family or general practitioners. Physician gender does not affect receipt of blood pressure screening or breast examination. Analyses reveal limited evidence that physician gender affects women's receipt of preventive services. Physician specialty appears to be a more powerful predictor of preventive services received. The limited evidence for a physician gender effect, however, is relevant for those women who rely on a family or general practitioner or an internist for regular care."
Measuring progress against cancer in Europe: has the 15% decline targeted for 2000 come about?,"Boyle, d'Onofrio, Maisonneuve, Severi, Robertson, Tubiana, Veronesi","Comparative Study, Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12881398/,"Cancer deaths in the EU were expected to rise from 850 194 in 1985 to 1 033 083 in 2000. Only Austria and Finland achieved the 15% reductions in deaths in both men and women. Portugal and Greece had the poorest performance, with increases in each gender group. Renewed tobacco control efforts are clearly needed for women.","Against a background of increasing cancer rates in the mid-1980s, Europe Against Cancer launched an ambitious programme aiming to reduce cancer mortality by 15% by the year 2000. A programme of activities and research, focussing on three major themes [prevention (particularly tobacco control), screening, and education and training], was developed together with the European Code Against Cancer. To evaluate the outcome of the programme, all cancer mortality data were abstracted for each member state of the European Union (EU) until the most recent year available. For each gender group in each member state, age-specific rates were estimated for 2000. For each country-gender grouping, the standardized mortality rate (SMR) and expected numbers of deaths in 2000 were calculated based on the age-specific rates for 1985 and the population estimates for 2000. The ratio of the SMR in 2000 to that of 1985, was used as the measure to compare mortality rates. In 1985, there were 850 194 cancer deaths in the EU. Based solely on demographic considerations, this number was expected to rise to 1 033 083 in the year 2000. Between 1985 and 2000, the number of cancer deaths increased in both men (+12%) and women (+9%). The target of a 15% reduction in the expected numbers of cancer deaths in the EU was not met, although the 10% reduction in number of deaths expected in men and 8% in women, along with a 11% reduction in risk of cancer death in men and a 10% reduction in women, was noteworthy. Only Austria and Finland achieved the 15% reductions in deaths in both men and women. The UK and Luxembourg (where the small population and annual number of deaths make interpretation difficult) came close to meeting these targets, as did Italy. Portugal and Greece had the poorest performance, with increases in each gender group. Cancer deaths in the EU were expected to rise from 850 194 in 1985 to 1 033 083 in 2000. It is estimated that there will be 940 510 cancer deaths that year, due to the decline in risk observed since 1985. The Europe Against Cancer programme appears to have been associated with the avoidance of 92 573 cancer deaths in the year 2000. With few exceptions, most countries are experiencing declining trends in cancer death rates, which seem set to continue, at least in the near future. Renewed tobacco control efforts are clearly needed for women, and there is a strong case for the introduction of organized breast and cervix screening programmes in all member states. Continuing to emphasize prevention within cancer control will help to promote the continuing decline in death rates in the future."
Italian cancer burden by broad geographical area.,"Baili, De Angelis, Casella, Grande, Inghelmann, Francisci, Verdecchia, Capocaccia, Meneghini, Micheli","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17899872/,"Cancer burden estimates in Italian regions are available for the period 1970-2010. Historically, Southern Italy had a lower cancer risk than the Center and North. Prostate cancer has become the most frequent male cancer in the Center-North. Colorectal cancer incidence rates have dramatically increased in men.","Cancer burden estimates in Italian regions are available for the period 1970-2010 as a result of the project ""I TUMORI IN ITALIA"" connected with EUROCHIP, the European project on cancer control. The Italian health-care system is organized at a regional level, so regional estimates of cancer indicators are useful to identify priorities for cancer plans. We compared cancer site-specific epidemiological estimates by 3 macro-areas (obtained by grouping regions) to suggest priorities for Italian cancer control plans, both at national and regional levels. Mortality and incidence estimates for all cancers combined and for stomach, colorectal, lung, breast and prostate cancers were downloaded from the website www.tumori.net and aggregated in broad age classes (0-54, 55-74 and 75-84 years) and macro-areas (northern, central and southern Italy). Historically, Southern Italy had a lower cancer risk than the Center and North. After 2000 this epidemiological picture disappeared and the incidence and mortality rates in the Center are reaching those of the North. Also the weight of various cancer sites on all cancers has changed in Italy in the last decades. Lung cancer is still the most frequent cancer in the male population in the South, while in the Center-North it has been surpassed by prostate cancer and colorectal cancer. The lung cancer weight on all cancer deaths is increasing in women. Prostate cancer has become the most frequent male cancer in the Center-North in the age class 55-84. Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in the female population and its incidence rates in the North are higher than those in the Center-South for all age classes. Colorectal cancer incidence rates have dramatically increased in men and colorectal cancer is nowadays the second cancer diagnosed in women in all age classes and macro-areas. From the epidemiological data here presented we derived the following suggestions and observations for cancer control plans: (a) tobacco prevention should focus on the male population in the South, and on female populations in the country as a whole; (b) prevention concerning diet and physical activity (risk factors for colorectal cancer) should be considered mainly for men at a national level; (c) the coverage of breast cancer screening programs should be increased in the Center-South; (d) colorectal cancer screening should be promoted at a national level; (e) PSA testing (that is not actually included among the screening programs recommended) for prostate cancer is probably more widespread in the Center-North, resulting in an increased incidence without any evident decline in mortality as yet."
