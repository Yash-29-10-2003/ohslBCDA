Health Benefits of the Mediterranean Diet: Metabolic and Molecular Mechanisms.,"Tosti, Bertozzi, Fontana","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29244059/," Consuming a Mediterranean diet rich in minimally processed plant foods has been associated with a reduced risk of developing chronic diseases and increased life expectancy . Data from several randomized clinic trials have demonstrated a beneficial effect in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and breast cancer .","Consuming a Mediterranean diet rich in minimally processed plant foods has been associated with a reduced risk of developing multiple chronic diseases and increased life expectancy. Data from several randomized clinic trials have demonstrated a beneficial effect in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and breast cancer. The exact mechanism by which an increased adherence to the traditional Mediterranean diet exerts its favorable effects is not known. However, accumulating evidence indicates that the five most important adaptations induced by the Mediterranean dietary pattern are: (a) lipid-lowering effect, (b) protection against oxidative stress, inflammation and platelet aggregation, (c) modification of hormones and growth factors involved in the pathogenesis of cancer, (d) inhibition of nutrient sensing pathways by specific amino acid restriction, and (e) gut microbiota-mediated production of metabolites influencing metabolic health. More studies are needed to understand how single modifications of nutrients typical of the Mediterranean diet interact with energy intake, energy expenditure, and the microbiome in modulating the key mechanisms that promote cellular, tissue, and organ health during aging."
Exercise Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease in Breast Cancer Survivors.,"Kirkham, Davis","Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26339243/, Breast cancer mortality rates have significantly declined over the past few decades . Women diagnosed with breast cancer are at an elevated risk for cardiovascular disease due in part to the cardiotoxic side effects of treatment . This paper reviews evidence for the role of exercise in prevention of cardiovascular toxicity associated with chemotherapy used in breast cancer .,"Thanks to increasingly effective treatment, breast cancer mortality rates have significantly declined over the past few decades. Following the increase in life expectancy of women diagnosed with breast cancer, it has been recognized that these women are at an elevated risk for cardiovascular disease due in part to the cardiotoxic side effects of treatment. This paper reviews evidence for the role of exercise in prevention of cardiovascular toxicity associated with chemotherapy used in breast cancer, and in modifying cardiovascular risk factors in breast cancer survivors. There is growing evidence indicating that the primary mechanism for this protective effect appears to be improved antioxidant capacity in the heart and vasculature and subsequent reduction of treatment-related oxidative stress in these structures. Further clinical research is needed to determine whether exercise is a feasible and effective nonpharmacological treatment to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in breast cancer survivors, to identify the cancer therapies for which it is effective, and to determine the optimal exercise dose. Safe and noninvasive measures that are sensitive to changes in cardiovascular function are required to answer these questions in patient populations. Cardiac strain, endothelial function, and cardiac biomarkers are suggested outcome measures for clinical research in this field."
Bile Acids and Cancer: Direct and Environmental-Dependent Effects.,"Di Ciaula, Wang, Molina-Molina, Lunardi Baccetto, Calamita, Palmieri, Portincasa","Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29080344/," Bile acids regulate the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, cholesterol and lipids . When disrupted, these homeostatic pathways are able to promote local inflammation, metabolic disorders and, ultimately, cancer . The effect of hydrophobic BAs, in particular, can be linked with cancer in several digestive organs .","Bile acids (BAs) regulate the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, cholesterol and lipids but have also a key role as singalling molecules and in the modulation of epithelial cell proliferation, gene expression and metabolism. These homeostatic pathways, when disrupted, are able to promote local inflammation, systemic metabolic disorders and, ultimately, cancer. The effect of hydrophobic BAs, in particular, can be linked with cancer in several digestive (mainly oesophagus, stomach, liver, pancreas, biliary tract, colon) and extra-digestive organs (i.e. prostate, breast) through a complex series of mechanisms including direct oxidative stress with DNA damage, apoptosis, epigenetic factors regulating gene expression, reduced/increased expression of nuclear receptors (mainly farnesoid X receptor, FXR) and altered composition of gut microbiota, also acting as a common interface between environmental factors (including diet, lifestyle, exposure to toxics) and the molecular events promoting cancerogenesis. Primary prevention strategies (i.e. changes in dietary habits and lifestyle, reduced exposure to environmental toxics) mainly able to modulate gut microbiota and the epigenome, and the therapeutic use of hydrophilic BAs to counterbalance the negative effects of the more hydrophobic BAs might be, in the near future, part of useful tools for cancer prevention and management."
Diabetes and Cancer: Cancer Should Be Screened in Routine Diabetes Assessment.,"Suh, Kim","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31902143/," Cancer incidence appears to be increased in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus . DM represents a risk factor for cancer, particularly hepatocellular, hepatobiliary, pancreas, breast, ovarian, endometrial, and gastrointestinal cancers . Common risk factors such as age, obesity, physical inactivity and smoking may contribute to increased cancer risk in patients with DM .","Cancer incidence appears to be increased in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). DM represents a risk factor for cancer, particularly hepatocellular, hepatobiliary, pancreas, breast, ovarian, endometrial, and gastrointestinal cancers. In addition, there is evidence showing that DM is associated with increased cancer mortality. Common risk factors such as age, obesity, physical inactivity and smoking may contribute to increased cancer risk in patients with DM. Although the mechanistic process that may link diabetes to cancer is not completely understood yet, biological mechanisms linking DM and cancer are hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, increased bioactivity of insulin-like growth factor 1, oxidative stress, dysregulations of sex hormones, and chronic inflammation. However, cancer screening rate is significantly lower in people with DM than that in people without diabetes. Evidence from previous studies suggests that some medications used to treat DM are associated with either increased or reduced risk of cancer. However, there is no strong evidence supporting the association between the use of anti-hyperglycemic medication and specific cancer. In conclusion, all patients with DM should be undergo recommended age- and sex appropriate cancer screenings to promote primary prevention and early detection. Furthermore, cancer should be screened in routine diabetes assessment."
"Cancer-Associated Exosomal CBFB Facilitates the Aggressive Phenotype, Evasion of Oxidative Stress, and Preferential Predisposition to Bone Prometastatic Factor of Breast Cancer Progression.","Hsu, Ma, Ong, Hsieh, Yadav, Yeh, Chao, Lee, Huang, Kuo, Fong, Lin, Su",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35903297/," Circulating exosomes play critical roles in tumorigenesis, distant metastasis, and poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer . Breast cancer cells exhibit high levels of oxidative stress, including protein damage, DNA damage, and lipid peroxidation . We used an online database to analyze the expression and prognostic value of core binding factor subunit <i>β</i> (CBFB) and oxidative stress-related targets .","Despite therapeutic advancements, metastasis remains a major cause in breast cancer-specific mortality. Breast cancer cells are susceptible to oxidative damage and exhibit high levels of oxidative stress, including protein damage, DNA damage, and lipid peroxidation. Some breast cancer risk factors may change the level of endogenous oxidative stress. Circulating exosomes play critical roles in tumorigenesis, distant metastasis, and poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer. We used an online database to analyze the expression and prognostic value of core binding factor subunit <i>β</i> (CBFB) and oxidative stress-related targets in patients with breast cancer. Serum from healthy controls and patients with primary breast cancer or bone metastatic breast cancer in the bone was collected. Exosomes were isolated from the sera or cell culture media. We used an MDA-MB-436-innoculated tumor xenograft mouse model for silencing CBFB. Circulating exosomes from patients with breast cancer metastasis to the bone were rich in CBFB. The human mammary fibroblast cells HMF3A and fibroblasts derived from patient samples cocultured with exosomes had increased <i>α</i>-SMA and vimentin expression and IL-6 and OPN secretion. Similarly, nonmetastatic breast cancer cells cocultured with exosomes exhibited increased levels of certain markers, including vimentin, snail1, CXCR4, and Runx2, and the exosomes had high CBFB expression. Silencing CBFB in metastatic MDA-MB-436 and MDA-MB-157 cells resulted in suppressed migration and invasion and downregulation of vimentin, CXCR4, snail1, Runx2, CD44, and OPN. Conversely, CBFB overexpression resulted in upregulation of Runx2, vimentin, snail1, CD44, and OPN in nonmetastatic T47D and MCF12A cells. The CBFB-rich exosomes derived from MDA-MB-436 cells induced enhanced metastatic phenotypes in the low-metastatic T47D and MCF12A cell lines. Our results revealed that CBFB may promote bone metastasis in patients with breast cancer. Of therapeutic relevance, targeting CBFB resulted in decreased tumor burden and bone metastasis, downregulation of bone metastasis markers, and impaired regulation of oxidative stress-related proteins NAE1 and NOS1."
Translational opportunities for broad-spectrum natural phytochemicals and targeted agent combinations in breast cancer.,"Dalasanur Nagaprashantha, Adhikari, Singhal, Chikara, Awasthi, Horne, Singhal","Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28975625/," Breast cancer prevention and therapy in the context of life-style risk factors and biological drivers is a major focus of developmental therapeutics in oncology . Obesity, alcohol, chronic estrogen signaling and smoking have distinct BC precipitating and facilitating effects that may act alone or in combination . Natural phytochemicals modulate oxidative stress, leptin, integrin, HER2, MAPK, ERK, Wnt/β-catenin and NFκB signaling .","Breast cancer (BC) prevention and therapy in the context of life-style risk factors and biological drivers is a major focus of developmental therapeutics in oncology. Obesity, alcohol, chronic estrogen signaling and smoking have distinct BC precipitating and facilitating effects that may act alone or in combination. A spectrum of signaling events including enhanced oxidative stress and changes in estrogen-receptor (ER)-dependent and -independent signaling drive the progression of BC. Breast tumors modulate ERα/ERβ ratio, upregulate proliferative pathways driven by ERα and HER2 with a parallel loss and/or downregulation of tumor suppressors such as TP53 and PTEN which together impact the efficacy of therapeutic strategies and frequently lead to emergence of drug resistance. Natural phytochemicals modulate oxidative stress, leptin, integrin, HER2, MAPK, ERK, Wnt/β-catenin and NFκB signaling along with regulating ERα and ERβ, thereby presenting unique opportunities for both primary and combinatorial interventions in BC. In this regard, this article focuses on critical analyses of the evidence from multiple studies on the efficacy of natural phytochemicals in BC. In addition, areas in which the combinations of such effective natural phytochemicals with approved and/or developing anticancer agents can be translationally beneficial are discussed to derive evidence-based inference for addressing challenges in BC control and therapy."
Evaluation of the effect of N-acetylcysteine on the prevention and amelioration of paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy in breast cancer patients: a randomized controlled study.,"Khalefa, Shawki, Aboelhassan, El Wakeel","Comparative Study, Journal Article, Randomized Controlled Trial",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32601973/, The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effect of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on the incidence and severity of paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy (PIPN) in breast cancer patients . Oral NAC might reduce the incidence of PIPN and improve the patients' quality of life .,"The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effect of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on the incidence and severity of paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy (PIPN) in breast cancer patients. A prospective randomized controlled open label study was conducted on 75 breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant paclitaxel 80 mg/m<sup>2</sup> weekly for 12 weeks. Eligible patients were randomized to either the low dose group; 1200 mg daily NAC, the high dose group; 1200 mg NAC twice daily or the control group; received paclitaxel only. The primary endpoint was the incidence of different grades of PIPN using National Cancer Institute's common toxicity criteria for adverse event (NCI-CTCAE) while secondary endpoints were the severity of PIPN using modified total neuropathy score (mTNS), quality of life (QOL) using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity (FACT-GOG-NTX) subscale, serum nerve growth factor (NGF), and serum malondialdehyde (MDA). At the end of the 12-week period, the incidence of grade (2, 3) peripheral neuropathy was significantly lower in the high dose group (28.6%) compared to the low dose group (61.9%) and the control group (100%), p value < 0.001. A significant improvement in the mTNS and QOL scores was observed after 6 and 12 weeks in the high dose group and the low dose group compared to the control, p value < 0.001. Significantly higher levels of serum NGF in the high dose group and lower level of serum MDA in the high dose and the low dose group were observed. Oral NAC (1200 mg once and twice daily) might reduce the incidence and severity of PIPN and improve the patients' QOL. Clinical Trial.gov registration number: NCT03492047."
Food Antioxidants and Their Anti-Inflammatory Properties: A Potential Role in Cardiovascular Diseases and Cancer Prevention.,"Griffiths, Aggarwal, Singh, Buttar, Wilson, De Meester","Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28933408/," Mediterranean-style diets caused a significant decline in cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in early landmark studies . The increase in oxidative stress causing inflammation is a unifying hypothesis for predisposing people to atherosclerosis, carcinogenesis, and osteoporosis . The impact of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents on cancer and cardiovascular disease was explored .","Mediterranean-style diets caused a significant decline in cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in early landmark studies. The effect of a traditional Mediterranean diet on lipoprotein oxidation showed that there was a significant reduction in oxidative stress in the intervention group (Mediterranean diet + Virgin Olive Oil) compared to the low-fat diet group. Conversely, the increase in oxidative stress causing inflammation is a unifying hypothesis for predisposing people to atherosclerosis, carcinogenesis, and osteoporosis. The impact of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents on cancer and cardiovascular disease, and the interventive mechanisms for the inhibition of proliferation, inflammation, invasion, metastasis, and activation of apoptosis were explored. Following the Great Oxygen Event some 2.3 billion years ago, organisms have needed antioxidants to survive. Natural products in food preservatives are preferable to synthetic compounds due to their lower volatility and stability and generally higher antioxidant potential. Free radicals, reactive oxygen species, antioxidants, pro-oxidants and inflammation are described with examples of free radical damage based on the hydroxyl, nitric oxide and superoxide radicals. Flavonoid antioxidants with 2- or 3-phenylchroman structures such as quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin, apigenin, and luteolin, constituents of fruits, vegetables, tea, and wine, which may reduce coronary disease and cancer, are described. The protective effect of flavonoids on the DNA damage caused by hydroxyl radicals through chelation is an important mechanism, though the converse may be possible, e.g., quercetin. The antioxidant properties of carotenoids, which are dietary natural pigments, have been studied in relation to breast cancer risk and an inverse association was found with plasma concentrations: higher levels mean lower risk. The manipulation of primary and secondary human metabolomes derived especially from existing or transformed gut microbiota was explored as a possible alternative to single-agent dietary interventions for cancer and cardiovascular disease. Sustained oxidative stress leading to inflammation and thence to possibly to cancer and cardiovascular disease is described for spices and herbs, using curcumin as an example of an intervention, based on activation of transcription factors which suggest that oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, and cancer are closely linked."
Oridonin promotes RSL3-induced ferroptosis in breast cancer cells by regulating the oxidative stress signaling pathway JNK/Nrf2/HO-1.,"Ye, Hu, Sun, Su, Cai, Jiang",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38685305/," The incidence and mortality of breast cancer, the most common malignant tumor among women in the world, are increasing year by year . Ferroptosis is an iron and lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent process, a novel form of cell death that is distinct from apoptosis and is closely related to the progression of cancer . Oridonin (ORI), the primary active ingredient extracted from the Chinese herbal medicine Rabdosia rubescens, has been shown to cause glutathione depletion .","The incidence and mortality of breast cancer, the most common malignant tumor among women in the world, are increasing year by year, which greatly threatens women's health. Ferroptosis is an iron and lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent process, a novel form of cell death that is distinct from apoptosis and is closely related to the progression of breast cancer. Inducing the occurrence of ferroptosis in tumor cells can effectively block its malignant progress in vivo. Oridonin (ORI), the primary active ingredient extracted from the Chinese herbal medicine Rabdosia rubescens, has been shown to cause glutathione depletion and directly inhibit glutathione peroxidase 4 induced cell death by ferroptosis, but its mechanism of action in breast cancer remains inadequately elucidated. Therefore, we further investigated whether ORI could promote RSL3-induced ferroptosis in breast cancer cells by regulating the oxidative stress pathway JNK/Nrf2/HO-1. In our study, we assessed cell survival of RSL3 and ORI treatment by MTT assay, and found that co-treatment with RSL3 and ORI inhibited cell proliferation, as evidenced by the cloning assay. To investigate the ability of ORI to promote RSL3-induced ferroptosis in breast cancer cells, we measured levels of ROS, malondialdehyde, glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and Fe<sup>2+</sup> content. Lipid peroxidation, ROS, and mitochondrial membrane potential levels induced by co-treatment of ORI with RSL3 were reversed by ferrostatin-1, further confirming that the cell death induced by RSL3 and ORI was ferroptosis rather than other programmed cell death modes. Moreover, RSL3 and ORI co-treatment regulated the JNK/Nrf2/HO-1 axis, as demonstrated by western blotting and target activator validation. Our results showed that ORI could enhance the inhibitory effect of RSL3 on breast cancer cells viability via the induction of ferroptosis. Mechanistically, it potentiated RSL3-induced ferroptosis in breast cancer cells by activating the JNK/Nrf2/HO-1 axis. This study provides a theoretical basis for the application of ORI based on the mechanism of ferroptosis, and provides potential natural drug candidates for cancer prevention and treatment."
DNA double-strand break repair genes and oxidative damage in brain metastasis of breast cancer.,"Woditschka, Evans, Duchnowska, Reed, Palmieri, Qian, Badve, Sledge, Gril, Aladjem, Fu, Flores, Gökmen-Polar, Biernat, Szutowicz-Zielińska, Mandat, Trojanowski, Och, Czartoryska-Arlukowicz, Jassem, Mitchell, Steeg","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24948741/," Breast cancer frequently metastasizes to the brain, colonizing a neuro-inflammatory microenvironment .

The molecular pathways facilitating this colonization remain poorly understood. Expression profiling of 23 matched sets of human resected brain metastases and primary breast tumors by two-sided paired t test was performed to identify brain metastasis-specific genes. The implicated DNA repair genes BARD1 and RAD51 were modulated in human (MDA-MB-231-BR) and murine (4T1-BR) brain-tropic breast cancer cell lines by lentiviral transduction of cDNA or short hairpin RNA (shRNA) coding sequences. Their functional contribution to brain metastasis development was evaluated in mouse xenograft models (n = 10 mice per group). Human brain metastases overexpressed BARD1 and RAD51 compared with either matched primary tumors (1.74-fold, P < .001; 1.46-fold, P < .001, respectively) or unlinked systemic metastases (1.49-fold, P = .01; 1.44-fold, P = .008, respectively). Overexpression of either gene in MDA-MB-231-BR cells increased brain metastases by threefold to fourfold after intracardiac injections, but not lung metastases upon tail-vein injections. In 4T1-BR cells, shRNA-mediated RAD51 knockdown reduced brain metastases by 2.5-fold without affecting lung metastasis development. In vitro, BARD1- and RAD51-overexpressing cells showed reduced genomic instability but only exhibited growth and colonization phenotypes upon DNA damage induction. Reactive oxygen species were present in tumor cells and elevated in the metastatic neuro-inflammatory microenvironment and could provide an endogenous source of genotoxic stress. Tempol, a brain-permeable oxygen radical scavenger suppressed brain metastasis promotion induced by BARD1 and RAD51 overexpression. BARD1 and RAD51 are frequently overexpressed in brain metastases from breast cancer and may constitute a mechanism to overcome reactive oxygen species-mediated genotoxic stress in the metastatic brain."
Preclinical and Clinical Evidence of Therapeutic Agents for Paclitaxel-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy.,"Kawashiri, Inoue, Mori, Kobayashi, Mine, Ushio, Kudamatsu, Uchida, Egashira, Shimazoe","Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34445439/," Paclitaxel is an essential drug in the chemotherapy of ovarian, non-small cell lung, breast, gastric, endometrial, and pancreatic cancers .

However, it frequently causes peripheral neuropathy as a dose-limiting factor. Animal models of paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy (PIPN) have been established. The mechanisms of PIPN development have been elucidated, and many drugs and agents have been proven to have neuroprotective effects in basic studies. In addition, some of these drugs have been validated in clinical studies for their inhibitory PIPN effects. This review summarizes the basic and clinical evidence for therapeutic or prophylactic effects for PIPN. In pre-clinical research, many reports exist of neuropathy inhibitors that target oxidative stress, inflammatory response, ion channels, transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, cannabinoid receptors, and the monoamine nervous system. Alternatively, very few drugs have demonstrated PIPN efficacy in clinical trials. Thus, enhancing translational research to translate pre-clinical research into clinical research is important."

We evaluated the correlation between MPO and Gal-3 behavior with CTX. A <i>post hoc</i> analysis was performed in the patients who were included in the CECCY trial. A total of 192 women had her blood samples stored during the study at -80°C until the time of assay in a single batch. Stored blood samples were obtained at baseline, 3 and 6 months after randomization. We excluded samples from 18 patients because of hemolysis. MPO and Gal-3 were measured using Luminex xMAP technology through MILLIPLEX MAP KIT (Merck Laboratories). 26 patients (14.9%) had a decrease of at least 10% in LVEF at 6 months after the initiation of chemotherapy. Among these, there was no significant difference in the MPO and Gal-3 when compared to the group without drop in LVEF (<i>p</i> = 0.85 for both MPO and Gal-3).

Role of TET1 and 5hmC in an Obesity-Linked Pathway Driving Cancer Stem Cells in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.,"Bao, Teslow, Mitrea, Boerner, Dyson, Bollig-Fischer","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32913111/," Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of breast cancer that lacks expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and the HER2 but is enriched with cancer stem cell-like cells .

CSCs are the fraction of cancer cells recognized as the source of primary malignant tumors that also give rise to metastatic recurrence. 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is a DNA epigenetic feature derived from 5-methylcytosine by action of tet methylcytosine dioxygenase enzymes (e.g., TET1); and although TET1 and 5hmC are required to maintain embryonic stem cells, the mechanism and role in CSCs remain unknown. Data presented in this report support the conclusion that TET1 and TET1-dependent 5hmC mediate hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)-dependent activation of a novel gene expression cascade driving self-renewal and expansion of CSCs in TNBC. Evidence presented also supports that the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> affecting this pathway arises due to endogenous mechanisms-including downregulation of antioxidant enzyme catalase in TNBC cells-and by exogenous routes, such as systemic inflammation and oxidative stress coupled with obesity, a known risk factor for TNBC incidence and recurrence. IMPLICATIONS: This study elucidates a pathway dependent on H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and linked to obesity-driven TNBC tumor-initiating CSCs; thus, it provides new understanding that may advance TNBC prevention and treatment strategies."

Most oxidatively induced DNA base lesions are repaired by the base excision repair (BER) pathway which involves the action of various DNA glycosylases.

Nevertheless several lines of evidence indicate that SNPs in DNA repair genes may modulate DNA repair capacity and contribute to risk of disease. This overview provides a convincing picture that SNPs of DNA glycosylases that remove oxidatively generated DNA lesions are susceptibility factors for a wide disease spectrum that includes besides cancer (particularly lung, breast and gastrointestinal tract), cochlear/ocular disorders, myocardial infarction and neurodegenerative disorders which can be all grouped under the umbrella of oxidative stress-related pathologies."

Although genoprotective effects of phytochemicals have been well documented, there is an evident lack of articles which would systematically present the spectrum of anticancer effects by phytochemicals, plant extracts, and plant-derived diet applicable to stratified patient groups at the level of targeted primary (cancer development) and secondary (cancer progression and metastatic disease) prevention. Consequently, clinical implementation of knowledge accumulated in the area is still highly restricted. To stimulate coherent co-development of the dedicated plant bioactive compound investigation on one hand and comprehensive cancer preventive strategies on the other hand, the current paper highlights and deeply analyses relevant evidence available in the area. Key molecular mechanisms are presented to detail genoprotective and anticancer activities of plants and phytochemicals. Clinical implementation is discussed. Based on the presented evidence, advanced chemopreventive strategies in the context of 3P medicine are considered."

This study was conducted within the framework of the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) study, a nutritional intervention trial for primary cardiovascular prevention. We included 4010 women aged between 60 and 80 years who were initially free from breast cancer but at high risk for CVD disease. Dietary information was collected using a validated 137-item food frequency questionnaire. We assigned GI values using the International Tables of GI and GL values. Cases were ascertained through yearly consultation of medical records and through consultation of the National Death Index. Only cases confirmed by results from cytology tests or histological evaluation were included. We estimated multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios for invasive breast cancer risk across tertiles of energy-adjusted dietary GI/GL using Cox regression models. We repeated our analyses using yearly repeated measures of GI/GL intakes. No associations were found between baseline dietary GI/GL and invasive breast cancer incidence. The multivariable hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the top tertile of dietary GI was 1.02 (95% CI: 0.42-2.46) and for dietary GL was 1.00 (95% CI: 0.44-2.30) when compared with the bottom tertile. Repeated-measures analyses yielded similar results. In sensitivity analyses, no significant associations were observed for women with obesity or diabetes. Dietary GI and GL did not appear to be associated with an increased risk for invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women at high CVD risk."
β-Sitosterol as a Promising Anticancer Agent for Chemoprevention and Chemotherapy: Mechanisms of Action and Future Prospects.,"Wang, Wang, Zhang, Liu, Hong","Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37247842/," Cancer is one of the primary causes of death worldwide, and its incidence continues to increase yearly .

Despite significant advances in research, the search for effective and nontoxic preventive and therapeutic agents remains greatly important. Cancer is a multimodal disease, where various mechanisms play significant roles in its occurrence and progression. This highlights the need for multitargeted approaches that are not only safe and inexpensive but also provide effective alternatives for current therapeutic regimens. β-Sitosterol (SIT), the most abundant phytosterol found in various plant foods, represents such an option. Preclinical evidence over the past few decades has overwhelmingly shown that SIT exhibits multiple anticancer activities against varied cancers, such as liver, cervical, colon, stomach, breast, lung, pancreatic, and prostate cancers, in addition to leukemia, multiple myeloma, melanoma, and fibrosarcoma. In this article, we present the latest advances and perspectives on SIT-systematically summarizing its antitumor mechanisms of action into 7 main sections and combining current challenges and prospects-for its use as a promising agent for cancer prevention and treatment. In particular, SIT plays a role in cancer prevention and treatment mainly by enhancing apoptosis, inducing cell cycle arrest, bidirectionally regulating oxidative stress, improving metabolic reprogramming, inhibiting invasion and metastasis, modulating immunity and inflammation, and combating drug resistance. Although SIT holds such great promise, the poor aqueous solubility and bioavailability coupled with low targeting efficacy limit its therapeutic efficacy and clinical application. Further research on novel drug delivery systems may improve these deficiencies. Overall, through complex and pleiotropic mechanisms, SIT has good potential for tumor chemoprevention and chemotherapy. However, no clinical trials have yet proven this potential. This review provides theoretical basis and rationality for the further design and conduct of clinical trials to confirm the anticancer activity of SIT."
Metabolic shifts in residual breast cancer drive tumor recurrence.,"Havas, Milchevskaya, Radic, Alladin, Kafkia, Garcia, Stolte, Klaus, Rotmensz, Gibson, Burwinkel, Schneeweiss, Pruneri, Patil, Sotillo, Jechlinger",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28504653/, Tumor recurrence is the leading cause of breast cancer-related death . Recurrences are largely driven by cancer cells that survive therapeutic intervention . These cells acquire a transcriptionally distinct state from normal epithelium and primary tumors .,"Tumor recurrence is the leading cause of breast cancer-related death. Recurrences are largely driven by cancer cells that survive therapeutic intervention. This poorly understood population is referred to as minimal residual disease. Here, using mouse models that faithfully recapitulate human disease together with organoid cultures, we have demonstrated that residual cells acquire a transcriptionally distinct state from normal epithelium and primary tumors. Gene expression changes and functional characterization revealed altered lipid metabolism and elevated ROS as hallmarks of the cells that survive tumor regression. These residual cells exhibited increased oxidative DNA damage, potentiating the acquisition of somatic mutations during hormonal-induced expansion of the mammary cell population. Inhibition of either cellular fatty acid synthesis or fatty acid transport into mitochondria reduced cellular ROS levels and DNA damage, linking these features to lipid metabolism. Direct perturbation of these hallmarks in vivo, either by scavenging ROS or by halting the cyclic mammary cell population expansion, attenuated tumor recurrence. Finally, these observations were mirrored in transcriptomic and histological signatures of residual cancer cells from neoadjuvant-treated breast cancer patients. These results highlight the potential of lipid metabolism and ROS as therapeutic targets for reducing tumor recurrence in breast cancer patients."
"Increased formation of oxidative DNA damage, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, in human breast cancer tissue and its relationship to GSTP1 and COMT genotypes.","Matsui, Ikeda, Enomoto, Hosoda, Nakashima, Omae, Watanabe, Hibi, Kitajima","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10766427/," Reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced damage to DNA plays a major role in carcinogenesis . 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) was determined in DNA isolated from human breast tissue .

In order to estimate the level of oxidative damage and its role in breast cancer, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) was determined in DNA isolated from human breast tissue. Furthermore, we investigated whether polymorphisms in genes for enzymes involved in generation and elimination of ROS had any association with the level of 8-OHdG in breast tissue. In this study, the level of 8-OHdG in DNA was measured by the high performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detector (HPLC-ECD) method. Genotypes of cytochrome P450 (CYP)1A1, glutathione S-transferase (GST)M 1, GSTP1 and catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) were determined by PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. A total of 61 Japanese patients were included in the study. The mean level of 8-OHdG in DNA of breast cancer tissues was 2.07 +/- 0.95 per 10(5) dG residues, while the mean level of 8-OHdG in DNA of non-cancerous breast tissues was 1.34 +/- 0.46 per 10(5) dG residues. The 8-OHdG levels in DNA of breast cancer tissues were significantly higher than those of their corresponding non-cancerous breast tissues (P < 0.0001). There was negative correlation between the clinical stage and the mean level of 8-OHdG in DNA of breast cancer tissues. Furthermore, patients with genotype of high GSTP1 activity had lower level of 8-OHdG in DNA of breast cancer tissues than others. On the contrary, the mean level of 8-OHdG in DNA of breast cancer tissues was higher among patients with genotype of high COMT activity. Our findings support the assumption that cancer cells are more exposed to oxidative stress than adjacent non-cancerous tissue. Genetic polymorphisms in enzymes involved in ROS metabolism may have a role in individual susceptibility to oxidant-related breast disease. At the same time, reduction of oxidative stress is thought to be a very important measure for primary prevention of breast cancer."

The many molecular and cellular patho-mechanisms that have a role in RIHD are not completely understood. Endothelial injury, oxidative stress, and inflammation, as well as endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial damage, are considered the primary causes of RIHD. Ferroptosis is a newly discovered type of cell death that results from irondependent lipid peroxide accumulation. As ferroptosis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases, it seems that it has a significant effect on RIHD. It was recently shown that ionizing radiation (IR) generates severe ferroptosis, which is a critical component of Radiotherapy-mediated normal cell toxicity. These findings support the use of a ferroptosis inhibitor to reduce RIHD. In this perspective review, we summarize the role of ferroptosis in pathogens of cardiovascular disease and radiation toxicity, and we will introduce ferroptosis inhibitors as a new strategy to prevent or reduce RIHD."

Here, we identified an organosulfur compound named DATS isolated from garlic, that inhibits the expression of Trx-1 and the enzyme activity of Trx reductase in breast cancer cells. Tissue microarray of breast cancer patients and immunohistochemical method were used to analyze the role of Trx-1 in breast cancer metastasis. Spotaneous metastasis model and experimental metastasis model combined with HE staining, immunohistochemistry were used to verify in vivo anti-metastatic effect of DATS as well as its regulation on thioredoxin. Western blot, immunofluorescence, redox state assessment and detection of enzyme activity were employed to determine the effect of DATS on thioredoxin system. Trx-1 siRNA interference was used to investigate the conclusive evidence that Trx-1 was the target of DATS. In agreement with reduced Trx-1 nuclear translocation from cytoplasm by DATS, the production of reduced form of Trx-1 was dramatically decreased. Furthermore, in vivo, DATS administration was observed to significantly suppress spontaneous and experimental metastasis in nude mice. Delivery of DATS also resulted in decreased expression of Trx-1 as the direct target, as well as expression of NF-κB and MMP2/9 in primary tumor and lung tissue. Notably, the effects of DATS on the expression of downstream metastasis-associated genes were mediated by Trx-1, as demonstrated by the combination use of DATS and Trx-1 siRNA. Collectively, this present study indicates that targeting Trx system with DATS may provide a promising strategy for treating metastasis of TNBC."

Thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) is overexpressed in many cancer types and has been recognized as an anti-cancer target. The organoselenium compound ethaselen (BBSKE) has been proved to be a TrxR inhibitor and inhibit various types of tumor growth. However, whether BBSKE could inhibit tumor metastasis remains unclear. In this study, we aim to explore the antimetastatic effect of BBSKE and underlying mechanisms. BBSKE was found to dose-dependently suppress migration and invasion of MCF-7 and LoVo cells in vitro. The underlying mechanisms may include inhibition of TrxR activity, elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), decrease of EGFR activation and HER2 expression. Besides, the epithelial to mesenchymal transition process and expression of CD44, MMP-9, VEGFR2 and PD-L1 were also abrogated. Decreased migration and invasion, lower expression levels of EGFR, HER2, N-cadherin, CD44, MMP-9, VEGFR2 and PD-L1 were also observed in TrxR1-knockdown MCF-7 and LoVo cells. In the mouse breast cancer 4T1 model, BBSKE not only inhibited progression of primary tumor, but also suppressed formation of metastatic lung nodules and liver micro-metastases, indicating that BBSKE could effectively abolish tumor metastasis. In conclusion, our findings show that BBSKE is able to inhibit migration and invasion of cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, and may be used to prevent and treat metastasis."

PE proved to be beneficial in the context of breast and colon cancer.Glioblastoma has a dismal prognosis, with an average overall survival of about one year despite maximal safe resection, concomitant radiochemotherapy with temozolomide followed by adjuvant temozolomide therapy. Here, we focused on the influence of PE as an isolated and adjuvant treatment in murine GB therapy.PE did not reduce toxic side effects of chemotherapy in mice administered in a dose escalating scheme as shown before for starvation. Although regular treadmill training on its own had no obvious beneficial effects, its combination with temozolomide was beneficial in the treatment of glioblastoma-bearing mice. As PE might partly act through the induction of reactive oxygen species, dihydroartemisinin - an approved anti-malarial drug which induces oxidative stress in glioma cells - was further evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Dihydroartemisinin showed anti-glioma activity by promoting autophagy, reduced the clonogenic survival and proliferation capacity of glioma cells, and prolonged the survival of tumor bearing mice. Using the reactive oxygen species scavenger n-acetyl-cysteine these effects were in part reversible, suggesting that dihydroartemisinin partly acts through the generation of reactive oxygen species."

Progressive resistance versus relaxation training for breast cancer patients during adjuvant chemotherapy: design and rationale of a randomized controlled trial (BEATE study).,"Schmidt, Wiskemann, Krakowski-Roosen, Knicker, Habermann, Schneeweiss, Ulrich, Steindorf","Journal Article, Randomized Controlled Trial",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23103936/," Cancer-related fatigue is a common severe symptom in breast cancer patients, especially during chemotherapy . Resistance training as an accompanying treatment to chemotherapy has been minimally investigated, yet might counteract muscle degradation and inflammation caused by many chemotherapeutics .","Cancer-related fatigue is a common severe symptom in breast cancer patients, especially during chemotherapy. Exercise appears to be promising in prevention or treatment of fatigue. Resistance training as an accompanying treatment to chemotherapy has been minimally investigated, yet might counteract muscle degradation and inflammation caused by many chemotherapeutics, and thus forestall or reduce fatigue. Previous exercise trials mostly compared the intervention with 'usual care'. Therefore, it is unclear to what extent the observed effects on fatigue are based on physical adaptations by exercise itself, or rather on psycho-social factors linked to the group support or attention by the trainer. The BEATE study is a randomized, controlled intervention trial comparing a 12-week supervised progressive resistance training program with a supervised group-based progressive muscle relaxation training in 100 patients with breast cancer under adjuvant chemotherapy. The primary endpoint is cancer-related fatigue; secondary endpoints include quality of life, depression, and cognitive capacity. In addition, isokinetic and isometric muscle strength, cardiorespiratory fitness, and body composition are measured, and biomarkers, such as inflammatory parameters, cortisol, and oxidative stress are analyzed in blood, saliva and urine. Safety of the resistance training during chemotherapy is monitored. Strengths of the BEATE study include the investigation of progressive resistance training parallel with chemotherapy, the choice of a control group that enables an evaluation of the physiological effects of exercise beyond potential psycho-social effects, and the comprehensive and high-quality assessment of physiological factors and biomarkers potentially related to fatigue."

Oxidative stress was largely attenuated as observed through the decreased levels of DNA damage, protein 3-nitrotyrosine, macrophage infiltration, and NADPH oxidase .","MnTE-2-PyP(5+) is a potent catalytic scavenger of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, primarily superoxide and peroxynitrite. It therefore not only attenuates primary oxidative damage, but was found to modulate redox-based signaling pathways (HIF-1alpha, NF-kappaB, SP-1, and AP-1) and thus, in turn, secondary oxidative injury also. Cancer has been widely considered an oxidative stress condition. The goal of this study was to prove if and why a catalytic SOD mimic/peroxynitrite scavenger would exert anti-cancer effects, i.e., to evaluate whether the attenuation of the oxidative stress by MnTE-2-PyP(5+) could suppress tumor growth in a 4T1 mouse breast tumor model. Tumor cells were implanted into Balb/C mouse flanks. Three groups of mice (n=25) were studied: control (PBS) and 2 and 15 mg/kg/day of MnTE-2-PyP(5+) given subcutaneously twice daily starting when the tumors averaged 200 mm(3) (until they reached approximately 5-fold the initial volume). Intratumoral hypoxia (pimonidazole, carbonic anhydrase), HIF-1alpha, VEGF, proliferating capillary index (CD105), microvessel density (CD31), protein nitration, DNA oxidation (8-OHdG), NADPH oxidase (Nox-4), apoptosis (CD31), macrophage infiltration (CD68), and tumor drug levels were assessed. With 2 mg/kg/day a trend toward tumor growth delay was observed, and a significant trend was observed with 15 mg/kg/day. The 7.5-fold increase in drug dose was accompanied by a similar (6-fold) increase in tumor drug levels. Oxidative stress was largely attenuated as observed through the decreased levels of DNA damage, protein 3-nitrotyrosine, macrophage infiltration, and NADPH oxidase. Further, hypoxia was significantly decreased as were the levels of HIF-1alpha and VEGF. Consequently, suppression of angiogenesis was observed; both the microvessel density and the endothelial cell proliferation were markedly decreased. Our study indicates for the first time that MnTE-2-PyP(5+) has anti-cancer activity in its own right. The anti-cancer activity via HIF/VEGF pathways probably arises from the impact of the drug on the oxidative stress. Therefore, the catalytic scavenging of ROS/RNS by antioxidants, which in turn suppresses cellular transcriptional activity, could be an appropriate strategy for anti-cancer therapy. Enhancement of the anti-cancer effects may be achieved by optimizing the dosing regime, utilizing more bioavailable Mn porphyrins (MnP), and combining MnP treatment with irradiation, hyperthermia, and chemotherapy. Mn porphyrins may be advantageous compared to other anti-cancer drugs, owing to their radioprotection of normal tissue and the ability to afford pain management in cancer patients via prevention of chronic morphine tolerance."

The study was generally well-tolerated, and one (3.8%) required a dose reduction .","Pre-clinical and epidemiologic studies provide rationale for evaluating lipophilic statins for breast cancer prevention. We conducted a single-arm, biomarker modulation trial of lovastatin among women with increased risk of breast cancer. Eligibility criteria included a deleterious germline mutation in BRCA1, BRCA2, CDH1, or TP53; lifetime breast cancer risk of ≥20 % as estimated by the Claus model; or personal history of estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor-negative breast cancer. Participants received 40 mg of lovastatin orally twice daily for 6 months. We evaluated the following biomarkers before and after lovastatin use: breast duct cytology (primary endpoint), serum lipids, C-reactive protein, insulin-like growth factor-1, IGF binding protein-3, lipid peroxidation, oxidative DNA damage, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase genotype, and mammographic density. Thirty women were enrolled, and 26 (86.7 %) completed the study. For the primary endpoint of changes in breast duct cytology sampled by random periareolar fine needle aspiration, most participants [57.7 %, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 38.9-74.5 %] showed no change after lovastatin; 19.2 % (CI 8.1-38.3 %) had a favorable change in cytology, 7.7 % (95 % CI 1.0-25.3 %) had an unfavorable change, and 15.4 % (95 % CI 5.5-34.2 %) had equivocal results due to acellular specimens, usually after lovastatin. No significant changes were observed in secondary biomarker endpoints. The study was generally well-tolerated: 4 (13.3 %) participants did not complete the study, and one (3.8 %) required a dose reduction. This trial was technically feasible, but demonstrated no significant biomarker modulation; contributing factors may include insufficient sample size, drug dose and/or duration. The results are inconclusive and do not exclude a favorable effect on breast cancer risk."
Selenomethionine protects hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells against cobalt nanoparticles by stimulating antioxidant actions and DNA repair functions.,"Zhu, Liu, Zhang, Fan, Wang, Gu, Sun, Liu","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33875618/," Hematopoietic stem cells can differentiate into all blood lineages to maintain hematopoiesis, wound healing, and immune functions .

Recently, cobalt-chromium alloy casting implants have been used extensively in total hip replacements; however, cobalt nanoparticles (CoNPs) released from the alloy were toxic to HSCs and HPCs. We aimed to investigate the mechanism underlying the toxic effect of CoNPs on HSCs/HPCs and to determine the protective effect of selenomethionine (SeMet) against CoNPs <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Human and rat CD34+ HSCs/HPCs were isolated from cord blood and bone marrow, respectively. CoNPs decreased the viability of CD34+ HSCs/HPCs and increased apoptosis. SeMet attenuated the toxicity of CoNPs by enhancing the antioxidant ability of cells. The protective effect of SeMet was not completely abolished after adding H2O2 to abrogate the improvement of the antioxidant capacity by SeMet. SeMet and CoNPs stimulated ATM/ATR DNA damage response signals and inhibited cell proliferation. Unlike CoNPs, SeMet did not damage the DNA, and cell proliferation recovered after removing SeMet. SeMet inhibited the CoNP-induced upregulation of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α, thereby disrupting the inhibitory effect of HIF-1α on breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (BRCA1). Moreover, SeMet promoted BRCA1-mediated ubiquitination of cyclin B by upregulating UBE2K. Thus, SeMet enhanced cell cycle arrest and DNA repair post-CoNP exposure. Overall, SeMet protected CD34+ HSCs/HPCs against CoNPs by stimulating antioxidant activity and DNA repair."
"Prevention of doxorubicin-induced Cardiotoxicity by pharmacological non-hypoxic myocardial preconditioning based on Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) and carvedilol direct antioxidant effects: study protocol for a pilot, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial (CarDHA trial).","Carrasco, Ramirez, Nes, Schuster, Aguayo, Morales, Ramos, Hasson, Sotomayor, Henriquez, Cortés, Erazo, Salas, Gormaz","Journal Article, Randomized Controlled Trial",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32019575/," Anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity (AIC) has been associated with poor clinical outcomes .

Carvedilol, a β-blocker with unique antioxidant properties, emerged as a strategy to prevent AIC, but recent trials question its effectiveness. Some evidence suggests that the antioxidant, not the β-blocker effect, could prevent related cardiotoxicity. However, carvedilol's antioxidant effects are probably not enough to prevent cardiotoxicity manifestations in certain cases. We hypothesize that breast cancer patients taking carvedilol as well as a non-hypoxic myocardial preconditioning based on docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an enhancer of cardiac endogenous antioxidant capacity, will develop less subclinical cardiotoxicity manifestations than patients randomized to double placebo. We designed a pilot, randomized controlled, two-arm clinical trial with 32 patients to evaluate the effects of non-hypoxic cardiac preconditioning (DHA) plus carvedilol on subclinical cardiotoxicity in breast cancer patients undergoing anthracycline treatment. The trial includes four co-primary endpoints: changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) determined by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR); changes in global longitudinal strain (GLS) determined by two-dimensional echocardiography (ECHO); elevation in serum biomarkers (hs-cTnT and NT-ProBNP); and one electrocardiographic variable (QTc interval). Secondary endpoints include other imaging, biomarkers and the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events during follow-up. The enrollment and follow-up for clinical outcomes is ongoing. We expect a group of anthracycline-treated breast cancer patients exposed to carvedilol and non-hypoxic myocardial preconditioning with DHA to show less subclinical cardiotoxicity manifestations than a comparable group exposed to placebo.

Eighty female, chemotherapy-naïve breast cancer patients (median age 49, range 24-67 years) scheduled for four or five courses of adjuvant 3 weekly doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide (AC) chemotherapy, were randomly assigned to receive 80 mg PC-SOD (human recombinant SOD bound to lecithin) or placebo, administered intravenously (i.v.) immediately prior to each AC course. The primary end point was protection against cardiac damage evaluated using echocardiography, QT assessments and a set of biochemical markers for myocardial function, oxidative stress and inflammation. Assessments were performed before and during each course of chemotherapy, and at 1, 4 and 9 months after completion of the chemotherapy regimen. In all patients cardiac effects such as increases in NT-proBNP concentration and prolongation of the QTc interval were noticed. There were no differences between the PC-SOD and placebo-treated patients in systolic or diastolic cardiac function or for any other of the biomarkers used to assess the cardiac effects of anthracyclines. PC-SOD at a dose of 80 mg i.v. is not cardioprotective in patients with breast carcinoma treated with anthracyclines."

BRCA1/2 genes are involved in DNA double-strand break repair, DNA alterations that can be caused by exposure to reactive oxygen . Mitochondrial genome variations affect electron transport chain efficiency .","Individuals carrying pathogenic mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes have a high lifetime risk of breast cancer. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are involved in DNA double-strand break repair, DNA alterations that can be caused by exposure to reactive oxygen species, a main source of which are mitochondria. Mitochondrial genome variations affect electron transport chain efficiency and reactive oxygen species production. Individuals with different mitochondrial haplogroups differ in their metabolism and sensitivity to oxidative stress. Variability in mitochondrial genetic background can alter reactive oxygen species production, leading to cancer risk. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that mitochondrial haplogroups modify breast cancer risk in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. We genotyped 22,214 (11,421 affected, 10,793 unaffected) mutation carriers belonging to the Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1/2 for 129 mitochondrial polymorphisms using the iCOGS array. Haplogroup inference and association detection were performed using a phylogenetic approach. ALTree was applied to explore the reference mitochondrial evolutionary tree and detect subclades enriched in affected or unaffected individuals. We discovered that subclade T1a1 was depleted in affected BRCA2 mutation carriers compared with the rest of clade T (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.55; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.34 to 0.88; P = 0.01). Compared with the most frequent haplogroup in the general population (that is, H and T clades), the T1a1 haplogroup has a HR of 0.62 (95% CI, 0.40 to 0.95; P = 0.03). We also identified three potential susceptibility loci, including G13708A/rs28359178, which has demonstrated an inverse association with familial breast cancer risk. This study illustrates how original approaches such as the phylogeny-based method we used can empower classical molecular epidemiological studies aimed at identifying association or risk modification effects."
Schisandrin B prevents doxorubicin-induced chronic cardiotoxicity and enhances its anticancer activity in vivo.,"Xu, Liu, Sun, Pan, Sun, Yan, Hu","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22164272/," Schisandrin B (Sch B) could protect against doxorubicin (Dox)-induced acute cardiotoxicity via enhancing cardiomyocytic glutathione redox cycling . Sch B is the only molecule ever proved to function as a cardioprotective agent as well as a chemotherapeutic sensitizer, potentially applicable for cancer treatment .","To mitigate the cardiotoxicity of anthracycline antibiotics without compromising their anticancer activities is still an issue to be solved. We previously demonstrated that schisandrin B (Sch B) could protect against doxorubicin (Dox)-induced acute cardiotoxicity via enhancing cardiomyocytic glutathione redox cycling that could attenuate oxidative stress generated from Dox. In this study, we attempted to prove if Sch B could also protect against Dox-induced chronic cardiotoxicity, a more clinically relevant issue, without compromising its anticancer activity. Rat was given intragastrically either vehicle or Sch B (50 mg/kg) two hours prior to i.p. Dox (2.5 mg/kg) weekly over a 5-week period with a cumulative dose of Dox 12.5 mg/kg. At the 6th and 12th week after last dosing, rats were subjected to cardiac function measurement, and left ventricles were processed for histological and ultrastructural examination. Dox anticancer activity enhanced by Sch B was evaluated by growth inhibition of 4T1, a breast cancer cell line, and S180, a sarcoma cell line, in vitro and in vivo. Pretreatment with Sch B significantly attenuated Dox-induced loss of cardiac function and damage of cardiomyocytic structure. Sch B substantially enhanced Dox cytotoxicities toward S180 in vitro and in vivo in mice, and increased Dox cytotoxcity against 4T1 in vitro. Although we did not observe this enhancement against the implanted 4T1 primary tumor, the spontaneous metastasis to lung was significantly reduced in combined treatment group than Dox alone group. Sch B is capable of protecting Dox-induced chronic cardiotoxicity and enhancing its anticancer activity. To the best of our knowledge, Sch B is the only molecule ever proved to function as a cardioprotective agent as well as a chemotherapeutic sensitizer, which is potentially applicable for cancer treatment."

Heart failure that is caused by adriamycin-treatment induced cardiac fibrosis is a major cause of death in patients who are treated with this medication. The severe oxidative stress that is induced by adriamycin is considered to be one of the primary mechanisms by which fibrogenesis of cardiac tissue occurs. In the present study, we demonstrate that 3,3'-diindolymethane (DIM) exhibits a significant anti-fibrosis effect on cardiac tissue in an animal model of adriamycin-induced cardiac fibrosis (AICF). Further studies demonstrated that DIM is able to dramatically up-regulate the expression of breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (BRCA1) in cardiac tissue and fibroblast, which subsequently activate the transcription factor Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2). The upregulation of this transcription factor resulted in the expression of several anti-oxidant genes in the cell. Because DIM is a safe food additive that has been used for decades, our findings suggest that there is a great potential for this chemical to be developed into a clinical medication for the treatment of adriamycin-induced heart failure during cancer therapy."

In this study we report the effects of N-[2-(2-methoxy-6H-dipyrido{2,3-a:3,2-e}pyrrolizin-11-yl)ethyl]-2-furamide (NMDPEF), a melatonin-related inhibitor of quinone oxidoreductase2 (QR2) on the toxicity of PQ in vitro & in vivo. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Prevention of PQ-induced toxicity was tested in different cells, including primary pneumocytes and astroglial U373 cells. Cell death and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were analysed by flow cytometry and fluorescent probes. QR2 silencing was achieved by lentiviral shRNAs. PQ (30 mg·kg(-1)) and NMDPEF were administered i.p. to Wistar rats and animals were monitored for 28 days. PQ toxicity in the substantia nigra (SN) was tested by a localized microinfusion and electrocorticography. QR2 activity was measured by fluorimetry of N-benzyldihydronicotinamide oxidation. KEY RESULTS NMDPEF potently antagonized non-apoptotic PQ-induced cell death, ROS generation and inhibited cellular QR2 activity. In contrast, the cytoprotective effect of melatonin and apocynin was limited and transient compared with NMDPEF. Silencing of QR2 attenuated PQ-induced cell death and reduced the efficacy of NMDPEF. Significantly, NMDPEF (4.5 mg·kg(-1)) potently antagonized PQ-induced systemic toxicity and animal mortality. Microinfusion of NMDPEF into SN prevented severe behavioural and electrocortical effects of PQ which correlated with inhibition of malondialdehyde accumulation in cells and tissues. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS NMDPEF protected against PQ-induced toxicity in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a key role for QR2 in the regulation of oxidative stress."

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of MFGM on a rat model of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and its potential mechanism of action. Sixty-two newborn Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into 4 experimental groups: Breast-fed normal, formula fed (FF), FF + 6 g/L MFGM, and FF + 12 g/L MFGM. The FF rats and the FF rats supplemented with MFGM were exposed to asphyxia/cold stress to induce NEC. Body weight, histological score, survival time, oxidative stress injury, enterocyte proliferation/apoptosis, and inflammatory response were assessed. Meanwhile, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated IEC-6 enterocytes were used as a model to test the anti-inflammatory effects of MFGM. Supplementation with 12 g/L MFGM alleviated body weight loss, reduced the incidence of NEC, increased the survival rate, and attenuated the severity of bowel damage in the NEC rat model. Furthermore, 12 g/L MFGM administration inhibited the protein expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in the animal model. In IEC-6 enterocytes, the upregulation of TLR4, myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), phosphorylated nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65 subunit, and the nuclear translocation of NF-κBp65 induced by LPS was partially inhibited by MFGM pretreatment. Our findings suggested that MFGM has beneficial effects on neonatal rats with NEC by suppressing inflammation via the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway."

In lung cancer, hMTH protein may be a potential marker for the detection of persistent oxidative stress in lung cancer .","In situ, oxidation of deoxyguanosine yields 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG), which is mutation prone and results in a G:C --> T:A transversion following DNA replication. Another pathway to the formation of DNA containing 8-oxo-dG is by the misincorporation of 8-oxo-dGTP via DNA polymerase. Human MutT homologue (hMTH1), an 8-oxo-dGTPase, prevents misincorporation of this oxidized nucleotide by hydrolyzing 8-oxo-dGTP to 8-oxo-dGMP. Previous studies have shown that hMTH1 mRNA is overexpressed in human renal cell carcinomas and breast tumors. Elevated levels of hMTH1 protein have also been detected in brain tumors. In the current study, we determined whether hMTH1 protein is overexpressed in primary non-small-cell lung carcinomas as compared to adjacent histologically normal lung tissue. Twenty matched human lung tumor/normal pairs were examined by Western analysis for expression of hMTH1 protein. Overexpression in the tumors was detected in 4/8 (50%) adenocarcinomas, 4/4 (100%) adenocarcinomas with bronchioalveolar (BAC) features, 2/2 (100%) BACs, and 3/6 (50%) squamous cell carcinomas. The data from Western analysis were validated by immunohistochemical staining for hMTH1 protein. The results of this study indicate that hMTH1 protein may be a potential marker for the detection of persistent oxidative stress in lung cancer."
