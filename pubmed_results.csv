"Breast Cancer: Risk Assessment, Screening, and Primary Prevention.","Michaels, Worthington, Rusiecki","Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36759097/,"This review provides an outline of a risk-based approach to breast cancer screening and prevention. All women should be assessed for breast cancer risk starting at age 18. Patients can then be stratified into average, moderate, and high-risk groups. Counseling on breast awareness and lifestyle changes is recommended for all women.","This review provides an outline of a risk-based approach to breast cancer screening and prevention. All women should be assessed for breast cancer risk starting at age 18 with identification of modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors. Patients can then be stratified into average, moderate, and high-risk groups with personalized screening and prevention plans. Counseling on breast awareness and lifestyle changes is recommended for all women, regardless of risk category. High-risk individuals may benefit from additional screening modalities such as MRI and chemoprevention and should be managed closely by a multidisciplinary team."
Breast cancer.,"Veronesi, Boyle, Goldhirsch, Orecchia, Viale","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15894099/,"Mammography and ultrasonography are still the most effective for women with non-dense and dense breast tissues. MRI, lymphatic mapping, the nipple-sparing mastectomy, partial breast irradiation, neoadjuvant systemic therapy, and adjuvant treatments are promising for subgroups of breast-cancer patients.","Breast cancer remains a public-health issue on a global scale. We report new information about the disease from the past 5 years. Early age at first birth, increasing parity, and tamoxifen use are related to long-term lifetime reduction in breast-cancer risk. Ductal carcinomas in situ has been suggested to be renamed ductal intraepithelial neoplasia to emphasise its non-life-threatening nature. An alternative approach, the progenitor/stem cell theory, predicts that only some tumour cells cause cancer progression and that these should be targeted by treatment. Mammography and ultrasonography are still the most effective for women with non-dense and dense breast tissues, respectively. Additionally, MRI, lymphatic mapping, the nipple-sparing mastectomy, partial breast irradiation, neoadjuvant systemic therapy, and adjuvant treatments are promising for subgroups of breast-cancer patients. Although tamoxifen can be offered for endocrine-responsive disease, aromatase inhibitors are increasingly used. Assessment of potential molecular targets is now important in primary diagnosis. Tyrosine-kinase inhibitors and other drugs with anti-angiogenesis properties are currently undergoing preclinical investigations."
Endocrine Therapy for Primary and Secondary Prevention After Diagnosis of High-Risk Breast Lesions or Preinvasive Breast Cancer.,"Laws, Punglia","Review, Journal Article",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37126767/,"Patients with high-risk breast lesions (HRLs) or preinvasive breast cancers face an elevated risk of future breast cancer diagnoses. Endocrine therapy in this setting reduces the risk of a future diagnosis but does not confer improved survival. For patients with HRLs, available chemoprevention regimens differ by menopausal status.","<i>The Oncology Grand Rounds series is designed to place original reports published in the</i> Journal <i>into clinical context. A case presentation is followed by a description of diagnostic and management challenges, a review of the relevant literature, and a summary of the authors' suggested management approaches. The goal of this series is to help readers better understand how to apply the results of key studies, including those published in</i> Journal of Clinical Oncology<i>, to patients seen in their own clinical practice.</i>Patients with high-risk breast lesions (HRLs) or preinvasive breast cancers face an elevated risk of future breast cancer diagnoses. Endocrine therapy in this setting reduces the risk of a future diagnosis but does not confer improved survival, thus the side effects of primary/secondary prevention must be considered relative to the benefits. Here, we discuss the available chemoprevention regimens for patients with HRLs and considerations for selecting a regimen, as well as the decision making surrounding use of adjuvant endocrine therapy for patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). For patients with HRLs, available chemoprevention regimens differ by menopausal status, including tamoxifen 20 mg once daily for 5 years and more recently tamoxifen 5 mg once daily for 3 years in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women as well as raloxifene or aromatase inhibitors for postmenopausal women. We recommend a shared decision-making approach with attention to patient preferences related to risk tolerance and side-effect profiles. Low-dose tamoxifen appears to be a particularly favorable choice that is well tolerated, without risk of serious adverse events and offers comparable risk reduction to other regimens. For DCIS, the benefit of endocrine therapy in addition to radiation is small, and appears to be driven mainly by a reduction in contralateral breast diagnoses or new breast cancers. A strategy that reduces the side-effect profile of chemoprevention such as low-dose tamoxifen may be especially appealing in the setting of secondary prevention."
Risk-reducing mastectomy for the prevention of primary breast cancer.,"Carbine, Lostumbo, Wallace, Ko","Journal Article, Meta-Analysis, Review, Systematic Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29620792/,"This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2004 and previously updated in 2006 and 2010. The studies presented data on 15,077 women with a wide range of risk factors for breast cancer, who underwent RRM. Twenty-one BRRM studies looking at the incidence of breast cancer or disease-specific mortality, or both, reported reductions after BRRM.","Recent progress in understanding the genetic basis of breast cancer and widely publicized reports of celebrities undergoing risk-reducing mastectomy (RRM) have increased interest in RRM as a method of preventing breast cancer. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2004 and previously updated in 2006 and 2010. (i) To determine whether risk-reducing mastectomy reduces death rates from any cause in women who have never had breast cancer and in women who have a history of breast cancer in one breast, and (ii) to examine the effect of risk-reducing mastectomy on other endpoints, including breast cancer incidence, breast cancer mortality, disease-free survival, physical morbidity, and psychosocial outcomes. For this Review update, we searched Cochrane Breast Cancer's Specialized Register, MEDLINE, Embase and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) on 9 July 2016. We included studies in English. Participants included women at risk for breast cancer in at least one breast. Interventions included all types of mastectomy performed for the purpose of preventing breast cancer. At least two review authors independently abstracted data from each report. We summarized data descriptively; quantitative meta-analysis was not feasible due to heterogeneity of study designs and insufficient reporting. We analyzed data separately for bilateral risk-reducing mastectomy (BRRM) and contralateral risk-reducing mastectomy (CRRM). Four review authors assessed the methodological quality to determine whether or not the methods used sufficiently minimized selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, and attrition bias. All 61 included studies were observational studies with some methodological limitations; randomized trials were absent. The studies presented data on 15,077 women with a wide range of risk factors for breast cancer, who underwent RRM.Twenty-one BRRM studies looking at the incidence of breast cancer or disease-specific mortality, or both, reported reductions after BRRM, particularly for those women with BRCA1/2 mutations. Twenty-six CRRM studies consistently reported reductions in incidence of contralateral breast cancer but were inconsistent about improvements in disease-specific survival. Seven studies attempted to control for multiple differences between intervention groups and showed no overall survival advantage for CRRM. Another study showed significantly improved survival following CRRM, but after adjusting for bilateral risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (BRRSO), the CRRM effect on all-cause mortality was no longer significant.Twenty studies assessed psychosocial measures; most reported high levels of satisfaction with the decision to have RRM but greater variation in satisfaction with cosmetic results. Worry over breast cancer was significantly reduced after BRRM when compared both to baseline worry levels and to the groups who opted for surveillance rather than BRRM, but there was diminished satisfaction with body image and sexual feelings.Seventeen case series reporting on adverse events from RRM with or without reconstruction reported rates of unanticipated reoperations from 4% in those without reconstruction to 64% in participants with reconstruction.In women who have had cancer in one breast, removing the other breast may reduce the incidence of cancer in that other breast, but there is insufficient evidence that this improves survival because of the continuing risk of recurrence or metastases from the original cancer. Additionally, thought should be given to other options to reduce breast cancer risk, such as BRRSO and chemoprevention, when considering RRM. While published observational studies demonstrated that BRRM was effective in reducing both the incidence of, and death from, breast cancer, more rigorous prospective studies are suggested. BRRM should be considered only among those at high risk of disease, for example, BRCA1/2 carriers. CRRM was shown to reduce the incidence of contralateral breast cancer, but there is insufficient evidence that CRRM improves survival, and studies that control for multiple confounding variables are recommended. It is possible that selection bias in terms of healthier, younger women being recommended for or choosing CRRM produces better overall survival numbers for CRRM. Given the number of women who may be over-treated with BRRM/CRRM, it is critical that women and clinicians understand the true risk for each individual woman before considering surgery. Additionally, thought should be given to other options to reduce breast cancer risk, such as BRRSO and chemoprevention when considering RRM."
Pectin: A Bioactive Food Polysaccharide with Cancer Preventive Potential.,"Emran, Islam, Mitra, Paul, Nath, Khan, Das, Chandran, Sharma, Lima, Awadh, Almazni, Alhasaniah, Guiné","Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36364232/,Pectin is an acidic heteropolysaccharide found in the cell walls and the primary and middle lamella of land plants. It is commonly used in the food industry to gel or thicken foods and to stabilize acid-based milk beverages. Colon and breast cancer are among the diseases for which data suggest that modified pectin has beneficial effects.,"Pectin is an acidic heteropolysaccharide found in the cell walls and the primary and middle lamella of land plants. To be authorized as a food additive, industrial pectins must meet strict guidelines set forth by the Food and Agricultural Organization and must contain at least 65% polygalacturonic acid to achieve the E440 level. Fruit pectin derived from oranges or apples is commonly used in the food industry to gel or thicken foods and to stabilize acid-based milk beverages. It is a naturally occurring component and can be ingested by dietary consumption of fruit and vegetables. Preventing long-term chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease is an important role of dietary carbohydrates. Colon and breast cancer are among the diseases for which data suggest that modified pectin (MP), specifically modified citrus pectin (MCP), has beneficial effects on the development and spread of malignancies, in addition to its benefits as a soluble dietary fiber. Cellular and animal studies and human clinical trials have provided corroborating data. Although pectin has many diverse functional qualities, this review focuses on various modifications used to develop MP and its benefits for cancer prevention, bioavailability, clinical trials, and toxicity studies. This review concludes that pectin has anti-cancer characteristics that have been found to inhibit tumor development and proliferation in a wide variety of cancer cells. Nevertheless, further clinical and basic research is required to confirm the chemopreventive or therapeutic role of specific dietary carbohydrate molecules."
<i>BRCA</i> Mutations and Breast Cancer Prevention.,Kotsopoulos,"Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30572612/,The gold standard for the primary prevention of breast cancer remains bilateral mastectomy.

Although annual screening with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and mammography promotes the earlier detection of the disease, the gold standard for the primary prevention of breast cancer remains bilateral mastectomy. In the current paper, I review the evidence regarding the management of healthy <i>BRCA</i> mutation carriers, including key risk factors and protective factors, and also discuss potential chemoprevention options. I also provide an overview of the key findings from the literature published to date, with a focus on data from studies that are well-powered, and preferably prospective in nature."
Breast Cancer Prevention: Current Approaches and Future Directions.,Sauter,"Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29774312/,"The breast is the most common site among women worldwide of noncutaneous cancer. Many clinical and genetic factors have been found to increase a woman's risk of developing the disease. Chemoprevention medications are available for those at high risk, though they are underutilized in eligible women.","The topic of breast cancer prevention is very broad. All aspects of the topic, therefore, cannot be adequately covered in a single review. The objective of this review is to discuss strategies in current use to prevent breast cancer, as well as potential approaches that could be used in the future. This review does not discuss early detection strategies for breast cancer, including breast cancer screening. The breast is the most common site among women worldwide of noncutaneous cancer. Many clinical and genetic factors have been found to increase a woman's risk of developing the disease. Current strategies to decrease a woman's risk of developing breast cancer include primary prevention, such as avoiding tobacco, exogenous hormone use and excess exposure to ionizing radiation, maintaining a normal weight, exercise, breastfeeding, eating a healthy diet and minimizing alcohol intake. Chemoprevention medications are available for those at high risk, though they are underutilized in eligible women. Mastectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy are reasonable strategies for women who have deleterious mutations in genes that dramatically increase the risk of developing cancer in either breast. There are a variety of strategies in development for the prevention of breast cancer. Personalized approaches to prevent breast cancer that are being developed focus on advances in precision medicine, knowledge of the immune system and the tumor microenvironment and their role in cancer development. Advances in our understanding of how breast cancer develops are allowing investigators to specifically target populations who are most likely to benefit. Additionally, prevention clinical trials are starting to evaluate multi-agent cancer prevention approaches, with the hope of improved efficacy over single agents. Finally, there is a push to increase the use of chemopreventive agents with proven efficacy, such as tamoxifen and raloxifene, in the prevention of breast cancer."
An Overview of Cancer Prevention: Chemoprevention and Immunoprevention.,"Gu, Li","Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33033707/,Cancer prevention encompasses a broad spectrum of strategies designed to lower the chance of developing cancer and reduce the morbidity of established cancer. Eliminating or mitigating cancer risk factors by adopting healthy behaviors and lifestyles is the easiest and most effective way of preventing cancer. Secondary prevention includes screening to identify precancerous lesions and taking intervention measures to prevent disease progression to malignancy.,"Cancer prevention encompasses a broad spectrum of strategies designed to lower the chance of developing cancer and reduce the morbidity of established cancer. There are three levels of cancer prevention. Eliminating or mitigating cancer risk factors by adopting healthy behaviors and lifestyles, such as avoiding tobacco and alcohol use, exercising, eating a healthy diet, and applying sunscreen to protect against UV exposure, belongs to primary prevention and is the easiest and most effective way of preventing cancer for the general public. Secondary prevention includes screening to identify precancerous lesions and taking intervention measures to prevent disease progression to malignancy. Tertiary prevention refers to reducing or controlling the symptoms and morbidity of established cancer or the morbidity caused by cancer therapy. For high-risk populations, chemopreventive agents, such as selective estrogen receptor modulators (including tamoxifan and raloxifene) in breast cancer prevention and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (aspirin) in colorectal cancer prevention, and immunoprevention using human papillomavirus and hepatitis B virus vaccines in infection-related cancers have shown clear clinical benefits of reducing cancer incidences. In this review, we will summarize the current status of cancer prevention, focusing on the major agents that are clinically used for chemoprevention and immunoprevention."
Identifying actionable druggable targets for breast cancer: Mendelian randomization and population-based analyses.,"Zhang, Li, Sundquist, Sundquist, Ji",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38251461/,"We identified genetic instruments for 1406 actionable targets of approved non-oncological drugs based on gene expression, DNA methylation, and protein expression quantitative trait loci. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics were obtained from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (122,977 cases, 105,974 controls) Results from the nested case-control study showed that the use of raloxifene (targeting MAPT) was associated with 35% reduced breast cancer risk.","Drug repurposing provides a cost-effective approach to address the need for breast cancer prevention and therapeutics. We aimed to identify actionable druggable targets using Mendelian randomization (MR) and then validate the candidate drugs using population-based analyses. We identified genetic instruments for 1406 actionable targets of approved non-oncological drugs based on gene expression, DNA methylation, and protein expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL, mQTL, and pQTL, respectively). Genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics were obtained from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (122,977 cases, 105,974 controls). We further conducted a nested case-control study using data retrieved from Swedish registers to validate the candidate drugs that were identified from MR analyses. We identified six significant MR associations with gene expression levels (TUBB, MDM2, CSK, ULK3, MC1R and KCNN4) and two significant associations with gene methylation levels across 21 CpG islands (RPS23 and MAPT). Results from the nested case-control study showed that the use of raloxifene (targeting MAPT) was associated with 35% reduced breast cancer risk (odds ratio, OR, 0.65; 95% confidence interval, CI, 0.51-0.83). However, usage of estradiol, tolterodine, and nitrofurantoin (also targeting MAPT) was associated with increased breast cancer risk, with adjusted ORs and 95% CI of 1.10 (1.07-1.13), 1.16 (1.09-1.24), and 1.09 (1.05-1.13), respectively. The effect of raloxifene and nitrofurantoin lost significance in further validation analyses using active-comparator and new-user design. This large-scale MR analysis, combined with population-based validation, identified eight druggable target genes for breast cancer and suggested that raloxifene is an effective chemoprevention against breast cancer.

Tamoxifen and the risk of breast cancer in women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation.,"Kotsopoulos, Gronwald, Huzarski, Aeilts, Randall Armel, Karlan, Singer, Eisen, Tung, Olopade, Bordeleau, Eng, Foulkes, Neuhausen, Cullinane, Pal, Fruscio, Lubinski, Metcalfe, Sun, Narod, ",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37432545/,Tamoxifen has not been assessed as a primary prevention agent in women with an inherited BRCA mutation. Chemoprevention with a selective estrogen receptor modulator is a non-surgical option offered to high-risk women.,"Chemoprevention with a selective estrogen receptor modulator (tamoxifen or raloxifene) is a non-surgical option offered to high-risk women to reduce the risk of breast cancer. The evidence for tamoxifen benefit is based on trials conducted among predominantly postmenopausal women from the general population and on studies of contralateral breast cancer in women with a pathogenic variant (mutation hereafter) in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Tamoxifen has not been assessed as a primary prevention agent in women with an inherited BRCA mutation. We conducted a prospective analysis of tamoxifen chemoprevention and the risk of breast cancer in women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. Data on tamoxifen (and raloxifene) use was collected by questionnaire and updated biennially. Information on incident cancers was collected by self-report and was confirmed by medical record review. In a matched analysis, we estimated the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for developing a first primary breast cancer associated with tamoxifen or raloxifene use, using Cox proportional hazards analysis. There were 4578 unaffected women in the cohort, of whom 137 reported tamoxifen use (3%), 83 reported raloxifene use (2%) and 12 used both drugs (0.3%). Women who used tamoxifen or raloxifene were matched 1:3 with women who used neither drug on year of birth, country of residence, year of study entry and gene (BRCA1 or BRCA2). We generated 202 matched pairs. After a mean follow-up of 6.8 years, there were 22 incident breast cancers diagnosed among tamoxifen/raloxifene users (10.9% of users) and 71 cases diagnosed among non-users (14.3% of non-users; HR = 0.64; 95% CI 0.40-1.03; P = 0.07). Chemoprevention may be an effective risk-reduction option for BRCA mutation carriers, but further studies with longer follow-up are necessary."
Breast Cancer Chemoprevention: Use and Views of Australian Women and Their Clinicians.,"Macdonald, Saunders, Keogh, Hunter, Mazza, McLachlan, Jones, Nesci, Friedlander, Hopper, Emery, Hickey, Milne, Phillips, ","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33115784/,"Study examined barriers and facilitators to chemoprevention use for Australian women at increased risk of breast cancer, and their clinicians. For women, the strongest barriers were side effects (31%) and inadequate information (23%) Strongest facilitators related to tamoxifen's long-term efficacy (35%) and staying healthy for family (13%)","Guidelines endorse the use of chemoprevention for breast cancer risk reduction. This study examined the barriers and facilitators to chemoprevention use for Australian women at increased risk of breast cancer, and their clinicians. Surveys, based on the Theoretical Domains Framework, were mailed to 1,113 women at ≥16% lifetime risk of breast cancer who were enrolled in the Kathleen Cuningham Foundation Consortium for Research into Familial Breast Cancer cohort study (kConFab), and their 524 treating clinicians. Seven hundred twenty-five women (65%) and 221 (42%) clinicians responded. Only 10 (1.4%) kConFab women had ever taken chemoprevention. Three hundred seventy-eight (52%) kConFab women, two (3%) breast surgeons, and 51 (35%) family physicians were not aware of chemoprevention. For women, the strongest barriers to chemoprevention were side effects (31%) and inadequate information (23%), which operate in the Theoretical Domains Framework domains of ""beliefs about consequences"" and ""knowledge,"" respectively. Strongest facilitators related to tamoxifen's long-term efficacy (35%, ""knowledge,"" ""beliefs about consequences,"" and ""goals"" domains), staying healthy for family (13%, ""social role"" and ""goals"" domains), and abnormal breast biopsy (13%, ""environmental context"" domain). The strongest barrier for family physicians was insufficient knowledge (45%, ""knowledge"" domain) and for breast surgeons was medication side effects (40%, ""beliefs about consequences"" domain). The strongest facilitators for both clinician groups related to clear guidelines, strong family history, and better tools to select patients (""environmental context and resources"" domain). Clinician knowledge and resources, and beliefs about the side-effect consequences of chemoprevention, are key domains that could be targeted to potentially enhance uptake. PREVENTION RELEVANCE: Despite its efficacy in reducing breast cancer incidence, chemoprevention is underutilised. This survey study of Australian women and their clinicians used behavioural change theory to identify modifiable barriers to chemoprevention uptake, and to suggest interventions such as policy change, educational resources and public campaigns, that may increase awareness and use.<i>See related Spotlight by Vogel, p. 1</i>."
Chemoprevention and Lifestyle Modifications for Risk Reduction in Sporadic and Hereditary Breast Cancer.,"Manna, Serrano, Aurilio, Bonanni, Lazzeroni","Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37628558/,"Female breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy worldwide.

For healthy women carrying BRCA 1 or BRCa 2 pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) germline variants, the efficacy of chemopreventions is still controversial.","Female breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy worldwide. Risk assessment helps to identify women at increased risk of breast cancer and allows the adoption of a comprehensive approach to reducing breast cancer incidence through personalized interventions, including lifestyle modification, chemoprevention, intensified surveillance with breast imaging, genetic counseling, and testing. Primary prevention means acting on modifiable risk factors to reduce breast cancer occurrence. Chemoprevention with tamoxifen, raloxifene, anastrozole, and exemestane has already shown benefits in decreasing breast cancer incidence in women at an increased risk for breast cancer. For healthy women carrying BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) germline variants, the efficacy of chemoprevention is still controversial. Adopting chemoprevention strategies and the choice among agents should depend on the safety profile and risk-benefit ratio. Unfortunately, the uptake of these agents has been low. Lifestyle modifications can reduce breast cancer incidence, and the recommendations for BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 P/LP germline variant carriers are comparable to the general population. This review summarizes the most recent evidence regarding the efficacy of chemoprevention and lifestyle interventions in women with sporadic and hereditary breast cancer."
Breast cancer chemoprevention: An update on current practice and opportunities for primary care physicians.,"Ball, Arevalo, Juarez, Payne, Jones","Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31494144/,"Chemoprevention through hormonal therapy is an effective way to reduce the incidence of breast cancer in women with high risk. Selective estrogen receptor modulators, tamoxifen and raloxifene, are approved for this indication by the United States Food and Drug Administration.","Several risk assessment models have been validated for the estimation of risk of breast cancer in women. Chemoprevention through hormonal therapy is an effective way to reduce the incidence of breast cancer in women with high risk. Selective estrogen receptor modulators, tamoxifen and raloxifene, are approved for this indication by the United States Food and Drug Administration, and aromatase inhibitors have also shown promise in recent studies. These medications are generally well tolerated, except for reported increased rates of fractures and venous thromboembolic events. Despite strong recommendations from several regulatory bodies, advocacy for chemoprevention has been inadequate in practice, more so among the primary care physicians. Studies have identified several barriers in physicians, patients, and the system, contributing to this problem. Lack of knowledge about risk assessment models and chemoprevention options preclude physicians from prescribing these medications with confidence. Fear of potential adverse events, confusion regarding the purpose of the therapy, and need for continued adherence for five years are among the principal reasons for reduced chemoprevention uptake and early discontinuation among patients. Multifaceted interventions directed at education and training of health care professionals, proper counseling of women at high risk, and promotion of the development of improved medications might help ensure better chemoprevention uptake in the target population."

Metformin and Chemoprevention: Potential for Heart-Healthy Targeting of Biologically Aggressive Breast Cancer.,"Jones, Dietze, Jovanovic-Talisman, McCune, Seewaldt","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33194937/,"There is a search for well-tolerated prevention agents that can simultaneously reduce risk of breast cancers, cardiovascular disease, and type-2 diabetes. tamoxifen is the only drug approved for reduction of breast cancer risk in premenopausal women.","Currently, tamoxifen is the only drug approved for reduction of breast cancer risk in premenopausal women. The significant cardiovascular side effects of tamoxifen, coupled with lack of a survival benefit, potential for genotoxicity, and failure to provide a significant risk-reduction for estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer, all contribute to the low acceptance of tamoxifen chemoprevention in premenopausal women at high-risk for breast cancer. While other prevention options exist for postmenopausal women, there is a search for well-tolerated prevention agents that can simultaneously reduce risk of breast cancers, cardiovascular disease, and type-2 diabetes. Metformin is a well-tolerated oral biguanide hypoglycemic agent that is prescribed worldwide to over 120 million individuals with type-2 diabetes. Metformin is inexpensive, safe during pregnancy, and the combination of metformin, healthy lifestyle, and exercise has been shown to be effective in preventing diabetes. There is a growing awareness that prevention drugs and interventions should make the ""whole woman healthy."" To this end, current efforts have focused on finding low toxicity alternatives, particularly repurposed drugs for chemoprevention of breast cancer, including metformin. Metformin's mechanisms of actions are complex but clearly involve secondary lowering of circulating insulin. Signaling pathways activated by insulin also drive biologically aggressive breast cancer and predict poor survival in women with breast cancer. The mechanistic rationale for metformin chemoprevention is well-supported by the scientific literature. Metformin is cheap, safe during pregnancy, and has the potential to provide heart-healthy breast cancer prevention. On-going primary and secondary prevention trials will provide evidence whether metformin is effective in preventing breast cancer."
Breast Cancer Chemoprevention: A Practical Guide for the Primary Care Provider.,"Farkas, Vanderberg, Merriam, DiNardo",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31560601/,Several organizations recommend incorporating chemoprevention into routine well-woman care. Primary care providers report discomfort with and a lack of medical knowledge on this topic. We advocate a stepwise approach consisting of risk assessment and communication. We encourage providers to identify high-risk women and refer them to genetic counseling.,"Several organizations, including the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, and the United States Preventive Services Task Force, recommend incorporation of breast cancer risk-based counseling and chemoprevention into routine well-woman care. However, primary care providers report both discomfort with and a lack of medical knowledge on this topic. In this review we present a practical, evidence-based guide for incorporating breast cancer risk assessment and chemoprevention into routine care. We advocate a stepwise approach consisting of: (1) risk assessment and communication, (2) selection of appropriate chemoprevention based on risk-benefit analysis, (3) shared decision-making regarding chemoprevention, and (4) management of chemoprevention side effects. We encourage providers to identify high-risk women and refer them to genetic counseling or a high-risk breast cancer clinic. For women who are not considered high risk, we suggest using the Gail model to estimate a woman's 5-year risk of invasive breast cancer. Usually, the benefits of chemoprevention outweigh the risks of chemoprevention once a woman's 5-year risk of invasive breast cancer reaches 3%. For these women there are several factors that need to be considered when selecting a chemoprevention agent, including patient preference, thrombotic history, menopausal status, absence or presence of a uterus, and bone mineral density. We advocate an evidence-based shared decision-making approach that reflects the woman's individual preferences when communicating risk and counseling about chemoprevention. After starting a chemoprevention agent, close follow-up is important as side effects of chemoprevention are common, including vasomotor symptoms and arthralgias. We also review evidence-based management of chemoprevention side effects."
Endocrine prevention of breast cancer.,"Jahan, Jones, Rahman","Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33882282/,"Breast cancer is the most common non-cutaneous malignancy among women worldwide. Antiestrogen endocrine therapy, commonly known as BC chemoprevention, is an effective method of BC prevention. In multiple randomized trials, two selective estrogen receptor modulators have reduced BC incidence by 50%-65%.","Breast cancer (BC) is the most common non-cutaneous malignancy among women worldwide and is a significant cause of morbidity, mortality, and national health care expenditure. Unfortunately, with few exceptions like alcohol consumption, obesity, and physical activity, most BC risk factors are unmodifiable. Antiestrogen endocrine therapy, commonly known as BC chemoprevention, is an effective method of BC prevention. In multiple randomized trials, two selective estrogen receptor modulators - tamoxifen and raloxifene, and two aromatase inhibitors - exemestane and anastrozole have reduced BC incidence by 50%-65% in high-risk women. An estimated 15% of the US women between 35 and 79 years of age may qualify as high risk for BC, yet a small percentage of these women will ever have a formal BC risk assessment or a discussion of endocrine prevention options. The etiology of underutilization of endocrine prevention of BC is multifactorial - infrequent use of BC risk assessment tools in the primary care settings, insufficient knowledge of BC risk assessment tools and antiestrogen agents among primary care providers, concerns of side effects, inadequate time for counseling during primary care visit, and lack of predictive biomarkers may play significant roles. Many small studies incorporating risk assessment tools and decision-making aids showed minimal success in enhancing endocrine prevention. One critical factor for underutilization of endocrine prevention is low uptake of endocrine prevention by high-risk women even when appropriately recommended. Furthermore, adherence to BC endocrine prevention is unsatisfactorily low. Despite the current infrequent usage, endocrine prevention has the potential to reduce the public health burden of BC significantly. Innovative approaches like finding new agents, alternative dosing and schedule of currently available agents, transdermal medication delivery, increased public and professional awareness, and policymakers' commitments may bring the desired changes."
Non-surgical prevention strategies in women with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndromes.,Singer,"Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32989958/,"Women with a gBRCA1 or 2 mutations face a high cumulative breast and ovarian cancer risk. Tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors have both been evaluated in secondary prevention, but their benefit in primary prevention is currently unknown in BRCA mutation carriers.","Objectives To review non-surgical prevention strategies in women with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndromes. Content Women with a gBRCA1 or 2 mutations face a high cumulative breast and ovarian cancer risk. While bilateral mastectomy (PBM) and bilateral salpingo-oophrectomy (PBSO) profoundly reduce the respective cancer risks, they are also associated with considerable side effects. There is therefore an urgent need for alternative and non-surgical risk reduction options. Tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors have both been evaluated in secondary prevention, but their benefit in primary prevention is currently unknown in BRCA mutation carriers. In addition, their use is compromised by their side effect profile which makes them less appealing for a use in chemoprevention. Summary and outlook Denosumab is a well-tolerated osteoprotective drug, which has been demonstrated to have a potential preventive effect particularly in BRCA1-deficient models in vitro. The prospectively randomized double-blind BRCA-P trial is currently investigating the preventative effect of denosumab in healthy BRCA1 germ line mutation carriers."
Systemic and Local Strategies for Primary Prevention of Breast Cancer.,"Zaluzec, Sempere","Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38254741/,"For women with moderate (15-20%) to average (12.5%) risk of breast cancer, there are few options available for risk reduction.

For women with moderate (15-20%) to average (12.5%) risk of breast cancer, there are few options available for risk reduction. For high-risk (>20%) women, such as <i>BRCA</i> mutation carriers, primary prevention strategies are limited to evidence-based surgical removal of breasts and/or ovaries and anti-estrogen treatment. Despite their effectiveness in risk reduction, not many high-risk individuals opt for surgical or hormonal interventions due to severe side effects and potentially life-changing outcomes as key deterrents. Thus, better communication about the benefits of existing strategies and the development of new strategies with minimal side effects are needed to offer women adequate risk-reducing interventions. We extensively review and discuss innovative investigational strategies for primary prevention. Most of these investigational strategies are at the pre-clinical stage, but some are already being evaluated in clinical trials and others are expected to lead to first-in-human clinical trials within 5 years. Likely, these strategies would be initially tested in high-risk individuals but may be applicable to lower-risk women, if shown to decrease risk at a similar rate to existing strategies, but with minimal side effects."

In the A/J mouse lung model, where different carcinogens induce tumors with different KRAS mutations, glucocorticoids and retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonists are effective agents in prevention and interception studies, irrespective of specific KRAS mutations. In rat azoxymethane-induced colon tumors (45% KRAS mutations), cyclooxygenase 1/2 inhibitors and difluoromethylornithine are effective in preventing or intercepting KRAS-mutated or wild-type tumors. In two KRAS-mutant pancreatic models multiple COX 1/2 inhibitors are effective. Furthermore, combining a COX and an EGFR inhibitor prevented the development of virtually all pancreatic tumors in transgenic mice. In the N-nitroso-N-methylurea-induced estrogen receptor-positive rat breast model (50% HRAS mutations) various selective estrogen receptor modulators, aromatase inhibitors, EGFR inhibitors, and RXR agonists are profoundly effective in prevention and interception of tumors with wild-type or mutant HRAS, while the farnesyltransferase inhibitor tipifarnib preferentially inhibits HRAS-mutant breast tumors. Thus, many agents not known to specifically inhibit the RAS pathway, are effective in an organ specific manner in preventing or intercepting RAS-mutated tumors. Finally, we discuss an alternative prevention and interception approach, employing vaccines to target KRAS."

This study targeted the cholesterol pathway using fluvastatin, a cholesterol-lowering drug, and aspirin, an AMPK activator that acts as a brake in the cholesterol pathway, in a transgenic mouse model of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Using SV40C3 TAg mice, the efficacy and mechanism of fluvastatin, aspirin, or both in combination were compared with vehicle alone. Sixteen-weeks of fluvastatin treatment resulted in significant delay in onset of tumors (20 weeks vs. 16.8 weeks in vehicle treatment, p = 0.01) and inhibited tumor incidence and tumor multiplicity by 50% relative to the vehicle control. In animals that developed tumors, fluvastatin treatment inhibited tumor weight by 75% relative to vehicle control. Aspirin alone did not significantly affect tumor latency, tumor incidence or tumor burden compared to vehicle control. Fluvastatin and aspirin in combination delayed the onset of tumors but failed to inhibit tumor incidence and tumor multiplicity. The growth-inhibitory effects of fluvastatin were mediated through increased FAS/FASL mediated apoptotic cell death that was characterized by increased cleaved PARP and driven in part by depletion of an isoprenoid, geranyl geranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP). In line with NCI's emphasis to repurpose low-toxicity drugs for prevention of cancer, fluvastatin was effective for prevention of TNBC and warrants further clinical testing. Aspirin did not provide chemopreventive benefit."

The first pregnancy induces the expression of a specific genomic signature in the breast.","Sporadic breast cancer is a fatal disease most frequently diagnosed in American women from all ethnic groups, suggesting that primary prevention should be the ultimate goal for breast cancer control. We have developed a novel paradigm for breast cancer prevention arising from the well-established knowledge that an early first full-term pregnancy protects the breast against neoplastic transformation, as well as from our studies of the biological principle underlying this protection. We have shown experimentally that the first pregnancy induces the expression of a specific genomic signature in the breast that results from the completion of a cycle in this organ's differentiation driven by the reproductive process. This signature, in turn, is a biomarker associated with a possible overall lifetime decrease in breast cancer risk. We have shown in an experimental model that a short treatment with human chorionic gonadotropin, a placental hormone secreted during pregnancy, induces the same genomic signature that occurs in pregnancy, inhibiting not only the initiation but also the progression of mammary carcinomas, and stopping the development of early lesions such as intraductal proliferations and carcinoma in situ. These observations indicate that human chorionic gonadotropin given for a very short period, only until this genomic signature is acquired, has significant potential as a chemopreventive agent, protecting the normal cell from becoming malignant. This is a novel concept which challenges the current knowledge that a chemopreventive agent needs to be given for a long period of time to suppress a metabolic pathway or abrogate the function of an organ."

Targeting the estrogen receptor pathway alone with the antiestrogens, Tamoxifen and Raloxifene reduces the incidence of estrogen receptor positive tumors but is ineffective against the development of hormone independent cancers. Our preclinical data indicate that the administration of omega-3 fatty acids potentiates the antitumor effects of Tamoxifen by inhibiting multiple proliferative and antiapoptotic pathways, several of which interact with estrogen receptor signaling. The complementarity in the mechanism of antitumor action of Tamoxifen and omega-3 fatty acids is well supported by our signaling, genomic, and proteomic studies. Furthermore, administration of omega-3 fatty acids allows the use of lower and, hence, likely less toxic doses of Tamoxifen. If these findings are supported in the clinical setting, the combination of omega-3 fatty acids and anteistrogens may emerge as a promising, effective, and safe chemopreventive strategy to be tested in a large multi-institutional trial using breast cancer incidence as the primary endpoint."

Prevention of breast cancer: focus on chemoprevention.,"Costa, Bonanni, Manetti, Guerrieri Gonzaga, Torrisi, Decensi","Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9928543/,Prospects of breast cancer prevention are being developed. Different target populations for breast cancer chemoprevention may be recognized. Prevention trials using clinical endpoints are always subject to high costs. The risk of unexpected detrimental effects has recently been high-lighted.,"Present prospects of breast cancer prevention are being developed in three main areas: (a) genetics, to understand the real importance of familial breast cancer and genetic testing; (b) lifestyle, to study various risk factors, including delayed first pregnancies and smaller number of pregnancies, and months of breast feeding; (c) chemoprevention, to identify chemical agents potentially able to inhibit the development of invasive cancer either by blocking the DNA damage that initiates carcinogenesis or by arresting or reversing the progression of premalignant cells. Different target populations for breast cancer chemoprevention may be recognized. Primary chemoprevention may involve a wide population of healthy women with a moderate risk due to nonpenetrant genetic factors (e.g., one first-degree relative with breast cancer) or exposure to known promoting agents (e.g., hormone replacement therapy). A second level of primary chemoprevention may involve a limited population at very high risk because of highly penetrating genetic predisposition to cancer (e.g., BRCA1 mutation carriers). Secondary chemoprevention may involve subjects with premalignant or early malignant lesions, e.g., breast atypical hyperplasia and carcinoma in situ or microinvasive disease. Prevention trials using clinical endpoints are always subject to high costs. Also, the risk of unexpected detrimental effects has recently been high-lighted, and much emphasis has been put on the search for intermediate, surrogate endpoints. Surrogate endpoints are biological markers that may be assessed or observed prior to the clinical appearance of the disease, bearing some relationship to the development of that disease. They are referred to as intermediate since they occur some time between a given intervention that affected the disease process and the time of the clinical diagnosis of the disease. The use of surrogate endpoint biomarkers in pivotal cancer chemoprevention trials may lead to a rational choice of agents which are likely to affect cancer incidence in subsequent phase III trials."

All studies reviewed were published before June 2008, and all statistical tests were two-sided. Risk models that are based on demographic characteristics and medical history had modest discriminatory accuracy for estimating breast cancer risk (c-statistics range = 0.58-0.63). Breast density was strongly associated with breast cancer (relative risk [RR] = 4.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.10 to 5.26, for Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System category IV vs category I; RR = 4.20, 95% CI = 3.61 to 4.89, for >75% vs <5% of dense area), and adding breast density to models improved discriminatory accuracy (c-statistics range = 0.63-0.66). Estradiol was also associated with breast cancer (RR range = 2.0-2.9, comparing the highest vs lowest quintile of estradiol, P < .01). Most studies found that exercise, weight reduction, low-fat diet, and reduced alcohol intake were associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer. Tamoxifen and raloxifene reduced the risk of estrogen receptor-positive invasive breast cancer and invasive breast cancer overall. Evidence from this study supports screening for breast cancer risk in all postmenopausal women by use of risk factors and breast density and considering chemoprevention for those found to be at high risk. Several lifestyle changes with the potential to prevent breast cancer should be recommended regardless of risk."

Continued advances in understanding the temporal sequencing of relevant exposures promises to shed light on the continuum of breast carcinogenesis. Oral contraceptive use and the transient increase in risk following childbirth are exposures that affect the near-term risk of breast cancer. The availability of commercial testing for inherited susceptibility to breast cancer has accelerated the need for data to develop sound policy for implementing gene testing. The risks associated with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations may be less than previously estimated. Antiestrogens with lesser risks than tamoxifen hold promise for chemoprevention, but await testing. Not enough is known to formulate primary prevention strategies based on lifestyle interventions. Further understanding lifestyle factors that may be involved in the etiology of breast cancer and are amenable to preventive intervention thus remains a top priority, with diet and physical activity of greatest interest."

With respect to early detection, controversy arose regarding the benefit of screening for women younger than 50 years of age. The Canadian National Breast Screening Study showed no decrease in breast cancer mortality for women 40 to 49 years old who were screened annually compared with women who had a baseline breast examination. An international workshop was convened to review results of breast cancer screening trials with emphasis on women younger than 50 years of age. Chemoprevention trials for the primary prevention of breast cancer are underway in North America and Europe. Agents under investigation include tamoxifen and fenretinide. Prevention of breast cancer will also be examined in two trials with multiple disease end points; one is an intervention with low dietary fat, and the other is an intervention with specific micronutrients."

The timing and dose of (chemo-)preventive intervention also affects response. Establishing the benefit of new cancer preventive interventions will take years and possibly decades.,"Approaches to reduce the global burden of cancer include two major strategies: screening and early detection and active preventive intervention. The latter is the topic of this Commentary and spans a broad range of activities. The genetic heterogeneity and complexity of advanced cancers strongly support the rationale for early interruption of the carcinogenic process and an enhanced focus on prevention as a priority strategy to reduce the burden of cancer; however, the focus of cancer prevention management should be on individuals at high risk and on primary localized disease in which screening and detection should also play a vital role. The timing and dose of (chemo-)preventive intervention also affects response. The intervention may be ineffective if the target population is very high risk or already presenting with preneoplastic lesions with cellular changes that cannot be reversed. The field needs to move beyond general concepts of carcinogenesis to targeted organ site prevention approaches in patients at high risk, as is currently being done for breast and colorectal cancers. Establishing the benefit of new cancer preventive interventions will take years and possibly decades, depending on the outcome being evaluated. We also propose that comparative effectiveness research designs and the value of information obtained from large-scale prevention studies are necessary in order for preventive interventions to become a routine part of cancer management."
Tamoxifen for the primary prevention of breast cancer: a review and critique of the concept and trial.,"Bush, Helzlsouer","Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8405207/,"This paper has reviewed the rationale for and design of the NSABP Breast Cancer Prevention Trial.

If the assumptions and estimates from the trial protocol are correct, the net benefit of the trial will be moderately large and positive (50 to 77 events prevented). However, over 500 women per year will be treated with tamoxifen unnecessarily. Recalculation of the net-benefit table using another set of reasonable assumptions regarding risks and the trial assumptions regarding benefits shows a negative effect to a small positive effect overall (-17 to 8 events). If the probability of adverse ocular events is included in the net-benefit equations, it appears that more harm than good will result from the intervention. In the face of the uncertainty regarding the net benefit of the trial, ranges of these risks and benefits should be provided to both potential and enrolled participants. The lack of significant benefit to participants seen with the recalculations may raise the question of whether the trial should continue as designed. One option would be to limit trial participation to postmenopausal women only, since 1) breast cancer is more common in postmenopausal women, 2) tamoxifen is more effective in postmenopausal women, 3) cardiovascular disease is more common in postmenopausal women, and 4) reductions in cholesterol levels and preservation of bone mass have only been documented in postmenopausal women (11, 27). Even in this case, however, the fundamental philosophical question of whether large numbers of healthy women should be ""treated"" with a toxic drug for the primary prevention of a rare event remains."

The suggestion of potential agents for the primary chemoprevention of breast cancer evolved out of the treatment setting. Extensive experience with tamoxifen, a first-generation selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) showing efficacy, first, in the treatment of advanced breast cancer and, subsequently, as adjuvant therapy for early stage disease established the safety of this agent. Cumulative data from multiple adjuvant studies documented the efficacy of tamoxifen in reducing second primary breast cancers in the contralateral breast, supporting its potential as a chemopreventive agent for breast cancer. The safety and second primary data on tamoxifen, together with extensive information on its pharmacokinetics, metabolism, and antitumor effects, as well as its potentially beneficial effects on lipid metabolism and osteoporosis, led the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) to select tamoxifen for testing in the first prospective randomized phase III trial of the efficacy of a chemopreventive agent for preventing breast cancer in women at increased risk of the disease. Accordingly, in 1992 the NSABP started the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial (P-1) in which 13,388 women > or = 35 years of age who were at increased risk of breast cancer according to Gail model risk factors [family history, age, and personal history (i.e., age at first birth, age at menarche, previous breast biopsies)] were randomized to tamoxifen 20 mg/day or placebo for 5 years. Through 69 months of follow-up tamoxifen reduced the risk of invasive breast cancer, primarily estrogen receptor-positive tumors, by 49% (two-sided p < 0.00001). Tamoxifen reduced the risk of noninvasive breast cancer by 50% (two-sided p < 0.002). In addition, tamoxifen reduced fractures of the hip, radius, and spine, but it had no effect on the rate of ischemic heart disease. As previously shown, the rates of endometrial cancer and vascular events increased with tamoxifen. With the P-1 results establishing tamoxifen as the standard of care for the primary chemoprevention of breast cancer in high-risk women, concern over the side effects of tamoxifen has prompted a continuing search for an agent that displays a more desirable efficacy/toxicity profile. Raloxifene, a second-generation SERM approved for the prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, displays antiestrogenic properties in the breast and possibly the endometrium, and estrogenic effects in the bone and on the lipid profile, suggesting it as a candidate for comparison with the chemopreventive standard, tamoxifen. Raloxifene will be compared to tamoxifen in an equivalency trial, the Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene (STAR) NSABP P-2, which began in July 1999 at almost 500 centers in North America. The plan is to randomize 22,000 postmenopausal women > or = 35 years of age at increased risk of breast cancer by Gail criteria to tamoxifen 20 mg/day or raloxifene 60 mg/day for 5 years. Study endpoints include invasive and noninvasive breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, endometrial cancer, bone fractures, and vascular events."

The aim of the paper was to review the available evidence regarding breast cancer chemoprevention trials. A systematic literature search was conducted to identify all full‑scale, randomized prospective chemoprevention trials as well as similarly conducted randomized trials with breast cancer as the primary monitoring endpoint. In full‑scale, randomized chemoprevention trials, the selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), tamoxifen and raloxifene, reduce breast cancer incidence. In a direct comparison, tamoxifen resulted in greater breast cancer reduction than raloxifene but with greater endometrial cancer risk. The aromatase inhibitors, exemestane and anastrozole, also reduce breast cancer incidence in breast cancer prevention trials. In the Women's Health Initiative hormone therapy trials, in postmenopausal women with no prior hysterectomy, estrogen plus progestin increased breast cancer incidence and deaths from breast cancer, while estrogen alone, in women with prior hysterectomy, reduced breast cancer incidence and reduced deaths from breast cancer. For premenopausal women at increased breast cancer risk, tamoxifen is a proven option with favorable side effect profile. For postmenopausal women, while no direct comparison of SERMs and aromatase inhibitors for chemoprevention are available, cross‑study comparisons suggest greater efficacy and more favorable side effect profile for aromatase inhibitor use, especially for older women. The opposite effects of estrogen plus progestin compared with estrogen alone on breast cancer incidence and outcome should factor into risk‑benefit consideration when these agents are considered for climacteric symptom management."

Approximately 15% of women, age 35-79 years, in the U.S. meet criteria for breast cancer preventive therapies, but uptake of these medications remain low. Explanations for this low uptake includelack of awareness of breast cancer risk status, insufficient knowledge about breast cancer preventive therapies among patients and physicians, and toxicity concerns. Increasing acceptance of pharmacologic breast cancer prevention will require effective communication of breast cancer risk, accurate representation about the potential benefits and side effects of anti-estrogens, targeting-specific high-risk populations most likely to benefit from preventive therapy, and minimizing the side effects of current anti-estrogens with novel administration and dosing options. One strategy to improve the uptake of chemoprevention strategies is to consider lessons learned from the use of drugs to prevent other chronic conditions, such as cardiovascular disease. Enhancing uptake and adherence to anti-estrogens for primary prevention holds promise for significantly reducing breast cancer incidence, however, this will require a significant change in our current clinical practice and stronger advocacy and awareness at the national level."

Moreover, retinoids have been used successfully for the treatment of certain malignancies, especially acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) in adults and neuroblastoma in children. However, retinoids have not yet been translated into effective systemic treatments for most solid cancers. Some recent studies have shown that retinoids promote tumorigenesis. Therefore, we performed this meta-analysis to systematically evaluate the efficacy of retinoids in the chemoprevention and treatment of cancers. We performed literature search of several electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library from 2000 January to 2021 November. Various outcomes were applied to investigate the potential of retinoids for prevention and treatment of cancers. The primary outcomes in this study were disease recurrence and clinical response. The secondary outcomes included overall survival (OS), cancer development, disease progression and event-free survival. We identified 39 randomized controlled trials with 15,627 patients in this study. Our results showed that lower recurrence rate and better clinical response were obtained in retinoids treated patients with cancer or premalignancy as compared with control. The differences were statistically significant (RR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.74-0.96, <i>p</i> = 0.01; RR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.03-1.49, <i>p</i> = 0.02, respectively). Retinoids treatment was not associated with improvement in overall survival, cancer development, disease progression or event-free survival. Subgroup analysis conducted based on cancer type showed that patients benefited from retinoids treatment in APL, renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, lung cancer, Kaposi sarcoma, and complete hydatidiform mole. No significant therapeutic effect was noted in head and neck cancer, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), melanoma, breast cancer, bladder cancer, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or cervical carcinoma. Subgroup analysis based on tumor classification demonstrated that retinoids group obtained a lower recurrence rate and better clinical response than control group in solid cancers. In conclusion, clinical application of retinoids was associated with reduction in disease recurrence and improvement in clinical response, illustrating that retinoids play a key role in cancer prevention and therapy.

The most critical methods issue concerns the definitive end point of phase III trials, which is now cancer incidence. This end point usually needs thousands of subjects monitored for 5 to 10 or more years to determine efficacy. Biologic markers of potential intermediate end points are under intensive study and may one day replace cancer incidence. Validated intermediate end point biomarkers could greatly reduce phase III trial populations, durations, and costs. Randomized clinical trials over the last 5 years have produced significant activity in reversing oral, skin, colon, and cervical premalignancy; in preventing primary skin and stomach cancer; and in preventing second primary tumors associated with head and neck and lung cancer. These clinical advances have been paralleled at the basic science level by elegant molecular studies of premalignant carcinogenesis and of chemopreventive agents' mechanisms of action. One major laboratory advance is the discovery of nuclear retinoic acid receptors and strong evidence of their roles both in carcinogenic progression and in its response to retinoids. Chemoprevention has matured greatly in recent years with the significant reversal or suppression of premalignancy by chemopreventive agents in several sites. The future of chemoprevention will be determined largely by several ongoing phase III trials, including trials of retinoids, beta-carotene, and alpha-tocopherol in the aerodigestive tract, of tamoxifen and fenretinide in the breast, and of finasteride in the prostate."

Reports suggest that exogenous hormone therapy is associated with only moderate or no excess risk of breast cancer. Studies examining the association between exposure to organochlorine compounds and the risk of breast cancer are inconsistent and further investigations are required. The report by the International Workshop of Screening for Breast Cancer emphasizes the benefit in reducing breast cancer mortality to be gained by regular screening among women aged 50 years and older. Age is the strongest predictor of breast cancer risk, yet screening rates tend to diminish with age. Chemoprevention trials for the primary prevention of breast cancer are underway in North America and Europe. Agents under investigation include tamoxifen and fenretinide.

A beneficial effect in reducing cardiac morbidity has been observed among women taking 40 mg/d of tamoxifen for at least 2 years. Several studies demonstrated the increased risk of endometrial pathologic changes, including endometrial cancer associated with tamoxifen therapy. Because of the uncertainty of net risks and benefits, close monitoring for adverse side effects should be incorporated into ongoing prevention trials."

Several clinical trials have recently shown the feasibility of this approach in reducing the risk of major human cancers. In the USA, a large trial that demonstrated a reduction of approximately 50% in the risk of developing breast cancer led to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of tamoxifen as a preventive agent in women at increased risk. Although the results could not be reproduced in two smaller European trials, further investigations into this agent are clearly warranted. Raloxifene, another selective oestrogen receptor modulator which has reduced the risk of breast cancer in a trial in women with osteoporosis, is being compared with tamoxifen in a large primary prevention trial in at-risk women. Retinoids are a group of compounds that have proved especially effective in reducing the occurrence of second primary tumours in subjects with skin, head and neck or liver cancer. Fenretinide, a synthetic retinoic acid derivative, has recently been shown to decrease the occurrence of a second breast malignancy in premenopausal women. Results with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have proved consistently encouraging in epidemiological studies in lowering the incidence of colorectal cancer. Clinical trials with selective cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors potentially devoid of gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity are currently underway in at-risk subjects. Calcium and selenium have also received much attention as chemopreventive agents. Originally investigated against skin cancer, selenium showed efficacy in reducing prostate, lung and colon cancer incidence. Similarly, vitamin E was effective in reducing prostate cancer incidence and mortality in a lung cancer prevention trial in heavy smokers. The challenges of conducting well-designed and unequivocal chemoprevention trials are considerable, but advances in techniques of identification of at-risk subjects and establishing surrogate endpoint biomarkers should contribute greatly to future studies. Current knowledge suggests that a pharmacological approach to preventing cancer, using natural or synthetic agents, could become an important way forward."
A novel Bayesian adaptive design incorporating both primary and secondary endpoints for randomized IIB chemoprevention study of women at increased risk for breast cancer.,"Gajewski, Kimler, Koestler, Mudaranthakam, Young, Fabian","Randomized Controlled Trial, Journal Article",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36471449/,Two-endpoint adaptive trial stops early only if a criterion is met for primary and secondary endpoints. The approach focuses the final analysis on the primary endpoint but ensures adequate data for the secondary analysis. Our approach balances trial speed and the need for information on a key secondary endpoint.,"Our randomized controlled clinical trial will explore the potential of bazedoxifene plus conjugated estrogen to modulate breast tissue-based risk biomarkers as a surrogate for breast cancer risk reduction. This paper investigates the statistical design features of the trial and the rationale for the final choice of its design. Group sequential designs are a popular design approach to allow a trial to stop early for success or futility, potentially saving time and money over a fixed trial design. While Bayesian adaptive designs enjoy the same properties as group sequential designs, they have the added benefit of using prior information as well as inferential interpretation conditional on the data. Whether a frequentist or Bayesian trial, most adaptive designs have interim analyses that allow for early stopping, typically utilizing only the primary endpoint. A drawback to this approach is that the study may not have enough data for adequate comparisons of a single, key secondary endpoint. This can happen, for example, if the secondary endpoint has a smaller effect than the primary endpoint. In this paper, we investigate a trial design called two-endpoint adaptive, which stops early only if a criterion is met for primary and secondary endpoints. The approach focuses the final analysis on the primary endpoint but ensures adequate data for the secondary analysis. Our study has two arms with a primary (change in mammographic fibroglandular volume) and secondary endpoint (change in mammary tissue Ki-67). We present operating characteristics including power, trial duration, and type I error rate and discuss the value and risks of modeling Bayesian group sequential designs with primary and secondary endpoints, comparing against alternative designs. The results indicate that the two-endpoint adaptive design has better operating characteristics than competing designs if one is concerned about having adequate information for a key secondary endpoint. Our approach balances trial speed and the need for information on the single, key secondary endpoint."
Cancer chemoprevention.,Itri,"Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8242570/,Treatment with 13-cis-retinoic acid has reversed oral leukoplakia. Tamoxifen has proven effective in preventing both the recurrence of breast cancer and the development of new tumors in the contralateral breast.,"Encouraging results from several recent trials have increased interest in the potential of chemoprevention in reducing the incidence of cancer. Treatment with 13-cis-retinoic acid has reversed oral leukoplakia, a premalignant lesion, and prevented the development of second primary carcinomas of the head and neck. Tamoxifen has proven effective in preventing both the recurrence of breast cancer and the development of new tumors in the contralateral breast, and is being tested in high-risk patients who have not yet developed disease. The results of the Physicians' Health Study, which demonstrated the effectiveness of aspirin in reducing heart attacks, already have been incorporated into health care practice, while the component investigating the effect of beta carotene on the incidence of cancer still is underway. These studies demonstrate the importance of careful design if chemoprevention trials are to yield convincing data."
"Targeting ""Retired Antigens"" for Cancer Immunoprevention.","Shoemaker, Forsthuber","Editorial, Comment",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29093010/,"Targeting ""retired antigens,"" a specialized type of self-antigen, may have considerable advantages. Antigens no longer expressed in mature or aged individuals should pose reduced risk of autoimmune sequelae. Women who are BRCA1/2 carriers may be among the first to benefit.","Identification of immune targets for cancer immunoprevention, or immunotherapy, has historically focused on tumor-associated (self) antigens or neoantigens expressed on malignant cells. For self-antigens, overcoming tolerance can be a difficult challenge. Neoantigens do not suffer from this limitation, but the lack of recurrent mutations yielding common neoantigens that can be exploited in vaccines is a problem for many tumor types. Targeting ""retired antigens,"" a specialized type of self-antigen, may have considerable advantages. Antigens no longer expressed in mature or aged individuals should pose reduced risk of autoimmune sequelae. Indeed, self-tolerance of these antigens may have naturally faded. Thus, when the retired antigens are highly expressed in cancer cells, it may be easier to overcome the remaining tolerance. Women who are BRCA1/2 carriers may be among the first to benefit as candidate retired antigens have been identified as highly expressed in ovarian and breast cancer cells. Although there is good preclinical data supporting this immune targeting concept, additional research is needed to understand the underlying immune phenomena and optimize the vaccine strategy. <i>Cancer Prev Res; 10(11); 607-8. ©2017 AACR</i><i>See related article by Mazumder et al., p. 612</i>."

Furthermore, breast cancer often develops in young people, even those only in their 30s, who play a central role in their families and society. Results from many cohort studies suggest that dietary factors, alcohol consumption, lack of physical activity, obesity, nulliparity, breastfeeding, oral contraceptive use, fertility treatment and hormone replacement therapy are risk factors for breast cancer. However, the effects of lifestyle habits on the human body are complexly intertwined with various factors, and the effects vary from person to person depending on their constitution, etc., so there is no basis for this. Therefore, primary prevention of breast cancer is still not being implemented appropriately and efficiently. Furthermore, advances in genomic technology make it possible to assess the risk of developing breast cancer in some individuals. As a result, the establishment of breast cancer prevention methods has become a health priority for high-risk individuals.Drugs such as tamoxifen and raloxifene are known to prevent the development of breast cancer, based on the results of multiple randomized controlled trials, but there are concerns regarding the side effects of these powerful agents. In addition, several clinical studies have shown that prophylactic mastectomy for women who have BRCA mutations or who are identified as being at high risk reduces the incidence of breast cancer development. However, many issues, such as changes in long-term quality of life after preventive surgery, the optimal timing of surgery and the identification of women who are at high risk but will not develop breast cancer, remain uncertain. In other words, although many researchers have focused on chemoprevention and surgical prevention and clear preventive effects of these strategies have been confirmed, it cannot be said that they are widely accepted. Therefore, the current evidence for chemoprevention and surgical prevention, as well as highlights of several interesting lines of research currently underway, are summarized in this article."
What Factors Influence Decision-Making about Breast Cancer Chemoprevention among High-Risk Women?,Crew,"Editorial, Comment",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28978567/,Estrogen exposure is one of the strongest risk factors for breast cancer development.

Chemoprevention with selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM), such as tamoxifen and raloxifene, has been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce breast cancer incidence by up to 50% among high-risk women. Despite the strength of this evidence, there is significant underutilization of chemoprevention. Given the relatively few modifiable breast cancer risk factors, SERM use provides an important strategy for the primary prevention of this disease.

Addressing barriers to uptake of breast cancer chemoprevention for patients and providers.,Crew,Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25993215/,An estimated 10 million women in the United States meet high-risk criteria for breast cancer. Less than 5% of women at high risk who are offered antiestrogens for primary prevention agree to take it. Widespread adoption of chemoprevention will require a major paradigm shift in clinical practice.,"Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women in the United States, and the primary prevention of this disease is a major public health issue. Because there are relatively few modifiable breast cancer risk factors, pharmacologic interventions with antiestrogens have the potential to significantly affect the primary prevention setting. Breast cancer chemoprevention with selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) tamoxifen and raloxifene, and with aromatase inhibitors (AIs) exemestane and anastrozole, is underutilized despite several randomized controlled trials demonstrating up to a 50% to 65% relative risk reduction in breast cancer incidence among women at high risk. An estimated 10 million women in the United States meet high-risk criteria for breast cancer and are potentially eligible for chemoprevention, but less than 5% of women at high risk who are offered antiestrogens for primary prevention agree to take it. Reasons for low chemoprevention uptake include lack of routine breast cancer risk assessment in primary care, inadequate time for counseling, insufficient knowledge about antiestrogens among patients and providers, and concerns about side effects. Interventions designed to increase chemoprevention uptake, such as decision aids and incorporating breast cancer risk assessment into clinical practice, have met with limited success. Clinicians can help women make informed decisions about chemoprevention by effectively communicating breast cancer risk and enhancing knowledge about the risks and benefits of antiestrogens. Widespread adoption of chemoprevention will require a major paradigm shift in clinical practice for primary care providers (PCPs). However, enhancing uptake and adherence to breast cancer chemoprevention holds promise for reducing the public health burden of this disease."

Use of tamoxifen and raloxifene for primary breast cancer prevention was still low.,"Persistently increased blood levels of estrogens are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) are a class of compounds that act on the estrogen receptor (ER). Several clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of its prophylactic administration. Incidence of invasive ER-positive breast cancer was reduced by SERMs treatment, especially for those women with high risk of developing breast cancer. In this study, we reviewed the clinical application of SERMs in breast cancer prevention. To date, four prospective randomized clinical trials had been performed to test the efficacy of tamoxifen for this purpose. Concerning on the benefit and cost of tamoxifen, various studies from different countries demonstrated that chemoprevention with tamoxifen seemed to be cost-effective for women with a high risk of invasive breast cancer. Based above, tamoxifen was approved for breast cancer prevention by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1998. Raloxifene was also approved for postmenopausal women in 2007 for breast cancer prevention which reduces the risk of invasive breast cancer with a lower risk of unwanted stimulation of endometrium. Thus, raloxifene is considered to have a better clinical possesses as prophylactic agent. Several other agents, such as arzoxifene and lasofoxifene, are currently being investigated in clinic. The American Society of Clinical Oncology and National Comprehensive Cancer Network had published guidelines on breast cancer chemoprevention by SERMs. However, use of tamoxifen and raloxifene for primary breast cancer prevention was still low. A broader educational effort is needed to alert women and primary care physicians that SERMs are available to reduce breast cancer risk."

New evidence of synergistic interaction between the nuclear receptors for the two groups of nutritional agents suggests that appropriate selective ligands from each group might be combined in breast cancer chemoprevention studies. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma is a nuclear receptor that is activated by PUFAs, eicosanoids and antidiabetic agents such as troglitazone. Such activation can cause growth inhibition in human mammary cancer cells in culture and the effect is enhanced by ligands of retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR). In mouse mammary tissue in organ culture, an RXR-selective ligand has been shown to enhance the effect of troglitazone in suppressing carcinogen-induced pre-neoplastic changes. A PPAR/RXR heterodimer is involved in tumour growth inhibition and has been shown to bind directly to nuclear oestrogen response elements (ERE) independently of oestrogen receptor (ER) activity. A combination of an RXR-selective retinoid with either troglitazone or else a long-chain n-3 PUFA, is proposed for a short-term study in postmenopausal women after primary surgery for intraductal breast cancer. The resulting activation of PPAR/RXR expression may increase response to retinoid administration, especially in the presence of obesity and insulin resistance, because of the ability of PPAR gamma ligands to reduce insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) concentrations. Serial core biopsies of breast tissue over a short term are proposed to identify changes in phenotype, which may influence progression to invasiveness. In addition to cytomorphological criteria, expression of ER alpha and beta, RAR alpha and beta, and IGF-I receptor in the nucleus should be examined."

Risk-reducing surgery, such as prophylactic bilateral mastectomy and prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, are proven strategies to prevent breast and ovarian cancer. These procedures are, however, associated with considerable side effects, and the uptake of these highly effective interventions is therefore low in many countries. This highlights the need for alternative and noninvasive strategies for risk reduction in mutation carriers. While endocrine treatments with tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors (AI) have been shown to be effective in secondary prevention, their benefit in primary prevention has never been prospectively evaluated. Moreover, their side effect profile makes them inappropriate candidates for chemoprevention in healthy premenopausal women. Recently, denosumab, a well-tolerated osteoprotective drug, has been shown to have an antitumoral effect on RANK+, <i>BRCA1</i>-deficient luminal progenitor cells in vitro, and has been demonstrated to abrogate tumors in <i>BRCA1</i>-deficient mouse models.

The groups developed summary papers through an iterative process which, following further appraisal from experts and patients, were melded into this summary account. The 10 major gaps identified were: (1) understanding the functions and contextual interactions of genetic and epigenetic changes in normal breast development and during malignant transformation; (2) how to implement sustainable lifestyle changes (diet, exercise and weight) and chemopreventive strategies; (3) the need for tailored screening approaches including clinically actionable tests; (4) enhancing knowledge of molecular drivers behind breast cancer subtypes, progression and metastasis; (5) understanding the molecular mechanisms of tumour heterogeneity, dormancy, de novo or acquired resistance and how to target key nodes in these dynamic processes; (6) developing validated markers for chemosensitivity and radiosensitivity; (7) understanding the optimal duration, sequencing and rational combinations of treatment for improved personalised therapy; (8) validating multimodality imaging biomarkers for minimally invasive diagnosis and monitoring of responses in primary and metastatic disease; (9) developing interventions and support to improve the survivorship experience; (10) a continuing need for clinical material for translational research derived from normal breast, blood, primary, relapsed, metastatic and drug-resistant cancers with expert bioinformatics support to maximise its utility.

The risk of developing breast cancer is the primary determinant of net benefit, with greater net benefits accruing to women with the highest risk of breast cancer. Both age and the presence of factors that increase the risk of toxicity have the greatest effect on the net benefit associated with tamoxifen. The greatest clinical benefit with least side effects is derived from the use of tamoxifen in younger, premenopausal women who are less likely to have thromboembolic complications and uterine cancer, in women without a uterus, and in women at higher breast cancer risk such as those with atypical hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ.

Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, is approved for use in metastatic breast cancer (MBC), the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer, and the prevention of breast cancer in women at high risk. The 50% reduction in breast cancer incidence seen with tamoxifen is significant for women at increased risk but is accompanied by notable toxicities such as thrombotic events and endometrial cancer. Therefore, the development of other effective agents with less toxicity would be a major advance in breast cancer prevention. Aromatase inhibitors, recently approved for the treatment of MBC and in the adjuvant setting, are proving to be slightly more effective than tamoxifen therapy. These drugs, approved for use in only postmenopausal women, inhibit the enzyme aromatase and thereby lower circulating functional estrogen. To date, the most concerning side effect of these agents is an increase in fracture rate. Compared with tamoxifen, thrombotic events and endometrial cancer rates are much lower. Ongoing data from the Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination trial continue to favor anastrozole over tamoxifen in the reduction of primary contralateral breast cancers. This information has prompted breast cancer chemoprevention trials with AIs. Although tamoxifen is the gold standard for prevention therapy, results of ongoing studies may indicate a role for AIs in the prevention of breast cancer."

The overall prevalence of BRCA1/2 mutations is estimated to be from 1 in 400 to 1 in 800 with a higher prevalence in the Ashkenazi Jewish population (1 in 40). Estimates of penetrance (cancer risk) vary considerably depending on the context in which they were derived and have been shown to vary within families with the same BRCA1/2 mutation. This suggests there is no exact risk estimate that can be applied to all individuals with a BRCA1/2 mutation. The likelihood of harboring a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation is dependent on one's personal and/or family history of cancer and can be estimated using various mutation probability models. For those individuals who have a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, several screening and primary prevention options have been suggested, including prophylactic surgery and chemoprevention. Once a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation has been identified in a family, testing of at-risk relatives can identify those family members who also have the familial mutation and thus need increased surveillance and early intervention when a cancer is diagnosed."

While the association between Vitamin D levels and breast cancer risk/prognosis is still controversial, the U-shaped relationship between 250 H-D levels observed in different studies suggests the need to avoid both deficient and too high levels. Further trials using an optimal dose range are needed to assess the preventive and therapeutic effect of vitamin D. Finally, Fenretinide, a pro-apoptotic and pro-oxidant vitamin A derivative, has shown promise in several trials and its preventive potential is being assessed in young women at very high risk for breast cancer."
Screening and prevention of breast cancer in primary care.,"Tice, Kerlikowske",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19616154/,There is little controversy that mammography reduces the risk of dying from breast cancer by about 23%. The harms associated with false-positive results and overdiagnosis limit the net benefit of mammography. Digital mammography is more sensitive than film mammography in young women. Magnetic resonance imaging may benefit the highest risk women.,"Mammography remains the mainstay of breast cancer screening. There is little controversy that mammography reduces the risk of dying from breast cancer by about 23% among women between the ages of 50 and 69 years, although the harms associated with false-positive results and overdiagnosis limit the net benefit of mammography. Women in their 70s may have a small benefit from screening mammography, but overdiagnosis increases in this age group as do competing causes of death. While new data support a 16% reduction in breast cancer mortality for 40- to 49-year-old women after 10 years of screening, the net benefit is less compelling in part because of the lower incidence of breast cancer in this age group and because mammography is less sensitive and specific in women younger than 50 years. Digital mammography is more sensitive than film mammography in young women with similar specificity, but no improvements in breast cancer outcomes have been demonstrated. Magnetic resonance imaging may benefit the highest risk women. Randomized trials suggest that self-breast examination does more harm than good. Primary prevention with currently approved medications will have a negligible effect on breast cancer incidence. Public health efforts aimed at increasing mammography screening rates, promoting regular exercise in all women, maintaining a healthy weight, limiting alcohol intake, and limiting postmenopausal hormone therapy may help to continue the recent trend of lower breast cancer incidence and mortality among American women."
Incorporating Biomarkers in Studies of Chemoprevention.,"Fabian, Kimler","Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26987531/,"Despite Food and Drug Administration approval of tamoxifen and raloxifene for breast cancer risk reduction, uptake of these drugs for primary prevention in the United States is only 4% for risk eligible women. Side effects coupled with incomplete efficacy and lack of a survival advantage are the likely reasons.","Despite Food and Drug Administration approval of tamoxifen and raloxifene for breast cancer risk reduction and endorsement by multiple agencies, uptake of these drugs for primary prevention in the United States is only 4% for risk eligible women likely to benefit from their use. Side effects coupled with incomplete efficacy and lack of a survival advantage are the likely reasons. This disappointing uptake, after the considerable effort and expense of large Phase III cancer incidence trials required for approval, suggests that a new paradigm is required. Current prevention research is focused on (1) refining risk prediction, (2) exploring behavioral and natural product interventions, and (3) utilizing novel translational trial designs for efficacy. Risk biomarkers will play a central role in refining risk estimates from traditional models and selecting cohorts for prevention trials. Modifiable risk markers called surrogate endpoint or response biomarkers will continue to be used in Phase I and II prevention trials to determine optimal dose or exposure and likely effectiveness from an intervention. The majority of Phase II trials will continue to assess benign breast tissue for response and mechanism of action biomarkers. Co-trials are those in which human and animal cohorts receive the same effective dose and the same tissue biomarkers are assessed for modulation due to the intervention, but then additional animals are allowed to progress to cancer development. These collaborations linking biomarker modulation and cancer prevention may obviate the need for cancer incidence trials for non-prescription interventions."
Radial Profile Analysis of Epithelial Polarity in Breast Acini: A Tool for Primary (Breast) Cancer Prevention.,"Manning, Holmes, Bonin, Vidi",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31998733/,"In the breast and in other organs of epithelial origin, apical-basal polarity is key to homeostasis and is one of the first tissue characteristics lost during cancer initiation. We developed an algorithm that essentially replaces the human eye to objectively quantify epithelial polarity in microscopy images of breast glandular units (acini)","Preventing cancer is vastly better than treating the disease in terms of a patient's quality of life and healthcare costs. Yet, to screen for chemopreventative drugs or evaluate interventions aimed at lowering cancer risk, quantitative readouts of risk are needed. In the breast and in other organs of epithelial origin, apical-basal polarity is key to homeostasis and is one of the first tissue characteristics lost during cancer initiation. Therefore, apical-basal polarity may be leveraged as an ""architectural"" determinant of cancer risk. A classic approach to quantify the localization of epithelial polarity markers is visual scoring at the microscope by trained investigators. This approach is time-intensive and limited to low throughput. To increase the speed, accuracy, and scoring volume, we developed an algorithm that essentially replaces the human eye to objectively quantify epithelial polarity in microscopy images of breast glandular units (acini). Acini in culture are identified based on a nuclear stain and the corresponding masks are divided into concentric terraces of equal width. This positional information is used to calculate radial intensity profiles (RP) of polarity markers. Profiles with a steep slope represent polarized structures, whereas more horizontal curves are indicative of non-polarized acini. To compare treatment effects, RP curves are integrated into summary values of polarity. We envision applications of this method for primary cancer prevention research with acini organoids, specifically (1) to screen for chemoprevention drugs, (2) for toxicological assessment of suspected carcinogens and pharmacological hit compounds, and (3) for personalized evaluation of cancer risk and risk-reducing interventions. The RadialProfiler algorithm developed for the MATLAB computing environment and for users without prior informatics knowledge is publicly available on the Open Science Framework (OSF)."

Although no one can predict who will actually develop breast cancer, a number of risk factors have been found that allow clinicians to identify the women at highest risk. Recent research has focused on exploring options, such as chemoprevention, to prevent high-risk women from developing breast cancer. The selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulators (SERMs) were a logical choice for chemoprevention because of their well-known estrogen antagonist effects in the breast. Tamoxifen is the best studied of these agents and has been shown to reduce the incidence of all breast cancers by 38% and ER-positive tumors by 48%.(1) However, despite this large potential risk reduction, risk management with chemopreventive agents is still not routine.

Raloxifene was proposed as an alternative to tamoxifen based on its estrogen antagonist effects in the breast and its relative safety as an osteoporosis agent. In this article, we will review the trials that led to the emergence of both tamoxifen and raloxifene as chemopreventive agents and will then offer a management strategy for breast cancer prevention in the primary care setting."

Hormonal approaches to breast cancer treatment and prevention: an overview.,Vogel,"Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8824459/,Tamoxifen appears to be the therapy of choice for the initial treatment of metastatic breast cancer in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Some clinicians prefer oophorectomy or the use of luteinizing hormone releasing hormone analogues.,"Hormonal agents play a critical role in the palliation of advanced breast cancer, as well as adjuvant therapy to surgery and radiation in patients with primary breast cancer. Tamoxifen appears to be the therapy of choice for the initial treatment of metastatic breast cancer in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women, although some clinicians prefer oophorectomy or the use of luteinizing hormone releasing hormone analogues in premenopausal patients. Historically, second-line hormonal therapy for metastatic disease has been with a progestin; however, due to the troubling side effects of weight gain and dyspnea, progestins may soon be replaced by aromatase inhibitors. The development of new antiestrogens lacking estrogen-agonist activity for metastatic disease is in its earliest clinical developmental phases. For adjuvant therapy in postmenopausal women, there is conflicting evidence as to whether the combination of a hormonal agent (ie, tamoxifen) plus chemotherapy provides an advantage over hormonal therapy alone. In premenopausal women areas of active investigation include combination hormonal therapy (eg, tamoxifen plus luteinizing hormone releasing hormone analogues or oophorectomy) and combination chemohormonal therapy (concomitant v sequential). Tamoxifen had been associated with rare cases of thromboembolic events and secondary endometrial cancers. The etiology of these secondary cancers is unclear and controversial; however, the benefits of tamoxifen far outweigh the risks for both palliative and surgical adjuvant therapy. The success of tamoxifen in preventing cancer recurrence in the contralateral breast has led to clinical investigation of the drug for the chemoprevention of breast cancer in women at high risk for development of the disease. The role of tamoxifen for this indication remains to be determined following completion of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project trial in North America and additional trials in the United Kingdom and Italy."

There is extensive biologic and clinical evidence implicating estrogenic stimulation in the development and progression of breast cancer. The success of tamoxifen in adjuvant breast cancer trials in delaying the recurrence of disease and preventing second primary breast cancers and, in postmenopausal women, conferring a survival benefit, has led to increasing interest in the use of tamoxifen as a chemopreventive agent against breast cancer. It remains to be seen whether tamoxifen will act as a true preventive agent or whether it will merely delay the appearance of breast cancer, in which case the use of the drug may alter the natural history of the disease in women who have been exposed to tamoxifen. The optimal duration of drug intervention, the appropriate target population for chemoprevention, and the cost-benefit ratio of tamoxifen prevention are all issues that must be formally addressed in carefully controlled trials. Some data concerning duration and side effects are already available from epidemiologic studies and long-term clinical follow-up of patients exposed to tamoxifen."
Retinoids and their receptors in cancer development and chemoprevention.,"Sun, Lotan","Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11796231/,"Retinoids play an important role in regulating the growth and differentiation of normal, premalignant and malignant cell types. Vitamin A deficiency in experimental animals has been associated with a higher incidence of cancer and with increased susceptibility to chemical carcinogens.","Retinoids play an important role in regulating the growth and differentiation of normal, premalignant and malignant cell types, especially epithelial cells, mainly through interaction with two types of nuclear receptors: retinoic acid receptors (RARalpha, beta and gamma) and retinoid X receptors (RXRalpha, beta and gamma). Vitamin A deficiency in experimental animals has been associated with a higher incidence of cancer and with increased susceptibility to chemical carcinogens. This is in agreement with the epidemiological studies indicating that individuals with a lower dietary vitamin A intake are at a higher risk to develop cancer. At the molecular level, aberrant expression and function of nuclear retinoid receptors have been found in various types of cancer including premalignant lesions. Thus, aberrations in retinoid signaling are early events in carcinogenesis. Retinoids at pharmacological doses exhibit a variety of effects associated with cancer prevention. They suppress transformation of cells in vitro, inhibit carcinogenesis in various organs in animal models, reduce premalignant human epithelial lesions and prevent second primary tumors following curative therapy for epithelial malignancies such as head and neck, lung, liver, and breast cancer."

These consist mainly of breast self-examination, mammography screening, chemoprevention and prophylactic surgery (mastectomy, oophorectomy). This paper examines clinical practices related to hereditary breast cancer testing and introduces a number of results from a survey carried out, between 1996 and 1998, in three clinics located in Montreal (Quebec, Canada), Marseilles (France) and Manchester (Great Britain). Results show substantial differences in the way cancer geneticists deal with environmental risk factors, breast and ovarian cancer testing, and chemoprevention and prophylactic surgery. Differences across cities persist in the multivariate analysis, suggesting that attitudes towards preventive measures may be partially explained by cultural factors. Different dimensions of culture are discussed including the social representation of health and risk, the interpretation of scientific evidence and the role of innovation leadership."
Can we prevent BRCA1-associated breast cancer by RANKL inhibition?,"Kotsopoulos, Singer, Narod","Journal Article, Review, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27783278/,"BRCA1 mutation carriers face a high lifetime risk of breast cancer, estimated at 60% compared to 10% in the general population. At present, primary prevention is limited to prophylactic removal of unaffected breasts. Denosumab is an anti-RANKL monoclonal antibody which is approved to treat osteoporosis.","BRCA1 mutation carriers face a high lifetime risk of breast cancer, estimated at 60 % compared to 10 % in the general population. BRCA1 breast cancers typically have an aggressive course (i.e., high-grade, triple-negative) and are associated with a poor prognosis. At present, primary prevention is limited to prophylactic removal of the unaffected breasts. Effective chemopreventive strategies are not yet available. Emerging evidence suggests that BRCA1 mutation carriers have high circulating levels of progesterone which may play a role in their susceptibility to breast cancer. Recently, the RANK/RANKL system was found to be dysregulated in women with a BRCA1 mutation. Mutation carriers had significantly lower endogenous levels of osteoprotegerin (OPG) than women without a BRCA1 mutation. OPG is an endogenous decoy receptor for RANKL and inhibits RANKL-mediated signaling. RANKL binds to RANK on mammary epithelial cells and stimulates their proliferation and maturation. Low OPG levels may contribute to mammary tumorigenesis through increased proliferation and may explain in part the increased breast cancer risk in BRCA1 mutation carriers. Denosumab is an anti-RANKL monoclonal antibody which is approved to treat osteoporosis and to prevent skeletal damage caused by bone metastases. The emerging role of aberrant RANK-signaling in BRCA1 tumorigenesis suggests that targeting of RANKL may prevent breast cancer among women with germline BRCA1 mutations. Clinical investigations of denosumab are warranted and may lead to a novel chemopreventive approach for breast cancer for high-risk women."
Retinoids in cancer chemoprevention.,"Okuno, Kojima, Matsushima-Nishiwaki, Tsurumi, Muto, Friedman, Moriwaki","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15134535/,"Retinoids are prime candidates for cancer chemoprevention since cancer is characterized by abnormal growth with a lack of differentiation. Retinoids exert their biological functions through nuclear receptors, retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (XR) A number of experimental and clinical studies have been performed in the past two decades with retinoids.","We review the therapeutic and preventive applications of a retinoid analog (vitamin A and its derivatives) for human cancers. Chemoprevention of cancer is an intervention in the carcinogenic process by chemical agents that block or reverse the malignant transformation of cells. Retinoids are prime candidates for cancer chemoprevention since cancer is characterized by abnormal growth with a lack of differentiation, which could be modified by retinoids. Retinoids exert their biological functions through nuclear receptors, retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR). A number of experimental and clinical studies have been performed in the past two decades with retinoids showing that they inhibit or reverse the carcinogenic process in some organs, including hematological malignancy as well as premalignant and malignant lesions in the oral cavity, head and neck, breast, skin and liver. We particularly focus upon the therapeutic application of all-trans RA (atRA) to acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and on the preventive approach to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by a synthetic retinoid analog, acyclic retinoid. In both malignancies, malfunction of retinoid nuclear receptors is closely related to their carcinogenic process. In APL, a chromosomal translocation produces a chimeric protein between RAR alpha and a protein called promyelocyte leukemia protein (PML). PML-RAR alpha works as a dominant negative receptor in the leukemic cells, interfering with the normal function of RAR alpha and/or PML, which in turn results in the arrest of cell maturation at the stage of promyelocytes. Oral administration of atRA induces differentiation of promyelocytic leukemic cells to mature neutrophils, and leads to a high rates (over 90%) of complete remission. AtRA therapy has become standard in the treatment of APL. In the case of HCC, post-translational modification of RXR by phosphorylation impairs its function, which leads to uncontrolled cell growth. Acyclic retinoid suppresses the phosphorylation of RXR alpha, restores its function in the presence of its endogenous ligand, 9-cis RA, and thereby induces apoptosis of the cancer cells. Acyclic retinoid given orally successfully suppresses the development of second primary tumors in cirrhotic patients who undergo curative removal of preceding HCC. Eradication of (pre)malignant clones ('clonal deletion') from the liver is suggested as a mechanism of the chemopreventive effect. Further development of more effective retinoids as well as their use in combination with other classes of anticancer agents including immunopreventive drugs like interferons may provide strategies for cancer prevention."

Selective estrogen-receptor modulators (SERMs) are the current mainstay for primary prevention of breast cancer. As an alternative, exemestane, an aromatase inhibitor, has been evaluated for breast cancer prevention in postmenopausal women. A study of 4560 high-risk postmenopausal women taking exemestane 25 mg daily for a median of three years found a 65% relative reduction in the annual occurrence of invasive breast cancer compared with placebo (0.19% versus 0.55%; hazard ratio, 0.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.18-0.70; p = 0.002) and a 53% reduction in invasive plus noninvasive breast cancer (0.35% versus 0.77%; hazard ratio, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.27-0.79; p = 0.04). Adverse effects from exemestane are generally mild, with the most common being diarrhea, joint pain, and menopausal-related symptoms. Importantly, exemestane did not increase the risks of endometrial cancers, thromboembolism, cardiovascular events, or cataracts. However, joint stiffness and arthralgia were more common when compared with tamoxifen or raloxifene. Ongoing clinical trials with other aromatase inhibitors are underway to evaluate the benefits and long-term skeletal risks. Exemestane 25 mg daily taken for at least three years is a new option for the prevention of breast cancer in high-risk postmenopausal women. Indirectly compared with SERMs, exemestane has a similar frequency of bothersome adverse effects without the risk of thromboembolic events or endometrial cancer, though an increased risk of osteoporosis is of concern."

Germline mutations of the cancer-susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 seem to be the major aetiology of the HBOC. Genetic counselling and identification of high-risk families may be essential (1) to provide the best method for genetic testing by explaining the sensitivity and specificity of the methods, (2) to offer the opportunity to participate in specific early cancer detection programmes (breast (self) palpation, ultrasound, mammography and magnetic resonance tomography for breast cancer; vaginal exploration and ultrasound for ovarian cancer), (3) to inform them about prophylactic medication (oral contraceptive pill (OCP), chemoprevention (tamoxifen, raloxifen, aromatase inhibitors)) or surgery (bilateral prophylactic mastectomy or oophorectomy) and (4) to provide individualized psychological support. To fulfil these broad demands, an inter-disciplinary counselling approach (gynaecological oncology, human genetics, molecular biology, psychotherapy) in the setting of a cancer genetic clinic seems the most appropriate. There, participation in predictive genetic testing or the use of preventive or therapeutic options may be discussed extensively with the subjects. In particular, preventive options are emotionally disturbing for the subjects, and in cases of previous cancer. BC chemoprevention for high-risk women does not seem to be as effective as expected. However, OCP reduces the risk for OC. For prophylactic surgery, various points have to be considered, including: (1) individual risk assessment and gain in life expectancy, (2) value of screening and early detection methods or medical prevention, (3) disease characteristics and prognosis, and (4) anxiety and quality of life. Decisions regarding these options have to be individualized and psychological support must be offered during the period of decision and follow-up."

The Breast Cancer Prevention Trial (BCPT, P-1) demonstrated that tamoxifen can reduce the incidence of both invasive and noninvasive breast cancer as well as of bone fractures in women at increased risk. These benefits accrue at the expense of increased risk of endometrial cancer, thromboses, cataracts, and possibly diminished quality of life in postmenopausal women.

The trial is designed to recruit a total of 22,000 postmenopausal women and is powered to demonstrate superior efficacy of either agent or their equivalence in reducing the incidence of primary breast cancer. Additional end points will include the incidence of cardiovascular events and bone fractures. Thromboembolic events and endometrial cancer are the predicted toxicities. Ancillary studies of cognitive function will also be performed. Raloxifene should not be used for the reduction of breast cancer risk outside the context of the STAR trial."

Currently, there is increasing interest in the role of epigenetic biomarkers such as genomic methylation signatures, plasma microRNAs, and alterations in cell-signaling pathways in the diagnosis and primary prevention of breast cancer, as well as its prognosis. Polyphenols like natural stilbenes have been shown to be effective in chemoprevention by exerting cytotoxic effects that can stall cell proliferation. Besides possessing antioxidant properties against the DNA-damaging effects of reactive oxygen species, stilbenes have also been observed to modulate cell-signaling pathways. With the increasing trend of early-life screening for hereditary breast cancer risks, the potency of different phytochemicals in harnessing the epigenetic biomarkers of breast cancer risk demand more investigation. This review will explore means of exploiting the abilities of stilbenes in altering the underlying factors that influence breast cancer risk, as well as the appearance of associated biomarkers."
[Curcumin in chemoprevention of breast cancer].,"Terlikowska, Witkowska, Terlikowski","Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24864107/,"Breast cancer is the most common malignant cancer among women, both in Poland and worldwide.

Due to the constantly increasing number of breast cancer cases, it is vital to develop effective activities in primary and secondary prevention. One of the promising methods of best value, connecting both types of cancer prevention, appears to be chemoprevention. Chemoprevention uses natural or synthetic compounds to inhibit, delay or reverse the process of carcinogenesis. Among ingredients of natural origin, great attention is paid to curcumin - a broad-spectrum anti-cancer polyphenol derivative, extracted from the rhizome of Curcuma longa L. Curcumin has a number of chemopreventive properties such as anti-inflammatory activity, induction of apoptosis, inhibition of angiogenesis as well as tumor metastasis. Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated the mentioned anti-cancer effect in the epithelial breast cell line MCF-10A and in the epithelial breast cell lines MCF-7, BT-474, SK-BR-3-hr and MDA-MB-231. The main problem associated with the use of curcumin as a chemopreventive agent in humans is its low absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, poor solubility in body fluids and low bioavailability. Current studies are underway to increase the bioavailability and effectiveness of curcumin in vivo. Good results in the prevention and the treatment of breast cancer could be ensured by curcumin nanoparticles coated with albumin, known as nanocurcumin. The studies using nanocurcumin, however, are still in the preclinical stage, which is why there is a need to conduct extensive long-term randomized clinical trials to determine its effectiveness."
Predicting 10-year breast cancer mortality risk in the general female population in England: a model development and validation study.,"Clift, Collins, Lord, Petrou, Dodwell, Brady, Hippisley-Cox","Meta-Analysis, Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37625895/,Identifying female individuals at highest risk of developing life-threatening breast cancers could inform novel stratified early detection and prevention strategies.

We aimed to develop a prognostic model that accurately predicts the 10-year risk of breast cancer mortality in female individuals without breast cancer at baseline. In this model development and validation study, we used an open cohort study from the QResearch primary care database, which was linked to secondary care and national cancer and mortality registers in England, UK. The data extracted were from female individuals aged 20-90 years without previous breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ who entered the cohort between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2020. The primary outcome was breast cancer-related death, which was assessed in the full dataset. Cox proportional hazards, competing risks regression, XGBoost, and neural network modelling approaches were used to predict the risk of breast cancer death within 10 years using routinely collected health-care data. Death due to causes other than breast cancer was the competing risk. Internal-external validation was used to evaluate prognostic model performance (using Harrell's C, calibration slope, and calibration in the large), performance heterogeneity, and transportability. Internal-external validation involved dataset partitioning by time period and geographical region. Decision curve analysis was used to assess clinical utility. We identified data for 11 626 969 female individuals, with 70 095 574 person-years of follow-up. There were 142 712 (1·2%) diagnoses of breast cancer, 24 043 (0·2%) breast cancer-related deaths, and 696 106 (6·0%) deaths from other causes. Meta-analysis pooled estimates of Harrell's C were highest for the competing risks model (0·932, 95% CI 0·917-0·946). The competing risks model was well calibrated overall (slope 1·011, 95% CI 0·978-1·044), and across different ethnic groups. Decision curve analysis suggested favourable clinical utility across all age groups. The XGBoost and neural network models had variable performance across age and ethnic groups. A model that predicts the combined risk of developing and then dying from breast cancer at the population level could inform stratified screening or chemoprevention strategies. Further evaluation of the competing risks model should comprise effect and health economic assessment of model-informed strategies. Cancer Research UK."

Screening studies with magnetic resonance imaging of the breast are promising but the technology is not widespread and MRI is unlikely to be available as a screening tool in the near future. Prophylactic oophorectomy and mastectomy are effective preventive measures and are gaining in acceptance by patients and physicians. Preventive mastectomy is effective against both primary and contralateral breast cancer. Oophorectomy prevents ovarian cancer, and if done prior to menopause, will prevent breast cancer as well. Tamoxifen has been shown to prevent contralateral breast cancers in BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers but is not widely accepted as a means of primary prevention. Oral contraceptives and tubal ligation will reduce the risk of hereditary ovarian cancer and should be considered in women who wish to retain ovarian function."

This would warrant a significant change in practice, yet the acceptability from a woman's perspective has never been systematically explored. In this systematic review, we inventoried and appraised studies of women's perceptions of risk-based breast cancer screening and prevention to identify factors associated with adopting this new paradigm. We searched Medline, Embase and PsycInfo to identify original articles in English containing perceptions of risk-based breast cancer screening and/or primary prevention of women with an average to above average risk of developing breast cancer. Qualitative data were systematically extracted and referenced against four theoretical models of preventative health behaviour adoption. When considering the adoption of this novel screening and prevention programme, women carefully review their perceived susceptibility to breast cancer. Their decisions are based on a cost-benefit analysis of adopting lifestyle changes, chemoprevention, or prophylactic surgery, taking into account their perceived competence, individual autonomy, relatedness to others, and personal preference. The role of intent is limited when considering behavioural change. Implementing risk-based breast cancer screening and prevention will require a multifactorial approach. The transition from theory to practice can be supported by developing evidence-based shared decision aids and family-oriented (genetic) counselling programmes."
The retinoids and cancer prevention mechanisms.,"Dragnev, Rigas, Dmitrovsky","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S., Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11040271/,"Chemoprevention strategies represent therapeutic interventions at early stages of carcinogenesis, before the onset of invasive cancer. Derivatives of vitamin A, the retinoids, have reported activity in treating premalignant lesions.","Carcinogenesis is a multistep process that converts normal cells into malignant cells. Once transformed, malignant cells acquire the ability to invade and metastasize, leading to clinically evident disease. During this continuum from normal to metastatic cells, carcinogenic steps can be arrested or reversed through pharmacological treatments, known as cancer chemoprevention. Chemoprevention strategies represent therapeutic interventions at early stages of carcinogenesis, before the onset of invasive cancer. Effective chemoprevention should reduce or avoid the clinical consequences of overt malignancies by treating early neoplastic lesions before development of clinically apparent signs or symptoms. Preclinical, clinical, and epidemiological data provide considerable support for cancer chemoprevention as an attractive therapeutic strategy. This clinical approach was validated in the recent tamoxifen randomized trial, demonstrating that a selective estrogen receptor modulator reduces the risk of breast cancer in women at high risk for this malignancy. Derivatives of vitamin A, the retinoids, have reported activity in treating specific premalignant lesions and reducing incidence of second primary tumors in patients with prior head and neck, lung or liver cancers. Whether the retinoids will prevent primary cancers at these sites is not yet known. Notably, a carotenoid (beta-carotene) was shown as inactive in primary prevention of lung cancers in high-risk individuals. This underscores the need for relevant in vitro models to identify pathways signaling chemopreventive effects. These models should assess the activity of candidate chemoprevention agents before the conduct of large and costly prevention trials. An improved understanding of cancer prevention mechanisms should aid in the discovery of new therapeutic targets and chemoprevention agents. Ideally, these agents should have tolerable clinical toxicities suitable for chronic administration to individuals at high risk for developing primary or second cancers. This article reviews what is now known from clinical and preclinical studies about the retinoids as cancer prevention agents."

Substantial advances have been accomplished in the last decade, especially for primary and secondary prevention of breast cancer. In addition to tamoxifen, raloxifene and other selective estrogen receptor modulators, retinoids are among the most promising agents, given their ability to inhibit mammary carcinogenesis in preclinical models. Fenretinide, the synthetic amide of retinoic acid, inhibits cell growth mostly through the induction of apoptosis with mechanisms which may partly involve the retinoid receptors. Because it has a favourable toxicological profile, fenretinide has been extensively investigated in clinical trials. A large randomised phase III trial for secondary breast cancer prevention has been recently carried out in Italy. Results showed a reduction of second breast malignancies in premenopausal women. In addition, a significant decrease of circulating insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, a known risk factor for premenopausal breast cancer, was observed after 1 year of fenretinide administration in premenopausal women with breast cancer. Ongoing studies on the validation of the circulating IGF-1 as a surrogate endpoint biomarker of fenretinide activity and on the effectiveness of the combination with low dose tamoxifen may provide further insight into the future clinical application of fenretinide."

Thus, raloxifene is being compared with tamoxifen in a phase III trial, while the minimal active dose of tamoxifen is being assessed in phase I-II trials. Also, the combination of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and tamoxifen may reduce the risks while retaining the benefits of either agent. Anastrozole holds promise as a preventive agent based on preliminary results on contralateral breast cancer. The identification of women at increased risk for estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer due to hormonal and reproductive factors may maximize the therapeutic index of hormonal agents. Finally, new targets that interfere with ER-negative breast carcinogenesis are being sought as one-third of breast cancers will not be preventable by hormonal interventions."

The utilization of a risk-based stratification model, genetic testing, and chemoprevention could decrease the incidence of invasive breast cancer but uptake has been low among high-risk women. The goal of this project was to implement a comprehensive informatics framework to promote breast cancer risk assessment and chemoprevention in the primary care setting that was informed by potential user feedback. The framework provides evidence-based decision support to both providers and patients. For providers we developed a novel breast cancer risk navigation (BNAV) tool which incorporates an evidence-based breast cancer risk model into the electronic health record. For patients a decision aid was designed that allows participants to experience risk through an activity and to address patient-related barriers to chemoprevention. We conducted usability testing to determine barriers and facilitators affecting the toolbox use by providers. A total of seven subjects were recruited and completed the usability testing. Using think-aloud protocols, semi-structured interviews, and subject recordings, we identified recurring themes related to the usability of BNAV. Themes specifically aligned with the content, ease of use, and navigation of the application. This feedback was used to make interface changes to the application that more appropriately tailored BNAV to engage the target population of primary care providers and thus more effectively optimizing shared decision-making associated with breast cancer risk assessment and prevention in clinical practice. A comprehensive informatics framework to increase breast cancer risk assessment and chemoprevention in the primary care setting has been successfully introduced to address this challenge. Given the proven efficacy of breast cancer chemoprevention in high-risk populations, higher uptake may significantly reduce the public health burden of this disease."

Obesity is linked with several health disorders such as hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, Type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia and certain cancers. Currently, obesity-related malignancies, e.g., cancers of the breast, prostate and colon are the leading cancers in the industrialized societies. An increased amount of fat or adipose tissue in an overweight or obese person probably influences the development of cancer by releasing several hormone-like factors or adipokines. The majority of adipokines are pro-inflammatory, which promote pathological conditions like insulin resistance and cancer. On the other hand, many recent studies have shown that adiponectin, an anti-inflammatory adipokine, has anti-cancer and insulin-sensitizing effects. Adiponectin exerts its physiological functions chiefly by activation of AMP kinase via adiponectin receptors. Interestingly, several fruits and vegetables may contain adiponectin-like molecules or may increase the biosynthesis of adiponectin in our body. Studies on adiponectin analogues or adiponectin receptor agonists are a promising area of cancer chemoprevention research. In general, fruits and vegetables contain various dietary substances such as vitamins, minerals (like calcium and selenium), fiber and phytochemicals or phenolic compounds (like flavonoids and vanilloids), which may act as anti-cancer agents. Similarly, several dietary constituents including phytochemicals may have anti-obesity effects. Consumption of such dietary compounds along with caloric restriction and physical activity may be helpful in preventing obesity-related cancers.

Until recently, there was little hope that these goals could be attained. However, the results achieved with tamoxifen in the prevention of breast cancer, and the emergence of new therapies specifically targeted to molecules involved in the pathogenesis of lung cancer have set the stage for investigation of these agents for chemoprevention of lung cancer. Two of these new molecular targeted agents are gefitinib, an inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase activity, and tipifarnib (R115777, Zarnestra ), an inhibitor of the farnesyltransferase enzyme, which is required for the proper localization and function of the ras oncogene. Tumor responses and disease stabilization have been achieved with both agents in clinical trials.

These trials should provide information not only about the potential role of gefitinib and tipifarnib in lung cancer chemoprevention, but also about the molecular changes that underlie tumorigenesis and that may serve as markers of disease progression. The STOP trial objectives are to evaluate the effect of gefitinib and tipifarnib on histologic and biologic parameters in patients with evidence of sputum atypia, to evaluate various parameters as potential predictors of the effectiveness of these agents, and to evaluate the tolerability of these agents over a 6-month course of treatment. Histologic response, defined as prevention of appearance or progression of premalignant lesions, is the primary endpoint of these trials.

High-dose retinoids have been shown to be active against oral premalignant lesions.,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is a devastating disease with a poor outcome in advanced stages, accounting for approximately 3% of all malignancies, with an estimated 37200 new cases and 11000 deaths annually in the U.S. Second primary tumors are estimated to occur at an annual rate of 3%-10% and are significant threats to long-term survivors. Chemoprevention is an appealing strategy, and its success has been demonstrated in breast cancer and familial adenomatous polyposis. High-dose retinoids have been shown to be active against oral premalignant lesions and in prevention of second primary tumors in the head and neck. New targets include the epidermal growth factor receptor, cyclooxygenase-2, and other molecular targets. Challenges in future head and neck cancer chemoprevention investigations include achieving long-lasting efficacy with retinoids and/or new agents, and determining the optimal dose and duration of therapy while maintaining acceptable toxicities."
Risk factors and risk reduction of breast and ovarian cancer.,Brekelmans,"Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12544504/,"Breast and ovarian cancer remain a significant burden for women living in the Western world. Established factors associated with the risk of breast cancer include family history, reproductive factors and lactation. Hormone replacement therapy increases the risk, whereas oral contraceptives probably confer no increased risk.","Breast and ovarian cancer remain a significant burden for women living in the Western world. This paper reviews the risk factors and current strategies to prevent these diseases. Established factors associated with the risk of breast cancer include family history, reproductive factors and lactation, as well as age at menarche and menopause. Hormone replacement therapy increases the risk, whereas oral contraceptives probably confer no increased risk. Alcohol moderately increases the risk, whereas a diet rich in folate and carotenoids might be protective. The role of other dietary factors, smoking and physical exercise remain unclear. Important risk factors for ovarian cancer are reproductive factors and possibly the long-term use of hormone replacement therapy. The risk is decreased by oral contraceptives. In carriers of a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation, prophylactic surgery can significantly reduce the risk of breast as well as ovarian cancer. Tamoxifen may be considered as a chemopreventive agent in women with a high risk of breast cancer, including carriers of a BRCA2 mutation, but is probably not effective in BRCA1 carriers. During the period of this review, the importance of several known risk factors was confirmed, whereas the effects of other factors became more clear. Chemoprevention and prophylactic surgery have emerged as preventative options that can reduce the risk of breast and ovarian cancer."
Risk versus Benefit of Chemoprevention among Raloxifene and Tamoxifen Users with a Family History of Breast Cancer.,"Anderson, Nichols, House, Sandler","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31431499/,Tamoxifen and raloxifene have been approved for the primary prevention of breast cancer in high-risk women. The drugs are associated with an increased risk of serious side effects. Few studies have characterized risk-benefit profiles for chemoprevention.,"Tamoxifen and raloxifene have been approved for the primary prevention of breast cancer in high-risk women, but are associated with an increased risk of serious side effects. Few studies have characterized risk-benefit profiles for chemoprevention among women who initiate tamoxifen or raloxifene outside of a clinical trial setting. Use of raloxifene and tamoxifen for chemoprevention was self-reported in 2014 to 2016 by participants in The Sister Study, a prospective cohort of women with a sister who had been diagnosed with breast cancer. After exclusions, 432 current raloxifene users and 96 current tamoxifen users were matched to 4,307 and 953 nonusers, respectively, on age and year of cohort enrollment. Conditional logistic regression was used to evaluate characteristics associated with chemoprevention use. Risk-benefit profiles were examined using published indices that assess the level of evidence (none, moderate, strong) that the benefits of chemoprevention outweigh the risk of serious side effects. Among current chemoprevention users, 44% of tamoxifen users and 5% of raloxifene users had no evidence of a net benefit. In analyses of factors associated with chemoprevention use, having strong evidence of benefit was a significant predictor of raloxifene use, but not of tamoxifen use. In our sample of women with a first-degree family history of breast cancer, raloxifene was more commonly used for breast cancer prevention than tamoxifen. Most raloxifene users, but <60% of tamoxifen users, were likely to benefit. Use of risk-benefit tables can help women and their healthcare providers make an informed decision about breast cancer chemoprevention."
Novel routes for administering chemoprevention: local transdermal therapy to the breasts.,"Lee, Khan","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26970129/,"Local transdermal therapy (LTT) involves the application of active drugs to the breast skin, resulting in high concentrations in the breast but low systemic exposure. LTT decreases proliferation of invasive and non-invasive cancer cells to a similar degree as oral tamoxifen, with low systemic levels.","Breast cancer prevention with pharmacologic agents requires that the breast be exposed to an effective drug; systemic exposure is unnecessary, and its harms lead many eligible women to decline preventive therapy. Local transdermal therapy (LTT) to the breast involves the application of active drugs to the breast skin, resulting in high concentrations in the breast but low systemic exposure. It is non-invasive, self-delivered, and not dependent on hepatic metabolism. Existing data on LTT include investigations demonstrating relief of mastalgia with topical 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT, an active tamoxifen metabolite). Two presurgical window trials in women with invasive breast cancer, and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) demonstrate that LTT decreases proliferation of invasive and non-invasive cancer cells to a similar degree as oral tamoxifen, with low systemic levels, and no effect on coagulation proteins. These data are promising regarding the use of LTT for the primary prevention of breast cancer, and for therapy of DCIS, since systemic exposure is not required for either of these purposes. They also suggest that an LTT approach could be developed for any small, lipophilic molecule with good dermal permeation, thus greatly expanding the menu of drugs that could be tested for breast cancer prevention."

Our group has used the 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) mouse model of carcinogen-induced breast cancer to explore the clinical potential of two tyrosine kinase inhibitors and a nucleoside analog as chemopreventive agents. All three agents exhibited promising preclinical activity both as monotherapy and as components of combination therapy with the standard chemotherapy drug paclitaxel. The tumors developing despite chemoprevention were not only small and grew slowly, but they also displayed a uniquely more pro-apoptotic protein expression profile. Hence, our experimental chemopreventive drugs were capable of preventing the development of aggressive mammary gland tumors with an apoptosis-resistant protein expression profile."

Risks and benefits of retinoids in the chemoprevention of cancer.,"de Palo, Formelli","Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8573297/,"Chemoprevention of cancer is a new branch of clinical research. Among the various chemical or natural compounds used as chemopreventive agents, retinoids appear to be one of the most promising groups of agents.

In the last few years, this area of research has progressed dramatically from preclinical studies to phase I, II and III clinical trials. Among the various chemical or natural compounds used as chemopreventive agents, retinoids appear to be one of the most promising groups of agents. Analyses of preclinical and clinical studies have shown retinoids to be active in reversing skin and oral precancer, in preventing primary skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer, and second primary tumours associated with head and neck and lung cancers. Preclinical studies have shown evidence of the activity of fenretinide in breast cancer. Preliminary clinical data seem to show a protective effect of fenretinide against ovarian cancer. Current evidence therefore suggests that chemoprevention of cancer with retinoids is a promising path."
Breast Cancer Chemoprevention: A Network Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"Mocellin, Pilati, Briarava, Nitti","Journal Article, Meta-Analysis",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26582062/,"Several agents have been advocated for breast cancer primary prevention. Few of them appear effective, the associated severe adverse effects limiting their uptake. Aromatase inhibitors and tamoxifen ranked second and third, respectively. New selective estrogen receptor modulators have the best benefit-risk ratio.","Several agents have been advocated for breast cancer primary prevention. However, few of them appear effective, the associated severe adverse effects limiting their uptake. We performed a comprehensive search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting on the ability of chemoprevention agents (CPAs) to reduce the incidence of primary breast carcinoma. Using network meta-analysis, we ranked CPAs based simultaneously on efficacy and acceptability (an inverse measure of toxicity). All statistical tests were two-sided. We found 48 eligible RCTs, enrolling 271 161 women randomly assigned to receive either placebo or one of 21 CPAs. Aromatase inhibitors (anastrozole and exemestane, considered a single CPA class because of the lack of between-study heterogeneity; relative risk [RR] = 0.468, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.346 to 0.634), arzoxifene (RR = 0.415, 95% CI = 0.253 to 0.682), lasofoxifene (RR = 0.208, 95% CI = 0.079 to 0.544), raloxifene (RR = 0.572, 95% CI = 0.372 to 0.881), tamoxifen (RR = 0.708, 95% CI = 0.595 to 0.842), and tibolone (RR = 0.317, 95% CI = 0.127 to 0.792) were statistically significantly associated with a therapeutic effect, which was restricted to estrogen receptor-positive tumors of postmenopausal women (except for tamoxifen, which is active also during premenopause). Network meta-analysis ranking showed that the new selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) arzoxifene, lasofoxifene, and raloxifene have the best benefit-risk ratio. Aromatase inhibitors and tamoxifen ranked second and third, respectively. These results provide physicians and health care regulatory agencies with RCT-based evidence on efficacy and acceptability of currently available breast cancer CPAs; at the same time, we pinpoint how much work still remains to be done before pharmacological primary prevention becomes a routine option to reduce the burden of this disease."
Cancer chemoprevention by supplemental carotenoids in animals and humans.,"Santamaria, Bianchi","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2694158/,"Dietary carotenoids (beta-carotene or canthaxanthin) have a protective effect against indirect skin carcinogenesis induced by benzo[a]pyrene +/- UVA and breast cancer induced by 8-methoxypsoralen + UVA. This type of prevention can be envisaged in organs like the lung, urinary bladder, breast, stomach and colon-rectum.","Experiments were carried out in mice demonstrating that dietary carotenoids (beta-carotene or canthaxanthin), starting before cancer initiation and continuing throughout the experiment, have a protective effect against indirect skin carcinogenesis induced by benzo[a]pyrene +/- UVA and breast cancer induced by 8-methoxypsoralen + UVA. Experiments in rats demonstrated that carotenoids also prevent the direct gastric carcinogenesis induced by N-methyl-N'-nitro-nitroso-guanidine. Recently, prevention by beta-carotene against colon cancer induced in mice by dimethylhydrazine, another indirect carcinogen, was confirmed by others. The prospects for carotenoid intervention with humans were based on their antitumorigenic effect, which is quite independent of pro-vitamin A activity, their lack of toxicity even after prolonged administration, and their immunostimulating activity. These facts helped to build up a rationale predicting that any epithelial cancer, after radical surgery, can be chemoprevented with supplemental carotenoids. Thus, it is expected that the remaining initiated epithelial tissue will be protected by quenching oxygen radical formation, against the onset of a second primary malignancy. This type of prevention can be envisaged in organs like the lung, urinary bladder, breast, stomach, and colon-rectum. At present, human intervention protocols with a randomized drug/placebo method are underway under the supervision of the Centro Tumori of Pavia to chemoprevent with beta-carotene second primary lung or bladder cancer after radical surgery. Preliminary observations regarding findings in humans without randomization (1980-1988) in Pavia are also reported here. This consisted of chemoprevention with beta-carotene plus canthaxanthin against recurrence of different epithelial malignancies after radical treatment (surgery +/- chemoradiotherapy). None of the 11 cases recruited, on the basis of radical nature of treatment and patient adherence, have shown any recurrence beyond their expected disease-free intervals."
Use of the Gail model and breast cancer preventive therapy among three primary care specialties.,"Corbelli, Borrero, Bonnema, McNamara, Kraemer, Rubio, Karpov, McNeil","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25115368/,Only 40% of providers report having used the Gail model to assess breast cancer risk. 13% report having recommended or prescribed chemoprevention. Lack of both time and familiarity were commonly cited barriers to use.,"Breast cancer is an issue of serious concern among women of all ages. The extent to which providers across primary care specialties assess breast cancer risk and discuss chemoprevention is unknown. Cross-sectional web-based survey completed by 316 physicians in internal medicine (IM), family medicine (FM), and gynecology (GYN) from February to April of 2012. Survey items assessed respondents' frequency of use of the Gail model and chemoprevention, and their attitudes behind practice patterns. Descriptive statistics were used to generate response distributions, and chi-squared tests were used to compare responses among specialties. The response rate was 55.0 % (316/575). Only 40% of providers report having used the Gail model (37% IM, 33% FM, 60% GYN) and 13% report having recommended or prescribed chemoprevention (9% IM, 8% FM, 30% GYN). Among providers who use the Gail model, a minority use it regularly in patients who may be at increased breast cancer risk. Among providers who have prescribed chemoprevention, most have done so five times or fewer. Lack of both time and familiarity were commonly cited barriers to use of the Gail score and chemoprevention. An overall minority of providers, most notably in FM and IM, use the Gail model to assess, and chemoprevention to decrease, breast cancer risk. Until providers are more consistent in their use of the Gail model (or other breast cancer risk calculator) and chemoprevention, opportunities to intervene in women at increased risk will likely continue to be missed."

This warrants further research on the mechanisms of action and potential efficacy of fenretinide and provides the rationale for a Phase III primary prevention trial in young women at high risk for breast cancer. This review will highlight the role of fenretinide in breast cancer chemoprevention."
β-Sitosterol as a Promising Anticancer Agent for Chemoprevention and Chemotherapy: Mechanisms of Action and Future Prospects.,"Wang, Wang, Zhang, Liu, Hong","Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37247842/,"Cancer is one of the primary causes of death worldwide, and its incidence continues to increase yearly. The search for effective and nontoxic preventive and therapeutic agents remains greatly important. β-Sitosterol (SIT), the most abundant phytosterol found in various plant foods, represents such an option.","Cancer is one of the primary causes of death worldwide, and its incidence continues to increase yearly. Despite significant advances in research, the search for effective and nontoxic preventive and therapeutic agents remains greatly important. Cancer is a multimodal disease, where various mechanisms play significant roles in its occurrence and progression. This highlights the need for multitargeted approaches that are not only safe and inexpensive but also provide effective alternatives for current therapeutic regimens. β-Sitosterol (SIT), the most abundant phytosterol found in various plant foods, represents such an option. Preclinical evidence over the past few decades has overwhelmingly shown that SIT exhibits multiple anticancer activities against varied cancers, such as liver, cervical, colon, stomach, breast, lung, pancreatic, and prostate cancers, in addition to leukemia, multiple myeloma, melanoma, and fibrosarcoma. In this article, we present the latest advances and perspectives on SIT-systematically summarizing its antitumor mechanisms of action into 7 main sections and combining current challenges and prospects-for its use as a promising agent for cancer prevention and treatment. In particular, SIT plays a role in cancer prevention and treatment mainly by enhancing apoptosis, inducing cell cycle arrest, bidirectionally regulating oxidative stress, improving metabolic reprogramming, inhibiting invasion and metastasis, modulating immunity and inflammation, and combating drug resistance. Although SIT holds such great promise, the poor aqueous solubility and bioavailability coupled with low targeting efficacy limit its therapeutic efficacy and clinical application. Further research on novel drug delivery systems may improve these deficiencies. Overall, through complex and pleiotropic mechanisms, SIT has good potential for tumor chemoprevention and chemotherapy. However, no clinical trials have yet proven this potential. This review provides theoretical basis and rationality for the further design and conduct of clinical trials to confirm the anticancer activity of SIT."

Retinoids in cancer treatment.,"Tallman, Wiernik","Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1447394/,"Vitamin A and its derivatives (retinoids) have served as paradigms for experimental studies exploring the pharmacologic modification of carcinogenesis. Prohibitive toxicity of the parent compound, vitamin A, led to a systematic search for synthetic derivatives with an improved therapeutic index.","Since initial studies identifying the important role of vitamin A and its derivatives (retinoids) in maintaining the integrity of epithelial tissues, these compounds have served as paradigms for experimental studies exploring the pharmacologic modification of carcinogenesis. Retinoids have clearly been shown to inhibit chemically induced mammary and urothelial carcinogenesis in experimental animals. Prohibitive toxicity of the parent compound, vitamin A, led to a systematic search for synthetic derivatives with an improved therapeutic index. More than 1500 such compounds have been synthesized, many retaining chemopreventive potential, but with less toxicity. Although several anecdotal reports confirming therapeutic benefits of cis-retinoic acid in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes appeared in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the remarkable studies of Huang and his colleagues in China in 1988 reporting complete remissions in patients with this uncommon variety of acute myelogenous leukemia with the transisomer of retinoic acid (all-trans-retinoic acid) led to a resurgence of interest in the retinoids as differentiating agents for the prevention and therapy of cancer. Furthermore, molecular studies showing DNA rearrangements of the alpha nuclear receptor for retinoic acid located on chromosome 17 in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia, a disease invariably associated with a translocation between chromosomes 15 and 17, provided a direct connection between an altered nuclear receptor and the development of a human malignancy. The retinoids also may have important beneficial effects in prevention of recurrent malignancies once the primary tumor has been treated, such as in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Because retinoids appear to be less effective in inducing differentiation in nonpromyelocytic leukemia cells, investigators have conducted a number of studies to exploit potential synergism between retinoids and other differentiating agents or biologic effectors. Differentiation therapy and chemoprevention are attractive alternative approaches to intensive cytotoxic chemotherapy. It is now clear that retinoids represent one class of compounds with which it may be possible to reverse the progression of malignant disease and prevent carcinogenesis."

Our primary endpoint was incidence of all breast cancer (including ductal carcinoma in situ) during a 10 year follow-up period. Analysis was by intention to treat. We analysed data for 83,399 women with 306,617 women-years of follow-up. Median follow-up was 65 months (IQR 54-93). Overall, we noted a 38% reduction (hazard ratio [HR] 0·62, 95% CI 0·56-0·69) in breast cancer incidence, and 42 women would need to be treated to prevent one breast cancer event in the first 10 years of follow-up.

Thromboembolic events were significantly increased with all SERMs (odds ratio 1·73, 95% CI 1·47-2·05; p<0·0001). We recorded a significant reduction of 34% in vertebral fractures (0·66, 0·59-0·73), but only a small effect for non-vertebral fractures (0·93, 0·87-0·99). For all SERMs, incidence of invasive oestrogen (ER)-positive breast cancer was reduced both during treatment and for at least 5 years after completion. Similar to other preventive interventions, careful consideration of risks and benefits is needed to identify women who are most likely to benefit from these drugs. Cancer Research UK."

Reasons for its rapidly increasing incidence include the rising prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux and obesity, combined with the decreasing prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection. The strong male predominance remains unexplained, but hormonal influence might play an important role. Future prevention might include the treatment of reflux or obesity or chemoprevention with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or statins, but no evidence-based preventive measures are currently available. Likely future developments include endoscopic screening of better defined high-risk groups for EAC. Individuals with Barrett esophagus might benefit from surveillance, at least those with dysplasia, but screening and surveillance strategies need careful evaluation to be feasible and cost-effective. The surgery for EAC is more extensive than virtually any other standard procedure, and postoperative survival, health-related quality of life, and nutrition need to be improved (eg, by improved treatment, better decision-making, and more individually tailored follow-up). Promising clinical developments include increased survival after preoperative chemoradiotherapy, the potentially reduced impact on health-related quality of life after minimally invasive surgery, and the new endoscopic therapies for dysplastic Barrett esophagus or early EAC. The overall survival rates are improving slightly, but poor prognosis remains a challenge."

Surgery and chemoprevention remain the main risk-reducing modalities for those with hereditary cancer syndromes.,"Breast cancer (BC) prevention remains the ultimate cost-effective method to reduce the global burden of invasive breast cancer (IBC). To date, surgery and chemoprevention remain the main risk-reducing modalities for those with hereditary cancer syndromes, as well as high-risk non-hereditary breast lesions such as ADH, ALH, or LCIS. Ductal carcinoma <i>in situ</i> (DCIS) is a preinvasive malignant lesion of the breast that closely mirrors IBC and, if left untreated, develops into IBC in up to 50% of lesions. Certain high-risk patients with DCIS may have a 25% risk of developing recurrent DCIS or IBC, even after surgical resection. The development of breast cancer elicits a strong immune response, which brings to prominence the numerous advantages associated with immune-based cancer prevention over drug-based chemoprevention, supported by the success of dendritic cell vaccines targeting HER2-expressing BC. Vaccination against BC to prevent or interrupt the process of BC development remains elusive but is a viable option. Vaccination to intercept preinvasive or premalignant breast conditions may be possible by interrupting the expression pattern of various oncodrivers. Growth factors may also function as potential immune targets to prevent breast cancer progression. Furthermore, neoantigens also serve as effective targets for interception by virtue of strong immunogenicity. It is noteworthy that the immune response also needs to be strong enough to result in target lesion elimination to avoid immunoediting as it may occur in IBC arising from DCIS. Overall, if the issue of vaccine targets can be solved by interrupting premalignant lesions, there is a potential to prevent the development of IBC."

For breast cancer, different strategies for risk avoidance, chemopreventive measures and chemosuppressive interventions are being investigated. Attention is presently focused on two compounds, the synthetic retinoid fenretinide (4-HPR) and the antioestrogen tamoxifen, and their possible synergism. More data are now available on the expression and regulation of retinoic acid receptors in human breast cancer cells and on the consequences of the interaction of retinoids with plasma retinol binding protein. Mechanistic relationships between retinoids and growth factors like transforming growth factor-beta have been demonstrated in the frame of a central regulatory system of the state of differentiation and proliferation, in which tamoxifen is involved as well. Recent data from different trials using tamoxifen as adjuvant treatment have shown a decrease in the incidence of contralateral new primaries and that it could soon become unethical not to prescribe this drug to all node-negative oestrogen receptor-positive postmenopausal patients."

Tamoxifen does have side effects, however, including marginally increased risks of endometrial cancer and thromboembolic events. In this study, women at increased risk for breast cancer development were offered tamoxifen. Their knowledge of tamoxifen as a chemopreventive agent was assessed, and factors influencing their acceptance of tamoxifen and willingness to take it were determined. Forty-three patients were identified who qualified to take tamoxifen for primary prevention. Patients qualified by having at least a 1.7% 5-year risk of developing breast cancer, the criteria for entry into the NSABP P-1 trial. Patients initially completed questionnaires designed to assess their knowledge of tamoxifen and its associated risks and benefits. Patients were then provided neutral educational sessions and literature delineating the actual risks and benefits of tamoxifen. Subsequently, patients' decisions regarding taking tamoxifen were reassessed. Mean patient age was 52.8 years, with a range of 39 to 74 years. Ten patients (23.2%) qualified based on the presence of lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), seven patients (16.3%) qualified based on increased risk secondary to age >60 years, and 26 patients (60.5%) age range 35 to 59 qualified based on risk profiles demonstrating significantly increased risk. Of the total 43 patients, two (4.7%) elected to start taking tamoxifen. Fifteen patients (34.8%) declined immediately, and 26 patients (60.5%) were undecided initially but ultimately declined. Educational sessions did not influence patients' decisions. Fear of side effects, including endometrial cancer, thromboembolic events, and menopausal symptoms, was the most commonly cited reason for declining to take tamoxifen. In this study, the vast majority of patients at increased risk for breast cancer perceived that the risks of taking tamoxifen outweighed the benefits and declined to take it."

We determined the proportion of women aged 40 to 69 years attending general internal medicine practices who were potentially eligible for tamoxifen chemoprevention and calculated the maximum proportion of breast cancers that could be prevented. Six hundred five women aged 40 to 69 completed self-administered questionnaires in the waiting rooms of 10 general internal medicine practices in North Carolina in 2001. Among white women, 9.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.1%-15.2%) in their 40s, 24.0% (95% CI, 18.2%-31.0%) in their 50s, and 53.4% (95% CI, 46.1%-61.3%) in their 60s had a 5-year Gail model estimated breast cancer risk of 1.66% or greater.

When adverse events were considered in white women, 10% or fewer in all age groups were potentially eligible for chemoprevention. The maximum proportion of breast cancers prevented in eligible women was 6.0% to 8.3%. Small numbers of women in primary care practices are eligible for discussions about chemoprevention; the maximum proportion of breast cancers prevented if eligible women take tamoxifen is also small. Challenges lie in targeting discussions to the most appropriate women and in finding new chemoprevention strategies that have less risk of harms."

For mammary cancer studies, Sprague-Dawley rats were fed AIN-76A diet plus minus 250 mg genistein/kg diet. Dimethylbenz[a]anthracene was administered by gavage at d 50 postpartum to induce mammary tumors. Mammary cancer chemoprevention was demonstrated after prepubertal and combined prepubertal and adult genistein treatments but not after prenatal- or adult-only treatments, demonstrating that the timing of exposure to genistein is important for mammary cancer chemoprevention. The cellular mechanism of action was found to be mammary gland and cell differentiation, as shown by whole-mount analysis and beta-casein expression. An imprinting effect was shown for epidermal growth factor receptor expression in mammary terminal end buds. For prostate cancer studies, we used two models. The first was a chemically (N-methylnitrosourea) induced prostate cancer rat model. Genistein in the diet inhibited the development of invasive adenocarcinomas in a dose-dependent manner. The second model was a transgenic mouse model that resulted in spontaneously developing adenocarcinoma tumor of the prostate. Genistein in the diet reduced the incidence of poorly differentiated prostatic adenocarcinomas in a dose-dependent manner and down-regulated androgen receptor, estrogen receptor-alpha, progesterone receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor, insulin-like growth factor-I, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1 but not estrogen receptor-beta and transforming growth factor-alpha mRNA expressions. We conclude that dietary genistein protects against mammary and prostate cancers by regulating specific sex steroid receptors and growth factor signaling pathways."

Optimal primary febrile neutropenia prophylaxis for patients receiving docetaxel-cyclophosphamide chemotherapy for breast cancer: a systematic review.,"Fernandes, Mazzarello, Stober, Vandermeer, Dudani, Ibrahim, Majeed, Perdrizet, Shorr, Hutton, Fergusson, Clemons","Journal Article, Review, Systematic Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27783280/,Primary FN prophylaxis is recommended in breast cancer patients receiving DC chemotherapy. The optimal choice of G-CSF or antibiotics is unknown. A systematic review was performed to address this knowledge gap. Outcome measures evaluated included incidence of FN and treatment-related hospitalizations.,"Due to the high rate of febrile neutropenia (FN) with docetaxel-cyclophosphamide (DC) chemotherapy, primary FN prophylaxis is recommended. However, the optimal choice of prophylaxis [i.e., granulocyte-colony stimulating factors (G-CSF) or antibiotics] is unknown. A systematic review was performed to address this knowledge gap. Embase, Ovid Medline, Pubmed, the Cochrane database of systematic reviews, and Cochrane register of controlled trials were searched from 1946 to April 2016 for studies evaluating primary prophylactic FN treatments in breast cancer patients receiving DC chemotherapy. Outcome measures evaluated included: incidence of FN and treatment-related hospitalizations, chemotherapy dose reduction/delays/discontinuations, and adverse events. Screening and data collection were performed by two independent reviewers. Of 2105 identified records, 7 studies (n = 2535) met the pre-specified eligibility criteria. Seven additional studies (n = 621) were identified from prior systematic reviews. There were 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (n = 2256) and 11 retrospective studies (n = 900). Study sample sizes ranged from 30 to 982 patients (median 99.5), evaluating pegfilgrastim (n = 1274), filgrastim (n = 1758), and oral ciprofloxacin (n = 108). Given the heterogeneity of patients and study design, a narrative synthesis of results was performed. Median FN rates with and without primary prophylaxis were 6.6 % (IQR 3.9-10.6 %) and 31.3 % (IQR 25-33 %), respectively. No FN-related deaths were reported. No RCT directly compared G-CSF with antibiotic interventions. Primary FN prophylaxis reduces the incidence of FN. Despite considerable cost and toxicity differences between G-CSF and antibiotics, there is insufficient data to make a recommendation of one strategy over another."

Epidemiological and clinical aspects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and cancer risks.,Moran,"Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12086406/,NSAIDs have a beneficial effect of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in colon cancer prevention. This is chiefly due to the inhibition of the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes. Most cancer cells have been found to exhibit overexpression of COX-2.,"It is well known that about 70% of cancer cases are due to environmental, dietary, or lifestyle factors. Accordingly, these cases maybe avoided by appropriate modifications. In addition, active chemoprevention has become a major interventional approach following the epidemiological observation of a beneficial effect of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in colon cancer prevention. This is chiefly due to the inhibition of the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes. The COX enzymatic system includes two isoenzymes, COX-1 and COX-2, that convert arachidonic acid to prostaglandins. COX-1 is constitutively expressed and synthesizes cytoprotective prostaglandins in the gastrointestinal tract. COX-2 is inducible by the oncogenes ras and scr and other cytokines; it is overexpressed in human cancer cells in which it stimulates cellular division and angiogenesis and inhibits apoptosis. NSAIDs restore apoptosis and decrease tumor mitogenesis and angiogenesis. Most cancer cells have been found to exhibit overexpression of COX-2. Epidemiological studies showed a lower risk of developing cancer of the colon, breast, esophagus, and stomach following the ingestion of NSAIDs. The use of NSAIDs in low dose was associated with a statistically significant decrease in the risk of adenomatous polyps and of overt colon cancer. The regressive effects of sulindac on foci of aberrant crypts in the colon (considered to be precursors of adenoma), and on adenocarcinoma of the colon, are of particular interest because this NSAID does not have an inhibitory effect on COX. This may support the view that the antineoplastic effect of NSAIDs may also be due to a mechanism other than COX-2 inhibition. In breast cancer, large cohort studies reported a 40 to 50% reduced risk of developing cancer, a smaller size of the primary tumor, and a reduction in the number of involved axillary lymph nodes. Similar findings have been reported in the esophagus and stomach, but not in gastric cardia adenocarcinoma. The recent development of selective COX-2 inhibitors resulted in better clinical tolerance than that associated with NSAIDs in general, with the absence of gastrointestinal side effects known to occur after the inhibition of COX-1. Encouraging results have been obtained with these new agents in familial adenomatous polyposis, colon, breast, and prostate cancer."

However, the effects are limited to ER-positive breast cancer. Therefore, new agents with improved toxicity profiles that reduce the risk in ER-negative breast cancers are urgently needed. The aim of this prospective, short-term, prevention study was to evaluate the effect of dasatinib, an inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase Src, on biomarkers in normal (but increased risk) breast tissue and serum of women at high risk for a second, contralateral primary breast cancer. Women with a history of unilateral stage I, II, or III ER-negative breast cancer, having no active disease, and who completed all adjuvant therapies were eligible. Patients underwent baseline fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of the contralateral breast and serum collection for biomarker analysis and were randomized to receive either no treatment (control) or dasatinib at 40 or 80 mg/day for three months. After three months, serum collection and breast FNA were repeated. Planned biomarker analysis consisted of changes in cytology and Ki-67 on breast FNA, and changes in serum levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), IGF-binding protein 1, and IGF-binding protein 3. The primary objective was to evaluate changes in Ki-67 and secondary objective included changes in cytology in breast tissue and IGF-related serum biomarkers. Toxicity was also evaluated. Twenty-three patients started their assigned treatments. Compliance during the study was high, with 86.9% (20/23) of patients completing their assigned doses. Dasatinib was well tolerated and no drug-related grade 3 and 4 adverse events were observed. Since only one patient met the adequacy criteria for the paired FNA sample, we could not evaluate Ki-67 level or cytological changes. No significant change in serum biomarkers was observed among the three groups. Dasatinib was well tolerated but did not induce any significant changes in serum biomarkers. The study could not fulfill its primary objective due to an inadequate number of paired FNA samples. Further, larger studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of Src inhibitors in breast cancer prevention."
Prevention and management of colorectal cancer in women.,"Rao, Goodin","Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11486985/,"Colorectal cancer is the third most common non-skin cancer in women, after breast and lung cancers.

Articles published from January 1990 through February 2001 identified through a MEDLINE search using the term colorectal cancer and the additional terms screening, prevention, and treatment. Additional references were identified from the bibliographies of the retrieved articles. Colorectal cancer is the third most common non-skin cancer in women, after breast and lung cancers. Many women underestimate their risk of colorectal cancer, which may lead them to underuse screening measures that have been proven to reduce disease morbidity and mortality. For average-risk women and men > or = 50 years of age, pharmacists should recommend regular screening for early detection and prevention of colorectal cancer. In its earliest, most curable stages, colorectal cancer is often asymptomatic. However, patients who report signs and symptoms, such as blood in the stool, abdominal pain, changes in bowel habits, unexplained weight loss, or iron deficiency anemia, should be referred for medical evaluation. The use of chemopreventive agents for colorectal cancer, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, hormone replacement therapy, and dietary calcium, holds significant promise, but further studies are needed before these agents can be recommended for cancer prevention in the general population. Surgical resection is the primary treatment modality for colorectal cancer, and adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended in patients with stage III disease and some high-risk patients with stage II disease. Pharmacists should be aware that women are more susceptible to dose-related toxicity effects of fluorouracil and leucovorin combination chemotherapy, the first-line regimen for adjuvant chemotherapy. Although often perceived as a disease that primarily affects men, colorectal cancer is an equally important health concern for women. By providing education and counseling, pharmacists can help raise women's awareness of this disease and encourage them to take steps to significantly reduce their risk."

The development of these markers requires three phases of study.,"Current chemoprevention trial designs based on epidemiological risk assessment and occurrence of cancer as an endpoint are inefficient and expensive. Novel biomarkers are needed to facilitate the development of chemopreventive interventions. The following four categories of biomarkers may be useful in prevention trials: histologic and morphometric markers; phenotypic markers of dysregulated proliferation, differentiation, and cell loss; specific oncogenes and growth regulators which are qualitatively or quantitatively altered in breast cancers; and markers of genetic and epigenetic instability. Some of these markers will be generally useful regardless of the chemopreventive approach used, whereas others may be uniquely useful in trials of specific chemopreventive agents [e.g., upregulation of progesterone receptor (PR) expression in response to tamoxifen]. The development of these markers requires three phases of study: ""Phase I"": assessing the prevalence of the putative marker in malignant and premalignant tissue from individuals who have developed breast cancer; ""Phase II"": assessing in vivo modulation of the biomarker by the proposed chemopreventive agent; and ""Phase III"": applying the proposed biomarker in larger-scale trials of chemopreventive agent in high-risk populations, either before or after the development of a primary breast malignancy. The use of these biomarkers may also allow identification of novel targets for chemoprevention."

The most common is the hereditary breast and ovarian syndrome caused by deleterious mutations of the BRCA1 or BRCa2 tumor-suppressor genes.,"Breast cancer is a genetic disease. The cancer phenotype is defined by a complex interplay between oncogenes, tumor-suppressor genes and epigenetic factors. Only 5-10% of all breast cancers can be attributed to one of several breast cancer familial syndromes, the most common of which is the hereditary breast and ovarian syndrome caused by deleterious mutations of the BRCA1 or BRCA2 tumor-suppressor genes. The functions of the BRCA proteins are not fully understood, although it is clear that they play a role in the control of transcription, regulation of the cell cycle and management of DNA damage. The inheritance of a deleterious BRCA mutation is accompanied by a 50-80% risk of developing breast cancer, 60% risk of developing a contralateral breast cancer and 15-25% risk of developing ovarian cancer. The clinical management of BRCA heterozygotes involves several strategies of primary, secondary and tertiary prevention. These include risk-reducing surgery, chemoprevention, lifestyle changes and increased surveillance. As we move beyond the 10-year anniversary of the discovery of the BRCA genes, we are inevitably led to thoughtful reflection on the impact of these genes in regards to the greater problem of sporadic breast cancer."

Tamoxifen may reduce the risk of primary breast cancer in women at increased risk. The benefit of tamoxifen in women who are not at risk is uncertain. The risks of developing thromboembolic disorders or endometrial cancer must be considered before tamoxifen is prescribed. Women should be given all of the information about the benefits and risks of tamoxifen use so that they can make an informed decision based on the best data available."

"Cigarette smoking, obesity, physical activity, and alcohol use as predictors of chemoprevention adherence in the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project P-1 Breast Cancer Prevention Trial.","Land, Cronin, Wickerham, Costantino, Christian, Klein, Ganz","Journal Article, Randomized Controlled Trial, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21862698/,The National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) Breast Cancer Prevention Trial (BCPT) showed a 50% reduction in the risk of breast cancer for tamoxifen.

This first report of the rich BCPT drug adherence data examines predictors of adherence.,"The double-blind, prospective, National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) Breast Cancer Prevention Trial (BCPT) showed a 50% reduction in the risk of breast cancer for tamoxifen versus placebo, yet many women at risk of breast cancer do not adhere to the 5-year course. This first report of the rich BCPT drug adherence data examines predictors of adherence. Between June, 1992 and September, 1997 13,338 women at high risk of breast cancer were randomly assigned to 20 mg/d tamoxifen versus placebo; we analyzed the 11,064 enrolled more than 3 years before trial unblinding. Primary endpoint was full drug adherence (100% of assigned pills per staff report, excluding protocol-required discontinuation) at 1 and 36 months; secondary was adequate adherence (76%-100%). Protocol-specified multivariable logistic regression tested lifestyle factors, controlling for demographic and medical predictors. About 13% were current smokers; 60% were overweight/obese; 46% had moderate/heavy physical activity; 21%, 66%, 13% drank 0, 0-1, 1+ drinks per day, respectively; 91% were adequately adherent at 1 month; and 79% were at 3 years. Alcohol use was associated with reduced full adherence at 1 month (P = 0.016; OR = 0.79 1+ vs. 0), as was college education (P <0.001; OR = 0.78 vs. high school); age (P < 0.001; OR = 1.4 age 60+) and per capita household annual income (P < 0.001; OR = 1.2 per $30,000) with increased adherence. Current smoking (P = 0.003; OR = 0.75), age (P = 0.024, OR = 1.1), college education (P = 0.037; OR = 1.4), tamoxifen assignment (P = 0.031; OR = 0.84), and breast cancer risk (P <.001; OR = 1.5 high vs. low) predicted adequate adherence at 36 months. There were no significant associations with obesity or physical activity. Alcohol use and smoking might indicate a need for greater adherence support."
Breast cancer risk assessment and risk reduction.,"Newman, Vogel","Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17498528/,"Currently, tamoxifen is approved for chemoprevention of breast cancer in high-risk women. Studies are underway evaluating other medications that may decrease breast cancer risk. Any prevention method, however, will have associated risk of complications or adverse effects.","Until recently, the primary message of breast health awareness programs was that early detection is a woman's best protection against breast cancer, because there was no way to prevent it. Currently, however, tamoxifen is approved for chemoprevention of breast cancer in high-risk women, and studies are underway evaluating other medications that may decrease breast cancer risk. Data have also become available regarding the efficacy of surgical strategies to reduce breast cancer risk. Any prevention method, however, will have associated risk of complications or adverse effects, and determining the net risk/benefit ratio depends on the ability to accurately quantify a woman's baseline likelihood of developing breast cancer. This article reviews available methods for assessing and reducing breast cancer risk."
Chemoprevention in postmenopausal women.,Rastogi,"Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18596603/,Tamoxifen at 20 mg/d reduced the incidence of breast cancer by 38%. The risk of developing breast cancer is the primary determinant of net benefit. Raloxifene has also been shown to reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer in women with osteoporosis.,"Several large, prospective trials have evaluated tamoxifen compared with placebo for breast cancer risk reduction in women at increased risk of breast cancer. Combined results from these trials demonstrate that tamoxifen at 20 mg/d reduced the incidence of breast cancer by 38%. The risk of developing breast cancer is the primary determinant of net benefit, with greater benefits accrued to women with the highest risk of breast cancer. Age and the presence of risk factors for increased toxicity also have an effect on the net benefit associated with tamoxifen. The greatest clinical benefit from tamoxifen is evident for younger women who are at lower risk of thromboembolic complications and uterine cancer, women without a uterus, and women with breast biopsy results indicative of atypical hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ. Raloxifene has also been shown to reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer in women with osteoporosis and is as effective as tamoxifen for reducing the risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women at increased risk of breast cancer. In high-risk younger, postmenopausal women, raloxifene seems to offer a net benefit when comparing the reduction of risk of breast cancer and prevention of fractures with the risk of stroke, venous thromboembolic events, uterine events, and symptomatic side effects. Raloxifene offers an acceptable option for breast cancer risk reduction in postmenopausal women."
Delineating the role of osteoprotegerin as a marker of breast cancer risk among women with a BRCA1 mutation.,"Park, Uzelac, Kotsopoulos","Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35418083/,Women with a pathogenic germline mutation in the BRCA1 gene face a very high lifetime risk of developing breast cancer. Prophylactic bilateral mastectomy is the only effective way to lower their risk. Most women with a mutation opt for intensive screening with annual MRI and mammography.,"Women with a pathogenic germline mutation in the BRCA1 gene face a very high lifetime risk of developing breast cancer, estimated at 72% by age 80. Prophylactic bilateral mastectomy is the only effective way to lower their risk; however, most women with a mutation opt for intensive screening with annual MRI and mammography. Given that the BRCA1 gene was identified over 20 years ago, there is a need to identify a novel non-surgical approach to hereditary breast cancer prevention. Here, we provide a review of the emerging preclinical and epidemiologic evidence implicating the dysregulation of progesterone-mediated receptor activator of nuclear factor κB (RANK) signaling in the pathogenesis of BRCA1-associated breast cancer. Experimental studies have demonstrated that RANK inhibition suppresses Brca1-mammary tumorigenesis, suggesting a potential target for prevention. Data from studies conducted among women with a BRCA1 mutation further support this pathway in BRCA1-associated breast cancer development. Progesterone-containing (but not estrogen-alone) hormone replacement therapy is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in women with a BRCA1 mutation. Furthermore, BRCA1 mutation carriers have significantly lower levels of circulating osteoprotegerin (OPG), the decoy receptor for RANK-ligand (RANKL) and thus endogenous inhibitor of RANK signaling. OPG levels may be associated with the risk of disease, suggesting a role of this protein as a potential biomarker of breast cancer risk. This may improve upon current risk prediction models, stratifying women at the highest risk of developing the disease, and further identify those who may be targets for anti-RANKL chemoprevention. Collectively, the evidence supports therapeutic inhibition of the RANK pathway for the primary prevention of BRCA1-associated breast cancer, which may generate unique prevention strategies (without prophylactic surgery) and enhance quality of life."
Non-aspirin non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for the primary chemoprevention of non-gastrointestinal cancer: summary of evidence.,"Silva, Galvao, Zimmerman, Pereira, Lopes","Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22632754/,"There is evidence that aspirin is effective for the chemoprevention of colorectal cancer.

Due to their similar pharmacodynamics, the use of other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been suggested for other cancer sites. Although this possibility has been discussed in the literature, uncertainty remains about the actual effects of NSAIDs other than aspirin in nongastrointestinal cancer. To summarize the best available evidence of the primary chemopreventive effects of non-aspirin NSAIDs for nongastrointestinal cancer. Our inclusion criteria were narrative or systematic reviews, clinical guidelines and, if they had not been previously included, primary controlled studies that evaluated the effectiveness of non-aspirin NSAIDs in preventing non-gastrointestinal cancer in healthy individuals. Studies were retrieved from the following databases: Guidelines.gov, BMJ Clinical Evidence, TRIP database, UpToDate, MEDLINE, CANCERLIT, Embase, CINAHL, ISI Web of Science and Scopus. Two independent reviewers selected eligible studies. Data were extracted by one reviewer and crosschecked by two others. We found 9,984 non-duplicated articles and included 56 eligible studies. Most of these studies were observational. The studies reported conflicting results or no statistically significant associations between the use of non-aspirin NSAIDs and risk of lung, ovary, bladder, prostate, skin, and head and neck cancers. In contrast, an increased risk of renal cell carcinoma and a reduced risk of breast cancer were found to be statistically significant. The included studies had methodological limitations, which reduces our confidence in their results. We did not find sufficient evidence to support the use of the non-aspirin NSAIDs for the primary chemoprevention of a wide variety of non-gastrointestinal cancers. This scenario suggests caution when considering the routine use of non-aspirin NSAIDs. Additional well-conducted controlled studies may provide more conclusive evidence on this issue, but there are concerns about the risks of such exposure."

The efficacy of tamoxifen as a chemopreventive agent has been studied to date in three randomized, controlled trials, with varying results. Investigators with the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) Breast Cancer Prevention Trial found that tamoxifen reduced the incidence of breast cancer by almost half, whereas British and Italian researchers found no significant benefit. This disparity is due, in part, to differences in the baseline breast cancer risk characteristics among the study populations, differing cohort sizes, variable use of hormone replacement therapy, and other factors. In this article, we review the eligibility criteria, treatment plans, and results from the three published randomized trials of tamoxifen versus placebo. We also review the data on raloxifene and breast cancer incidence. Chemoprevention with tamoxifen, in a non-study setting, is one option for women at increased risk for breast cancer. The ongoing Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene (STAR) is a randomized, double-blinded trial comparing the effectiveness of raloxifene with that of tamoxifen in postmenopausal women at increased risk for developing breast cancer. Until the results of this trial are available, it is premature to use raloxifene for primary breast cancer prevention."

We identified all women recorded with a first primary breast cancer in the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group Database between 1996 and 2012. Information on drug use, tumor and patient characteristics, treatment, and CBC was obtained from nationwide registries. In the main analysis, we defined time-varying post-diagnosis low-dose aspirin use as two or more prescriptions filled during follow-up and applied a one-year exposure lag. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between post-diagnosis low-dose aspirin use and CBC risk.

The increasing prevalence of bacterial resistance to antibiotics calls for a reduction in unnecessary antibiotic use. The aim of this review was to create an updated summary of the available data on the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis in reducing the postoperative infection in clean and clean-contaminated plastic surgery. A systematic literature search was performed on the databases Medline, Web of Science, and Scopus, limited to articles published January 2000 onward. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the primary review, whereas older RCTs and other studies were sought if 2 or fewer relevant RCTs were identified. Overall, 28 relevant RCTs, 2 nonrandomized trials, and 15 cohort studies were identified. Although the number of studies for each type of surgery is limited, the data suggest that prophylactic systemic antibiotic may be unnecessary in noncontaminated facial plastic surgery, reduction mammaplasty, and breast augmentation. In addition, no benefit is apparent from extending the antibiotic prophylaxis over 24 h in rhinoplasty, aerodigestive tract reconstruction, and breast reconstruction. No studies assessing the necessity of antibiotic prophylaxis in abdominoplasty, lipotransfer, soft tissue tumor surgery, or gender affirmation surgery were identified. In conclusion, limited data are available on the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis in clean and clean-contaminated plastic surgery. More studies on this topic are needed before strong recommendations can be made on the use of antibiotics in this setting."

Both primary and sensitivity analyses were conducted using different classifications of low, medium and high worry. 39.5% of respondents reported medium breast cancer worry at baseline and 21.2% reported high worry. Ethnic minority women were more likely to report high worry than white women (OR = 3.02, 95%CI 1.02, 8.91, p = 0.046). Women educated below degree level were more likely to report high worry than those with higher education (OR = 2.29, 95%CI 1.28, 4.09, p = 0.005). No statistically significant association was observed between worry and uptake. In the primary analysis, fewer respondents with medium worry at baseline initiated tamoxifen (low worry = 15.5%, medium = 13.5%, high = 15.7%). In the sensitivity analysis, participants with medium worry reported the highest uptake of tamoxifen (19.7%). No association was observed between worry and uptake, although the relationship was affected by the categorisation of worry.

Our group has made a particular effort with regard to this molecule in clinical studies aimed at evaluating its pharmacology, toxicity, and efficacy in breast cancer prevention. We have demonstrated that 4-HPR blood levels remain constant during administration for as long as 5 years, that the drug accumulates in the human breast, and that it induces a significant decline of plasma insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels. To date, 2,972 Stage I breast cancer patients have been randomized to evaluate the efficacy of a 5-year administration of 4-HPR to prevent new contralateral primary breast cancers. Compliance to protocol and treatment is high and tolerability of the drug is good; only 51 women out of 1,397 (3.6%) had to interrupt drug intake due to toxicity. The only potential limitation to the extensive use of 4-HPR is diminished dark adaptation, which occurs in about one-fourth of the patients and is dependent on the decline of plasma retinol below the threshold level of 100 ng/ml. Plasma levels of (4-methoxyphenyl)retinamide (4-MPR), the principal metabolite of 4-HPR, which are higher in elderly women with a high percentage of adipose tissue, are the major determinants of the retinol decrease. However, about 50% of the patients with altered dark-adaptometry are asymptomatic and the alterations are promptly reversible upon drug discontinuation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Understanding effect modifiers is important given that any use of aspirin for ovarian cancer chemoprevention will likely need to focus on specific higher-risk subgroups. To evaluate whether the association between frequent aspirin use and ovarian cancer is modified by a polygenic score (PGS) for nonmucinous ovarian cancer. We pooled individual-level data from 8 population-based case-control studies from the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium conducted in the US, UK, and Australia between 1995 and 2009. We included case patients and control participants with both genetic data and data on frequent aspirin use. Case patients with mucinous ovarian cancer were excluded. Data were analyzed between November 1, 2021, and July 31, 2022. Frequent aspirin use, defined as daily or almost daily use for 6 months or longer. The main outcome was nonmucinous epithelial ovarian cancer. We used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs and likelihood ratio tests to investigate effect modification by the PGS. There were 4476 case patients with nonmucinous ovarian cancer and 6659 control participants included in this analysis. At study enrollment, the median (IQR) age was 58 (50-66) years for case patients and 57 (49-65) years for control participants. Case patients and control participants self-reported that they were Black (122 [3%] vs 218 [3%]), White (3995 [89%] vs 5851 [88%]), or of other race and ethnicity (348 [8%] vs 580 [9%]; race and ethnicity were unknown for 11 [0%] vs 10 [0%]). There were 575 case patients (13%) and 1030 control participants (15%) who reported frequent aspirin use. The 13% reduction in ovarian cancer risk associated with frequent aspirin use (OR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.76-0.99]) was not modified by the PGS. Consistent ORs were observed among individuals with a PGS less than (0.85 [0.70-1.02]) and greater than (0.86 [0.74-1.01]) the median. Results were similar by histotype. The findings of this study suggest that genetic susceptibility to ovarian cancer based on currently identified common genetic variants does not appear to modify the protective association between frequent aspirin use and ovarian cancer risk. Future work should continue to explore the role of aspirin use for ovarian cancer prevention among individuals who are at higher risk for ovarian cancer."

Report details the preventive strategies aimed at reducing the incidence and mortality of large bowel cancer by nutritional manipulation and chemopreventive agents.,"Large bowel cancer is one of the most common human malignancies in Western countries including North America. This report details the preventive strategies aimed at reducing the incidence and mortality of large bowel cancer by nutritional manipulation and chemopreventive agents. During recent decades, multidisciplinary research in epidemiology and laboratory animal model studies have contributed much to our understanding of the etiology of this cancer; more importantly, it has enabled us to approach cancer prevention. An impressive body of data thus far accumulated has provided important concepts about dietary factors such as fat and fiber as key modulators of large bowel cancer. Compelling experimental evidence indicates that certain dietary lipids and fibers influence tumorigenesis in the colon. Data obtained in metabolic epidemiological and laboratory animal model studies are sufficiently convincing in showing the enhancement of colon cancer by certain types of fat and protection against it by certain dietary fibers. Our approach to the primary prevention of large bowel cancer is to translate the findings from clinical epidemiological and laboratory studies into sound advice for patients and for the public at large to reduce fat intake and increase fiber intake, specifically cereals and grains. Preclinical efficacy studies have provided scientifically sound evidence as to how several phytochemicals and their synthetic analogues act to retard, block, or reverse carcinogenesis. Equally exciting are opportunities for effective chemoprevention with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, both synthetic and naturally occurring, or selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors. Our exploration of the multistep process of carcinogenesis has provided substantial insights into the mechanisms by which chemopreventive agents modulate these events. Growing knowledge in this area has brought about an innovative combination of agents with different modes of action as a means of increasing efficacy and minimizing toxicity. There is growing optimism for the view that realization of preventive concepts in large bowel cancer will also serve as a model for preventing malignancies such as cancer of the prostate and breast."

There is therefore an urgent need for alternative and non-surgical risk reduction options. Tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors have both been evaluated in secondary prevention, but their benefit in primary prevention is currently unknown in BRCA mutation carriers. In addition, their use is compromised by their side effect profile which makes them less appealing for a use in chemoprevention.

The prospectively randomized double-blind BRCA-P trial is currently investigating the preventative effect of denosumab in healthy <i>BRCA1</i> germ line mutation carriers."
Chemoprevention in head and neck cancer.,"Heyne, Lippman, Hong","Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1890067/," chemoprevention is being applied to asymptomatic populations at higher risk for lung, colon, breast, and other neoplasias. Biomarkers may be instrumental in rapid development of these new clinical applications, but much is still to be done.","It is not a coincidence that the aerodigestive tract has proven such a fertile ground for the evaluation of chemoprevention. The incidence of second primaries and the concept of field cancerization made the need for prevention acute and showed the limitations of even the most curative of treatments. New and presumably less toxic agents are being evaluated; chemoprevention is being applied to asymptomatic populations at higher risk for lung, colon, breast, and other neoplasias. Biomarkers may be instrumental in rapid development of these new clinical applications, but much is still to be done. Yet unanswered is whether suppression of premalignant lesions will ultimately decrease cancer incidence. Survival in the second primary prevention trial has not thus far shown a significant improvement and toxicities were significant. Many questions remain in the study of chemoprevention; head and neck cancer provides a conducive model in which these answers might be found."
Chemoprevention of breast cancer: a summary of the evidence for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.,"Kinsinger, Harris, Woolf, Sox, Lohr","Journal Article, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S., Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12093250/,Tamoxifen and raloxifene reduce the incidence of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer in women. The relative risk reduction seems similar across all breast cancer risk groups. Both drugs increased risk for venous thromboembolic disease and hot flashes.,"Chemoprevention offers promise as a strategy for reducing morbidity and mortality from breast cancer in women. This review examined the evidence for the effectiveness of chemoprevention in women without a history of breast cancer. MEDLINE (1966 to December 2001). English-language, randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) of chemoprevention of breast cancer in women without a previous diagnosis of breast cancer were examined, and 4 relevant trials, 3 involving tamoxifen and 1 involving raloxifene, were selected. Trials that provided data on the harms of tamoxifen or raloxifene, studies of the costs of chemoprevention, and studies of risk assessment were also reviewed. Four reviewers independently abstracted data on key variables, including study population, sample size, randomization, treatment, and outcomes. The largest of the RCTs of tamoxifen reported a 49% reduction in relative risk (0.51 [95% CI, 0.39 to 0.66]) for invasive cancer among women with an estimated 5-year breast cancer risk of at least 1.66%. The other tamoxifen trials did not observe a statistically significant benefit, but only a few women in each trial took tamoxifen during the entire study period. The raloxifene study of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis found a 76% reduction in relative risk (0.24 [CI, 0.13 to 0.44]) for invasive breast cancer. Tamoxifen and raloxifene were effective only against estrogen receptor-positive tumors. Both drugs increased risk for venous thromboembolic disease and hot flashes; tamoxifen increased risk for endometrial cancer and stroke. Tamoxifen and raloxifene reduce the incidence of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer in women. The relative risk reduction seems similar across all breast cancer risk groups. The absolute risk reduction varies by risk factors for breast cancer, however, and must be balanced against the potential harms to judge the appropriateness of treatment for individual women."
Prophylactic antibiotics to prevent surgical site infection after breast cancer surgery.,"Jones, Bunn, Bell-Syer","Journal Article, Meta-Analysis, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Review, Systematic Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24609957/,Pre- and perioperative antibiotics have been found to be useful in lowering infection rates in other surgical groups. There is no consensus on the use of prophylactic antibiotics for breast cancer surgery. A total of eleven studies (2867 participants) were included in the review.,"Surgery has been used as part of breast cancer treatment for centuries; however any surgical procedure has the potential risk of infection. Infection rates for surgical treatment of breast cancer are documented at between 3% and 15%, higher than average for a clean surgical procedure. Pre- and perioperative antibiotics have been found to be useful in lowering infection rates in other surgical groups, yet there is no consensus on the use of prophylactic antibiotics for breast cancer surgery. To determine the effects of prophylactic (pre- or perioperative) antibiotics on the incidence of surgical site infection (SSI) after breast cancer surgery. For this third update we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (5 December 2013); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library); the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (The Cochrane Library); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE; and EBSCO CINAHL. We applied no language or date restrictions. Randomised controlled trials of pre- and perioperative antibiotics for patients undergoing surgery for breast cancer were included. Primary outcomes were rates of surgical site infection (SSI) and adverse reactions. Two review authors independently examined the title and abstracts of all studies identified by the search strategy, then assessed study quality and extracted data from those that met the inclusion criteria. A total of eleven studies (2867 participants) were included in the review. Ten studies evaluated preoperative antibiotic compared with no antibiotic or placebo. One study evaluated perioperative antibiotic compared with no antibiotic. Pooling of the results demonstrated that prophylactic antibiotics administered preoperatively significantly reduce the incidence of SSI for patients undergoing breast cancer surgery without reconstruction (pooled risk ratio (RR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 0.85). Analysis of the single study comparing perioperative antibiotic with no antibiotic found no statistically significant effect of antibiotics on the incidence of SSI (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.95). No studies presented separate data for patients who underwent reconstructive surgery at the time of removal of the breast tumour. Prophylactic antibiotics administered preoperatively reduce the risk of SSI in patients undergoing surgery for breast cancer. Further studies involving patients undergoing immediate breast reconstruction are needed as studies have identified this group as being at higher risk of infection than those who do not undergo immediate breast reconstruction."
Short-term biomarker modulation prevention study of anastrozole in women at increased risk for second primary breast cancer.,"Arun, Valero, Liu, Brewster, Green, Gutierrez-Barrera, Akar, Rivera, Esteva, Buzdar, Hortobagyi, Sneige","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22102688/,The mechanism by which AIs reduce breast risk is not known.

Patient acceptance of SERMs for breast cancer prevention is low due to toxicities. New agents with a better toxicity profile are needed. Aromatase inhibitors (AI) reduce the risk of contralateral breast cancer and risk of new breast cancer in high risk women. However, the mechanism by which AIs reduce breast risk is not known. Surrogate biomarkers are needed to evaluate the effect of preventive agents. The objective of this prospective short-term prevention study was to evaluate the effect of anastrozole on biomarkers in breast tissue and serum of women at increased risk for developing a contralateral breast cancer. Women with a history of stage I, II breast cancer who started anastrozole for standard adjuvant treatment were eligible. Patients underwent baseline fine needle aspiration of the unaffected breast and serum collection for biomarker analysis before starting anastrozole at 1 mg per oral/day and again at 6 months. Biomarkers included changes in cytology, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), IGF-binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1), and IGFBP-3. Thirty-seven patients were enrolled. There was a significant modulation in serum IGFBP-1 levels between pre- and postsamples (P = 0.02). No change was observed in IGF-1, IGFBP-3, and breast cytology.We showed a significant modulation of IGFBP-1 levels with six months anastrozole. Anastrozole is currently being studied as a prevention agent in a large phase III trial and our results provide support for continued evaluation of IGFBP-1 as a surrogate endpoint biomarker in prospective breast chemoprevention studies."
"Zingiberene exerts chemopreventive activity against 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene-induced breast cancer in Sprague-Dawley rats.","Seshadri, Oyouni, Bawazir, Alsagaby, Alsharif, Albrakati, Al-Amer",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35698847/,"Zingiberene is a monocyclic sesquiterpene from the ginger plant and has many pharmacological benefits.

Zingiberene is a monocyclic sesquiterpene from the ginger plant and has many pharmacological benefits. In this exploration, we assessed the anticancer actions of Zingiberene against the 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)-stimulated mammary carcinogenesis in rats and MDA-MB-231 cells. Breast cancer was induced in the Female Sprague-Dawley rats through the 25 mg/kg of DMBA in 0.5 ml of corn oil and then treated with 20 and 40 mg/kg of Zingiberene, respectively. The body weight of animals and tumor volume was measured. Hematological parameters, transaminases, lipid profile, lipid peroxidation, and antioxidants status were scrutinized using standard techniques. The estrogen receptor-α and inflammatory markers were inspected by using respective assay kits. Histological damage scores were determined. In vitro experiments were conducted to scrutinize Zingiberene's effect on cell viability and apoptotic cell death in MDA-MB-231 cells. Zingiberene substantially modulated the DMBA-stimulated physiological and hematological changes and decreased the transaminases, and lipid peroxidation in the DMBA-stimulated animals. Zingiberene also elevated the antioxidant level and suppressed the inflammatory markers. Histological study revealed the protective effects of Zingiberene. The viability of MDA-MB-231 cells was noticeably diminished by the Zingiberene, thus inducing apoptotic cell death. Overall, our findings reliably proved the anticancer potential of Zingiberene against the DMBA-stimulated mammary tumorigenesis, and it could be a promising chemotherapeutic agent."

Here, we estimate the numbers of women in a population eligible for this service and the proportion of breast cancers detected in this group compared with the whole population. Women <50 attending for mammographic screening in the National Health Service Breast Screening Programme (NHSBSP) completed a risk questionnaire. The proportion at moderate and high risk according to National Institute of Health Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines was estimated. An estimate was also made using a different model of risk estimation (Tyrer-Cuzick). The numbers of cancers detected in the moderate/high risk groups were compared with numbers detected in the whole population. Completed questionnaires were available for 4,360 women between ages 46 and 49 years. Thirty women [0.7%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.5-1.0%] were at high risk and 130 (3.0%, 2.5-3.5%) were at moderate risk according to NICE guidelines. Thirty-seven cancers were detected by mammography in the whole group. Five of these were found in the moderate-/high-risk group giving a 3.2-fold increase in detection compared with the standard risk group. More women were assigned to the moderate- or high-risk group using the Tyrer-Cuzick model (N = 384), but the numbers of cancers in this group were not appreciably increased (N = 8). Systematic assessment of family history in primary care or through population-based screening will identify appreciable numbers of women in their forties, eligible for additional surveillance and chemoprevention."
Tamoxifen's role in chemoprevention of breast cancer: an update.,Nayfield,"Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8538209/,Tamoxifen is an oral antiestrogen first used in metastatic breast cancer in the early 1970s.

Large clinical trials were initiated in the late 1970s and early 1980s to test the drug's role as adjuvant therapy in early stage breast cancer. Observations of marked decreases in the development of contralateral breast cancer among tamoxifen recipients suggested potential for the drug in chemoprevention of breast cancer, and a large clinical trial to test the efficacy of tamoxifen in prevention of invasive breast cancer among women at increased risk was implemented in the United States in 1992. This paper reviews the rational for the clinical studies of tamoxifen as a chemopreventive agent for breast cancer and summarizes new information that has contributed to our understanding of tamoxifen's actions at the molecular and clinical levels. Current knowledge about the drug's mechanism of estrogenic and antiestrogenic action and its beneficial effects on blood lipids and bone metabolism will be presented. Recent research findings about DNA adduct formation and hepatic lesions, tamoxifen-associated gynecologic conditions, and the occurrence of second primary cancers in other organ systems will also be discussed."

The aim of this study is to identify provider-related barriers to shared decision-making (SDM) for chemoprevention in the primary care setting. Primary care providers (PCPs) and high-risk women eligible for chemoprevention were enrolled in a pilot study and a randomized clinical trial of web-based decision support tools to increase chemoprevention uptake. PCPs included internists, family practitioners, and gynecologists, whereas patients were high-risk women, age 35-75 years, who had a 5-year invasive breast cancer risk ≥ 1.67%, according to the Gail model. Seven clinical encounters of high-risk women and their PCPs who were given access to these decision support tools were included in this study. Audio-recordings of the clinical encounters were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using grounded theory methodology. Six primary care providers, of which four were males (mean age 36 [SD 6.5]) and two were females (mean age 39, [SD 11.5]) and seven racially/ethnically diverse high-risk female patients participated in this study. Qualitative analysis revealed three themes: (1) Competing demands during clinical encounters; (2) lack of knowledge among providers about chemoprevention; and (3) limited risk communication during clinical encounters. Critical barriers to SDM about chemoprevention were identified among PCPs. Providers need education and resources through decision support tools to engage in risk communication and SDM with their high-risk patients, and to gain confidence in prescribing chemoprevention in the primary care setting."

Although these mutations are uncommon, public interest in testing for them is growing. To determine benefits and harms of screening for inherited breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility in the general population of women without cancer presenting for primary health care in the United States. MEDLINE (1966 to 1 October 2004), Cochrane Library databases, reference lists, reviews, Web sites, and experts. Eligibility was determined by inclusion criteria specific to key questions about risk assessment, genetic counseling, mutation testing, prevention interventions, and potential adverse effects. After review of studies, data were extracted, entered into evidence tables, and summarized by using descriptive or statistical methods. Study quality was rated by using predefined criteria. Tools assessing risks for mutations and referral guidelines have been developed; their accuracy, effectiveness, and adverse effects in primary care settings are unknown. Risk assessment, genetic counseling, and mutation testing did not cause adverse psychological outcomes, and counseling improved distress and risk perception in the highly selected populations studied. Intensive cancer screening studies are inconclusive. Chemoprevention trials indicate risk reduction for breast cancer in women with varying levels of risk, as well as increased adverse effects. Observational studies of prophylactic surgeries report reduced risks for breast and ovarian cancer in mutation carriers. No data describe the range of risk associated with BRCA mutations, genetic heterogeneity, and moderating factors; studies conducted in highly selected populations contain biases; and information on adverse effects is incomplete. A primary care approach to screening for inherited breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility has not been evaluated, and evidence is lacking to determine benefits and harms for the general population."
Chemoprevention Agents to Reduce Mammographic Breast Density in Premenopausal Women: A Systematic Review of Clinical Trials.,"Salazar, Rakhmankulova, Simon, Toriola","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Systematic Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33554041/,High mammographic breast density (MBD) is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.

Findings from this review should provide insight on how to target MBD in breast cancer prevention in premenopausal women with dense breasts.,"Higher mammographic breast density (MBD) is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer when compared with lower MBD, especially in premenopausal women. However, little is known about the effectiveness of chemoprevention agents in reducing MBD in premenopausal women without a history of breast cancer. Findings from this review should provide insight on how to target MBD in breast cancer prevention in premenopausal women with dense breasts. We searched 9 electronic databases for clinical trials in English, Spanish, French, or German published until January 2020. Articles evaluating the association of pharmacological agents and MBD were included. Data were extracted on methods, type and dose of intervention, outcomes, side effects, and follow up. Quality of the studies was assessed using the US Preventive Services Task Force criteria. We identified 7 clinical trials evaluating the associations of 6 chemoprevention agents with changes in MBD in premenopausal women without history of breast cancer. The studies evaluated selective estrogen-receptor modulators (n = 1); gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (n = 2); isoflavones (n = 1); vitamin D (n = 1); and Boswellia, betaine, and mayo-inositol compound (n = 1). Hormonal interventions were associated with net reductions in percent density (tamoxifen [13.4%], leuprolide acetate [8.9%], and goserelin [2.7%]), whereas nonhormonal (vitamin D and isoflavone) interventions were not. However, MBD returned to preintervention baseline levels after cessation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists. A limited number of chemoprevention agents have been shown to reduce MBD in premenopausal women. Identification of new and well-tolerated chemoprevention agents targeting MBD and larger studies to confirm agents that have been studied in small trials are urgent priorities for primary breast cancer prevention in premenopausal women with dense breasts."

The aim of this study was to provide an updated comprehensive analysis of the literature to revisit the benefit of antibiotic prophylaxis. A total of 5 studies (3 observational and 2 RCTs) with 2383 patients were included in this study.,"The administration of antibiotic prophylaxis for implant-based breast augmentation (IBBA) is commonplace among many plastic surgeons. However, the current literature lacks evidence-based recommendations to support this practice. Although few studies have demonstrated a reduction in surgical site infection (SSI) and capsular contracture (CC) with antibiotics, these studies were underpowered and poorly designed. The aim of this study was to provide an updated comprehensive analysis of the literature to revisit the benefit of antibiotic prophylaxis. A comprehensive literature search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane was performed from January 1989 to January 2022. Observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving primary and secondary IBBA and use of antibiotic prophylaxis were included. Primary outcomes included SSI and CC. Study quality and risk of bias were evaluated using standardized tools. A meta-analysis was performed for eligible studies. Trial Sequential Analysis was used to assess the need for future RCTs. A total of 5 studies (3 observational and 2 RCTs) with 2383 patients were included in this study. Rates of SSI ranged from 0% to 2.3%, whereas CC ranged from 0% to 53%. Antibiotic prophylaxis showed no benefit for both SSI (odds ratio, 1.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.76-4.13) and CC (odds ratio, 0.46; 95% confidence interval, 0.00-45.72). Trial Sequential Analysis demonstrated that further high-quality RCTs are needed. Antibiotic prophylaxis for IBBA failed to demonstrate improvements in SSI and CC in this comprehensive review. Current evidence was shown to be of low quality because of heterogeneity and high risk for bias. Further high-quality multicentered RCTs are warranted to fully evaluate the role of antibiotic prophylaxis for IBBA."
Cyclooxygenase-2 as a target for anticancer drug development.,"Méric, Rottey, Olaussen, Soria, Khayat, Rixe, Spano","Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16531064/,Low COX-2 expression is observed in some cancers like prostate or breast cancer. This phenomenon is quite surprising and should influence on clinical trial designs. NSAIDs effects in cancer cells are mediated not only by COX enzymes but also by interactions with downstream effectors of COx-2.,"The two isoforms cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 catalyze the initial step in the formation of prostaglandins in a variety of pathophysiological processes. More recently their role in carcinogenesis has become more evident. They seem to influence apoptosis, angiogenesis, and invasion, and play a role in the production of carcinogens. Usually, a high level of COX-2 expression is found in cancer cells. However, low COX-2 expression is observed in some cancers like prostate or breast cancer. This phenomenon is quite surprising and should influence on clinical trial designs. Large epidemiological trials studying users and non-users of aspirin have shown that cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) could be of benefit against the development and growth of malignancies. Moreover, clinical trials in patients with familial adenomatosis polyposis syndrome have shown too the efficacy of non-selective COX inhibitors and recently also of selective COX-2 inhibitors in the reduction of the number and the size of colorectal polyps. However, a primary chemopreventive effect has not been demonstrated yet. NSAIDs are also supposed to have a preventive and growth inhibitory effect in extra-colonic epithelial malignancies. Several preclinical studies show promising results with combination treatments of either chemotherapy or radiotherapy with COX inhibitors. Preclinical studies with the simultaneous use of inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor and COX-2 inhibitors have shown also promising results. Encouraging results with the first clinical trials combining chemotherapy with COX-2 inhibitors in patients with cancer in the advanced and neoadjuvant setting have recently been reported. However, NSAIDs effects in cancer cells are mediated not only by COX enzymes but also by interactions with downstream effectors of COX-2. Hence, we can state that targeting the COX-2 pathway is a promising strategy in the prevention and treatment of solid tumors. Ongoing trials are expected to answer - at least partly - the remaining questions concerning COX-2 and cancer."

In addition, pharmacologic amounts of retinoids have been used with some success in the treatment of a few human tumors. The chemoprevention effect of retinoids is most likely exerted at the tumor-promotion phase of carcinogenesis. Retinoids block tumor promotion by inhibiting proliferation, inducing apoptosis, inducing differentiation, or a combination of these actions. Clinically, isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid) significantly decreases the incidence of second primary tumors in patients with head-and-neck cancer and reduces appearance of non-melanoma skin cancer in patients with xeroderma pigmentosum. Retinoic acid has proved to be an effective treatment for promyelocytic leukemia. However, retinoid resistance limits its use as a single agent. Clinical trials are in progress to determine the efficacy of retinoids in treating other types of cancer such as neuroblastoma and breast carcinoma.

Five articles were included in the qualitative and quantitative analysis.,"To determine the effectiveness and harm of using antibiotic prophylaxis versus placebo or no intervention in patients undergoing breast reduction surgery to prevent surgical site infection. A search strategy was conducted in the MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE, and LILACS databases. Searches were also conducted in other databases and unpublished literature. Clinical trials were included without language restrictions. The risk of bias was evaluated with the Cochrane Collaboration's tool. An analysis of fixed effects was conducted. The primary outcome was surgical site infection. The secondary outcomes were delayed wound healing and adverse effects. The measure of the effect was the risk difference (RD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The planned interventions were antibiotic prophylaxis versus placebo/no intervention. Five articles were included in the qualitative and quantitative analysis. A total of 584 patients were included from the five studies. A low risk of bias was shown for most of the study items. The overall RD for surgical site infection was -0.08 (95% CI -0.14--0.03), favoring antibiotic prophylaxis compared with placebo. Antibiotic prophylaxis lowers the incidence of surgical site infection in breast reduction surgery compared with placebo or no intervention."
Evaluation of CYP2D6 and efficacy of tamoxifen and raloxifene in women treated for breast cancer chemoprevention: results from the NSABP P1 and P2 clinical trials.,"Goetz, Schaid, Wickerham, Safgren, Mushiroda, Kubo, Batzler, Costantino, Vogel, Paik, Carlson, Flockhart, Wolmark, Nakamura, Weinshilboum, Ingle, Ames","Clinical Trial, Journal Article, Randomized Controlled Trial, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21880792/,"Controversy exists regarding the association between CYP2D6 enzyme activity and tamoxifen effectiveness in the adjuvant treatment of invasive breast cancer.

Information regarding the use of CYP2D6 inhibitors was recorded. A total of 591 cases were matched to 1,126 controls and DNA was genotyped in more than 97%. In patients treated with tamoxifen, there was no association of CYP2D6 genotype [OR (extensive/poor metabolizer): 0.90; 95% CI: 0.46-1.74, P = 0.74), use of a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor (OR 0.92; 95% CI: 0.575-1.486), or CYP2D6 metabolizer status (OR 1.03; 95% CI: 0.669-1.607) with breast cancer occurrence. Likewise, there was no association between any CYP2D6 metabolism parameter with breast cancer events in raloxifene-treated patients. In the NSABP P1 and P2 clinical trials, alterations in CYP2D6 metabolism are not associated with either tamoxifen or raloxifene efficacy."
Surrogate endpoints in chemoprevention of breast cancer: guidelines for evaluation of new biomarkers.,"Hilsenbeck, Clark","Journal Article, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S., Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8007700/,"There are currently no validated surrogate endpoints for breast cancer. The identification and establishment of a biomarker as a valid surrogate for cancer is a stepwise process. Promising markers should be added to current and planned, large, traditionally designed chemoprevention trials.","Markers of early events in the development of breast cancer are potential candidates for surrogate endpoints in chemoprevention trials. There are many such markers and the challenge is to identify truly relevant markers. If successful, surrogate endpoints offer several potential benefits in the conduct of prevention trials, including: shorter latency and hence shorter trials; reductions in size and cost of trials; and the opportunity to study prevention measures where use of primary outcomes would be excessively invasive or unethical. Although there are currently no validated surrogate endpoints for breast cancer, criteria for the discovery and validation of surrogates have been proposed. Putative surrogate endpoints should be biologically plausible, represent an early event in the causal pathway, be measurable by a standardized and reliable assay, and exhibit a dose-response. Perhaps most importantly, surrogates should statistically capture the effect of the intervention on outcome. The identification and establishment of a biomarker as a valid surrogate for cancer is a stepwise process that involves both smaller ""transitional"" studies and larger second-generation chemoprevention trials in which both primary outcome and putative surrogates are measured. Transitional studies are used to move new markers from the laboratory into use in human populations, and are designed to address specific questions of assay validity, treatment/marker associations, marker/disease associations, and inter- and intra-individual variability. Promising markers should be added to current and planned, large, traditionally designed chemoprevention trials in order to definitively address the issues of optimal representation, and to test the adequacy with which the marker(s) captures the effect of treatment on outcome.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Little is known about the feasibility of implementing these recommendations or how low-income women of color might respond to individualized risk assessment (IRA) performed by primary care providers (PCPs). Women recruited from a federally qualified health center were given the option to discuss BC risk status with their PCP. Comprehensive IRA was performed using a software tool designed for the primary care environment combining three assessment instruments and providing risk-adapted recommendations for screening, prevention, and genetic referral. Logistic regression models assessed factors associated with wanting to learn and discuss BC risk with PCP. Of 237 participants, only 12.7% (n = 30) did not want to discuss IRA results with their PCP. Factors associated with lower odds of wanting to learn results included having private insurance and reporting ever having had a mammogram. Factors associated with higher odds of wanting to learn results included older age (50 to 69 years) and increased BC worry. For all women wishing to learn results, IRA was successfully completed and delivered to the PCP immediately before the encounter for incorporation into the well-visit evaluation. Incorporation of US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations as part of routine primary care is feasible. Interest in IRA seems high among underserved women. This approach warrants further investigation as a strategy for addressing disparities in BC mortality."
Fenretinide (4-HPR): a preventive chance for women at genetic and familial risk?,"Cazzaniga, Varricchio, Montefrancesco, Feroce, Guerrieri-Gonzaga","Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22500077/,Fenretinide (4-HPR) is the most studied retinoid in breast cancer chemoprevention clinical trials. This agent showed a significative reduction of the incidence of second breast tumors in premenopausal women confirmed after 15-year followups.,"The incidence and mortality of breast cancer have been recently influenced by several new therapeutic strategies. In particular our knowledge on cancer precursors, risk biomarkers, and genetics has considerably increased, and prevention strategies are being successfully explored. Since their discovery, retinoids, the natural and synthetic derivatives of vitamin A, have been known to play a crucial role in cell and tissue differentiation and their ability to inhibit carcinogenesis has made them the ideal chemopreventive agents studied in several preclinical and clinical trials. Fenretinide (4-HPR) is the most studied retinoid in breast cancer chemoprevention clinical trials due to its selective accumulation in breast tissue and its favorable toxicological profile. This agent showed a significative reduction of the incidence of second breast tumors in premenopausal women confirmed after 15-year followups. Considering Fenretinide protective action, a similar trend on ovarian cancer, this drug warrants reevaluations as a preventive agent for high-risk young women, such as BRCA-1 and 2 mutation carriers or with a high familial risk. This favorable effect therefore provides a strong rationale for a primary prevention trial in these unaffected cohort of women."
Stage matters: choosing relevant model systems to address hypotheses in diet and cancer chemoprevention research.,"Fenton, Hord","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16474168/," Clinical evidence reveals that the efficacy of dietary factors to prevent cancer is probably stage-dependent.

The ability to demonstrate stage-specific effects of dietary compounds on normal, preneoplastic and malignant cell models may provide insights into puzzling clinical results from cancer chemoprevention trials. The relevance of these models to the field of cancer prevention is immense and will undoubtedly facilitate the ability to discover which dietary factors are most effective at preventing cancer and which, if any, specific steps in neoplastic transformation render cells refractory to the effects of dietary compounds. There are illustrative examples where exposure of high-risk individuals to dietary chemopreventive agents increases rather than decreases cancer risk. While geneticists and clinical oncologists acknowledge the morphological continuum along which tumors develop in specific tissues, tumor cells, rather than normal and preneoplastic cells, continue to be the primary in vitro reductionist tool employed to elucidate mechanisms underlying disease progression and to investigate the potential utility of dietary as well as other chemopreventive agents. Currently, there are few relevant model systems to study the progression of neoplastic transformation, especially in epithelial cells. We highlight examples of model systems isolated from prostate, breast, endometrial and intestinal tissue, with special emphasis on a specific set of non-tumorigenic, conditionally immortal cell lines derived from C57/BL6 mice [YAMC (Young Adult Mouse Colon cells; Apc+/+) cells and IMCE (Immorto-Min Colonic Epithelium cells; ApcMin/+) cells] that have yielded important information on early events in colorectal neoplasia development. These cell lines are an illustrative example of how researchers can examine stage-dependent effects of specific dietary components on carcinogenesis. The utilization of cell culture systems modeling early, middle and late stages of tumorigenesis will yield important insights into mechanisms by which dietary components impact cancer progression."

An important question for funding agencies is whether the conduct of large chemoprevention trials provides strong scientific return on investment. We evaluated the scientific impact of four large chemoprevention trials - two for breast cancer and two for prostate cancer - using citation analysis, a bibliometric technique. The results were compared to the scientific impact of a series of treatment trials conducted over the same 20-year time period (1991-2010, inclusive). Average annual citation counts were compared using t-tests. Scientific impact was also assessed relative to trial costs. Twenty-seven treatment trials with 17,208 patients and four chemoprevention trials with 87,550 patients were examined. The mean annual citation rate for primary articles was higher for chemoprevention trials compared to treatment trials (188.1 vs. 40.4, p = .001). For both primary and secondary article publications, mean annual citations for articles associated with chemoprevention trials were also higher (483.9 vs. 69.0, p = .0003). Large chemoprevention trials were estimated to provide 50% more total citations from primary and secondary articles on a cost-adjusted basis. Based on these criteria, the scientific impact of large phase III cancer chemoprevention trials was very high in absolute terms, and as good as or better than that of treatment trials after accounting for expenditure. For appropriate scientific questions, large chemoprevention trials provide a good scientific return on investment for federal funding agencies."

Six chemoprevention agents were identified: tamoxifen, raloxifene, arzoxifene, lasofoxifene, exemestane, and anastrozole. In women at increased risk of BC age ≥ 35 years, tamoxifen (20 mg per day for 5 years) should be discussed as an option to reduce the risk of estrogen receptor (ER) -positive BC. In postmenopausal women, raloxifene (60 mg per day for 5 years) and exemestane (25 mg per day for 5 years) should also be discussed as options for BC risk reduction. Those at increased BC risk are defined as individuals with a 5-year projected absolute risk of BC ≥ 1.66% (based on the National Cancer Institute BC Risk Assessment Tool or an equivalent measure) or women diagnosed with lobular carcinoma in situ. Use of other selective ER modulators or other aromatase inhibitors to lower BC risk is not recommended outside of a clinical trial. Health care providers are encouraged to discuss the option of chemoprevention among women at increased BC risk. The discussion should include the specific risks and benefits associated with each chemopreventive agent."
Adjuvant tamoxifen therapy for early stage breast cancer and second primary malignancies.

However, concerns have been raised that the drug may increase the incidence of new primary malignancies, such as endometrial, liver, and colorectal cancers. Our goal was to assess the carcinogenic risks associated with long-term use of tamoxifen in women with early stage breast cancer. The incidence of new primary cancers among 2729 women participants of the Stockholm Trial was determined at a median follow-up of 9 years. In this trial, after primary surgery, postmenopausal patients aged less than 71 years with unilateral invasive breast cancer were randomly allocated to receive either 2 years of adjuvant tamoxifen (40 mg daily) or no adjuvant endocrine therapy. Information on second cancers was obtained by retrospective linkage to the Swedish Cancer Registry. To increase statistical power, a joint analysis of the incidence of endometrial and gastrointestinal cancers was performed in the following three major studies in Scandinavia evaluating adjuvant tamoxifen therapy: the Stockholm Trial, the Danish Breast Cancer Group Trial, and the South-Swedish Trial. These studies included a total of 4914 patients with a median follow-up of 8-9 years. All P values were calculated from two-tailed tests of statistical significance. In the Stockholm Trial, there was a statistically significant (P = .008) reduction in the incidence of second primary cancers in the contralateral breast among the tamoxifen-treated patients. However, there was a nearly sixfold increase in endometrial cancers (P < .001) and a threefold increase in gastrointestinal cancers in the tamoxifen-treated patients. The results of the joint studies showed a statistically significant increase in endometrial cancers among the tamoxifen-treated patients (relative risk [RR] = 4.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.9-8.9). There was also an excess of gastrointestinal cancers associated with tamoxifen. Most of this excess involved colorectal cancers (RR = 1.9; 95% CI = 1.1-3.3) and stomach cancer (RR = 3.2; 95% CI = 0.9-11.7). There was no substantial increase in any other type of gastrointestinal cancer (e.g., liver cancer) among the tamoxifen-treated patients. The endometrium and gastrointestinal organs may be target sites for tamoxifen-induced carcinogenesis in humans. The increased incidence of colorectal and stomach cancers reported here should be regarded as tentative until supported by long-term data from a larger number of tamoxifen trials. Also, appropriate surveillance of cancer incidence is warranted for the protection of participants enrolled in current tamoxifen chemoprevention trials."

Because there has been limited work on chemoprevention of treatment-related secondary cancers, this minireview will focus on chemoprevention of second cancers with lifestyle/genetic origins. Trials aimed at preventing second cancers in patients with tobacco-related cancers (head and neck, lung), skin cancers, breast cancer, and colorectal adenomatous polyps have been completed with some success. However, one finding that has emerged is that, across several cancer sites, subgroups are found with differential response to the chemopreventive agent. For example, smoking status, alcohol consumption, nutritional status, and host tumor characteristics seem to modify chemopreventive efficacy. Stratum-specific (subgroup) findings may occur by chance, requiring a need for supportive evidence from observational epidemiologic studies of the agent (where available), mechanistic studies, or results of other related trials. Although chemoprevention of second cancers has been realized, it has become increasingly apparent that not all benefit equally. The finding of subgroup effects in completed trials results in the need to consider such subgroup effects in the design of future trials, by either restricting enrollment to particular subgroups (e.g., never or former smokers), or by increasing sample size requirements to allow for variation in response in subgroups in a statistically powerful way."

The reasons for low uptake may be related to women’s knowledge or attitudes towards the drugs. We aimed to examine the impact of an online breast cancer chemoprevention decision aid (DA) on informed intentions and decisions of women at high risk of breast cancer. We conducted a randomized clinical trial, assessing the effect of a DA about breast cancer chemoprevention on informed choices about chemoprevention. Women (n = 585), 46- to 74-years old old, completed online baseline, post-test, and three-month follow-up questionnaires. Participants were randomly assigned to either an intervention group, a standard control group that answered questions about chemoprevention at baseline, or a three-month control group that did not answer questions about chemoprevention at baseline. The main outcome measures were whether women’s intentions and decisions regarding chemoprevention drugs were informed, and whether women who viewed the DA were more likely to make informed decisions than women who did not view the DA, using a dichotomous composite variable ‘informed choice’ (yes/no) to classify informed decisions as those reflecting sufficient knowledge and concordance between a woman’s decision and relevant attitudes. Analyses showed that more intervention than standard control participants (52.7% versus 5.9%) made informed decisions at post-test, P <0.001. At the three-month follow-up, differences in rates of informed choice between intervention (16.9%) and both control groups (11.8% and 8.0%) were statistically non-significant, P = 0.067. The DA increased informed decision making about breast cancer chemoprevention, although the impact on knowledge diminished over time. This study was not designed to determine how much knowledge decision makers must retain over time. Examining informed decisions increases understanding of the impact of DAs. A standard for defining and measuring sufficient knowledge for informed decisions is needed. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00967824"
Antibiotic treatment and prophylaxis of periprosthetic infections: Evaluation of 666 consecutive breast implant removals.,"Lohmeyer, Jakob, Keck, Wittig",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33308989/,Periprosthetic infections are feared complications in esthetic and reconstructive breast surgery. The purpose of this study is to evaluate our institution's specific culture data and to identify most common organisms and suitable antibiotics for prophylaxis and first-line treatment.,"Periprosthetic infections are feared complications in esthetic and reconstructive breast surgery. The purpose of our study is to evaluate our institution's specific culture data and to identify most common organisms and suitable antibiotics for prophylaxis and first-line treatment. We evaluated all patients with a change or removal of breast implants from 01.01.2012 to 31.12.2017 retrospectively. Based on the medical records, the surgical indications were identified and specifically analyzed for signs of infection, reasons for primary and secondary surgery, and all available microbiological data of these interventions. A total of 666 implant removals or exchanges were performed in 431 patients. Microbiological smears were gathered from 291 patients (449 implants). Bacteria were cultured from 63 implants (56 patients). In six additional patients (ten implants), a periprosthetic infection was seen, without bacteria detection. Advanced capsular contracture correlated with a higher proportion of positive swabs (p<0.05). In 11.5% of smears, bacterial contamination was found despite absence of clinical signs of infection. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were the dominant pathogen in clinical inapparent infections, while Staphylococcus aureus was when there was clinical evidence of infection. All pathogens were sensitive to vancomycin. In the majority of cases, bacterial contamination was an incidental finding, which was more common in the presence of advanced capsular contracture. In our institution, cefuroxime and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid have been proven to be reasonable choices for prevention and treatment of periprosthetic infections. In the treatment of fulminant infections and for the prophylaxis during implant replacement due to advanced capsular contracture, vancomycin became our first choice."

A personal and family health history based HRA with integrated guideline-based clinical decision support (CDS) was completed by each participant prior to their appointment. Risk reports were provided to patients and providers to discuss at their clinical encounter. provider and patient discussion and provider uptake (i.e. ordering) and patient uptake (i.e. recommendation completion) of CDS recommendations. patient and provider surveys and EMR data. One thousand eight hundred twenty nine participants (mean age 56.2 [SD13.9], 69.6% female) completed the HRA and had EMR data available for analysis. 762 (41.6%) received a recommendation (29.7% for genetic counseling (GC); 15.2% for enhanced breast/colon cancer screening). Those with recommendations frequently discussed disease risk with their provider (8.7%-38.2% varied by recommendation, p-values ≤ 0.004). In the GC subgroup, provider discussions increased referrals to counseling (44.4% with vs. 5.9% without, P < 0.001). Recommendation uptake was highest for colon cancer screening (provider = 67.9%; patient = 86.8%) and lowest for breast cancer chemoprevention (0%). Systematic health risk assessment revealed that almost half the population were at increased disease risk based on guidelines. Risk identification resulted in shared discussions between participants and providers but variable clinical action uptake depending upon the recommendation. Understanding the barriers and facilitators to uptake by both patients and providers will be essential for optimizing HRA tools and achieving their promise of improving population health.

Baseline BMI was calculated from nurse assessed height and weight measurements for premenopausal (n = 3138) and postmenopausal (n = 3731) women in IBIS-I and postmenopausal women in IBIS-II (n = 3787). The primary endpoint was any breast cancer event (invasive and ductal carcinoma in situ). We used Cox proportional hazards regression to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) for risk after adjustment for covariates. There were 582 (IBIS-I) and 248 (IBIS-II) breast cancer events [median follow-up = 16.2 years (IQR 14.4-17.7) and 10.9 years (IQR 8.8-13.0), respectively]. In adjusted analysis, women with a higher BMI had an increased breast cancer risk in both IBIS-I [HR = 1.06 per 5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (0.99-1.15), p = 0.114] and in IBIS-II [HR per 5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> = 1.21 (1.09-1.35), p < 0.001]. In IBIS-I, the association between BMI and breast cancer risk was positive in postmenopausal women [adjusted HR per 5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> = 1.14 (1.03-1.26), p = 0.01] but not premenopausal women [adjusted HR per 5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> = 0.97 (0.86-1.09), p = 0.628]. There was no interaction between BMI and treatment group for breast cancer risk in either IBIS-I (p = 0.62) or IBIS-II (p = 0.55). Higher BMI is associated with greater breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women at increased risk of the disease, but no effect was observed in premenopausal women.

The objective of this study is to analyze the extracts of A. officinarum to quantify flavonoids and to evaluate the growth inhibitory effects of the extracts on MCF-7 and LNCaP cells. A. officinarum aqueous and hydroalcoholic extracts were analyzed by using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) for the quantification of three flavonoid compounds. Then, MCF-7, LNCaP, and fibroblast cells were treated with several concentrations (25, 50, 100, 200, and 400 μg/mL) of extracts (24, 48 and 72h). Cell viability was assessed using an MTT assay. Flow cytometry was conducted to evaluate apoptosis. Galangin and kaempferol (3.85 and 1.57 mg/g dry extract) were quantified, respectively, in hydroalcoholic and aqueous extracts using a validated method. The hydroalcoholic extract significantly decreased the viability of MCF-7 (IC50: 43.45μg/mL for 48h) and LNCaP cells (IC50: 168 μg/mL for 48h). The aqueous extract reduced cancer cell viability by more than 50% only at 200 and 400 μg/mL (72 h). Treatment of primary fibroblasts with both extracts showed no significant decrease in cell viability (25-100 μg/mL; 24 and 48h). The hydroalcoholic extract induced a significant increase in apoptotic cells in both MCF-7 and LNCaP cells. Obtained results demonstrated the cytotoxicity of A. officinarum through apoptosis induction in two cancer cell lines. Further investigations are required to determine the underlying apoptotic cell death mechanisms induced by A. officinarum in cancerous cells."

Study characteristics, cytological group distribution, and incidence of breast cancer. Thirty articles were included after full-text review, of which 16 were analyzed, containing data on 20,808 unique aspirations from over 17,378 subjects. Seven (44%) of the studies used the King cytological classification system. Among aspirations from women free of breast cancer, 51.5% contained fluid, in which over 27.7% had PED on cytology. In the two prospective studies of 7850 cancer-free women, abnormal cytology by NAF carried a 2.1-fold higher risk (95% CI, 1.6-2.6; p < 0.001) of developing breast cancer, compared with women from whom no fluid could be obtained. PED-NAF among women free of breast cancer, compared with no fluid being obtained, has an independent risk of developing breast cancer comparable to the risk of a woman with a positive family history of breast cancer. These findings have implications for augmenting risk prediction and clinical decisions concerning breast cancer surveillance and chemoprevention. As with all reviews, heterogeneity across studies may have influenced the results. The limited literature calls for prospective studies on asymptomatic women with long-term follow-up."

In addition to continuing, with more and more expensive efforts to develop new and more effective cancer treatments, it is health-politically and medico-professionally important to realise that only successful approaches to primary cancer prevention of major and frequent cancer types will be able to change this socially and economically unfavourably outlook. It is therefore encouraging to see that primary (or pharmacologic, interventional) cancer prevention programs have been successfully developed over the past decade for individuals at elevated risk for breast and prostate cancer on the basis of several scientifically well-conducted, prospective chemoprevention trials, mainly with synthetic anti-hormones (anti-estrogens and anti-androgens) in the USA, in Europe and Australia. This paper summarises the presently published results and design of several completed and some currently running primary cancer prevention trials in breast cancer and prostate cancer, and also points to the important obstacles for their conduct and translation into general practice in the broader populations at risk outside of clinical prevention research."

Blocking progesterone signaling by the pharmacologic inhibitor mifepristone or by genetic deletion of the progesterone receptor (PR) effectively suppressed HGSC development and its peritoneal metastases.

Prophylaxis approach to a-symptomatic post-menopausal women: breast cancer.,"Aguas, Martins, Gomes, de Sousa, Silva, ","Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16126355/,"Lifestyle changes, exercise or diet could play a role in primary prevention of breast cancer. Regular exercise, ingestion of adequate amounts of fruit and vegetables, limiting alcohol consumption, avoidance of obesity in post-menopausal women, and perhaps the use of olive oil may all have a protective effect.","Breast cancer is the most common cancer of women worldwide. Its frequency increases throughout the female lifespan. Epidemiological research has clearly identified important reproductive risk factors for breast cancer, including age at menarche, age at menopause, age at first-term pregnancy and nulliparity, which provide important clues to the hormonal origin of this disease. The widespread use of exogenous sex steroids as contraceptive agents and as hormonal replacement therapy has been a source of concern and generates discussion about their effects on breast health. Lifestyle changes, exercise or diet could play a role in primary prevention of breast cancer. Regular exercise, ingestion of adequate amounts of fruit and vegetables, limiting alcohol consumption, avoidance of obesity in post-menopausal women, and perhaps the use of olive oil, may all have a protective effect and should be considered by women. There is insufficient scientific evidence of the role played by phyto-oestrogens on breast cancer risk. Other preventive measures that include the use of drugs such as statins or aspirin should not be recommended until we have more information about their effects on the breast. Especially for high-risk women, all the aforementioned measures may be not enough, and chemo-prevention should be considered. The use of selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) to reduce breast cancer risk is still being evaluated. Tamoxifen was the first SERM approved for the reduction of breast cancer incidence in women at high risk. However its use has limitations, due to significant side effects. Raloxifene has been approved for the prevention and treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis and has provided excellent indications of breast cancer risk reduction, with a more favourable profile than tamoxifen."
Fenretinide in breast-cancer chemoprevention (review).,"Decensi, Formelli, Torrisi, Depalo, Costa",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21607448/,"Fenretinide (4-HPR), a synthetic amide derivative of retinoic acid, has proven effective in preventing chemically induced mammary carcinoma in rodents. Accrual of the phase III study was closed on July 31, 1993 including 2,972 Stage I breast cancer patients.","Fenretinide (4-HPR), a synthetic amide derivative of retinoic acid, has proven effective in preventing chemically induced mammary carcinoma in rodents. During the past years, our group has made a particular effort with regard to this molecule in clinical studies aimed at evaluating its pharmacology, toxicity and efficacy in breast cancer prevention. We have demonstrated that 4-HPR blood levels remain constant during administration for as long as 5 years, that the drug accumulates in the human breast, and that it induces a significant decline of plasma retinol and insulinlike growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels. Accrual of the phase III study was closed on July 31, 1993 including 2,972 Stage I breast cancer patients. The aim is to evaluate the efficacy of a 5-year administration of 4-HPR to prevent new contralateral primary breast cancers. Compliance to protocol and treatment is high and tolerability of the drug is good; only 51 women out of 1,397 (3.6%) have interrupted drug intake due to toxicity. The only remarkable adverse effect of 4-HPR administration is diminished dark adaptation, which occurs in about one-fourth of the patients and is dependent on the decline of plasma retinol below the threshold level of 100 ng/ml. However, about 50% of the patients with altered dark-adaptometry are asymptomatic and the alterations of dark adaptation are promptly reversible upon drug discontinuation. Plasma level of N-(4-methoxyphenyl) retinamide (4-MPR), the principal metabolite of 4-HPR, which tends to be higher in women over 55 years with a high percentage of adipose tissue, is the major determinant of both retinol and IGF-I decrease. Since the combination of 4-HPR with the antioestrogen tamoxifen has shown a synergistic activity in preclinical models, it is currently an important avenue of clinical investigation in an attempt to prevent breast cancer. Moreover, a dose reduction of one or both agents in an effort to minimise toxicity while maintaining activity, would represent a major improvement in cancer chemoprevention."

Estimates of the risks and benefits of tamoxifen based on results from clinical trials may not reflect the real-world experience. The authors determined the prevalence of women in a community-based cohort who would meet the definition of high risk for breast carcinoma and calculated the number of women needed to screen to determine one for whom the benefits of tamoxifen would outweigh the risks. Baseline incidence also was examined for adverse health events in this community-based cohort compared with participants in the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial. The study participants were women ages 40-70 years (n = 6048 women) who were members of the CLUE II cohort, which started in 1989, and who responded to questionnaire surveys in 1996 and 2000. Eighteen percent of all women had a 5-year risk of invasive breast carcinoma > or = 1.66%. The number of women needed to screen to find 1 woman for whom the benefits outweighed the risks of tamoxifen ranged from 26 women ages 40-49 years to 142 women ages 60-70 years. For women who had undergone a hysterectomy, the numbers needed to screen were lower. Baseline incidence rates of fracture and thromboembolic disease were higher in the community-based cohort compared with the rates observed among prevention trial participants; thus, fewer women had to be treated with tamoxifen to prevent one fracture. However, fewer women in the community also had to be treated to observe harm with a thromboembolic event. Clinicians who counsel women about tamoxifen should take into consideration community-level risks and benefits."

We assessed the efficacy and safety of the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole for prevention of breast cancer in postmenopausal women who are at high risk of the disease. Between Feb 2, 2003, and Jan 31, 2012, we recruited postmenopausal women aged 40-70 years from 18 countries into an international, double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled trial. To be eligible, women had to be at increased risk of breast cancer (judged on the basis of specific criteria). Eligible women were randomly assigned (1:1) by central computer allocation to receive 1 mg oral anastrozole or matching placebo every day for 5 years. Randomisation was stratified by country and was done with blocks (size six, eight, or ten). All trial personnel, participants, and clinicians were masked to treatment allocation; only the trial statistician was unmasked. The primary endpoint was histologically confirmed breast cancer (invasive cancers or non-invasive ductal carcinoma in situ). Analyses were done by intention to treat. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN31488319. 1920 women were randomly assigned to receive anastrozole and 1944 to placebo. After a median follow-up of 5·0 years (IQR 3·0-7·1), 40 women in the anastrozole group (2%) and 85 in the placebo group (4%) had developed breast cancer (hazard ratio 0·47, 95% CI 0·32-0·68, p<0·0001). The predicted cumulative incidence of all breast cancers after 7 years was 5·6% in the placebo group and 2·8% in the anastrozole group. 18 deaths were reported in the anastrozole group and 17 in the placebo group, and no specific causes were more common in one group than the other (p=0·836). Anastrozole effectively reduces incidence of breast cancer in high-risk postmenopausal women. This finding, along with the fact that most of the side-effects associated with oestrogen deprivation were not attributable to treatment, provides support for the use of anastrozole in postmenopausal women at high risk of breast cancer.

Outcome measures were incidence of FN; treatment-related hospitalizations; chemotherapy dose delays, reductions, and discontinuations; and adverse events from prophylaxis. Of 2,205 identified citations, eight studies (n = 1,250) met our eligibility criteria. Three additional studies (n = 293) were identified from a prior systematic review. Three randomized controlled trials (n = 576), one phase IV single-arm trial (n = 69), one prospective observational study (n = 37), and six retrospective studies (n = 861) were identified. Agents investigated were pegfilgrastim (n = 108), filgrastim (n = 1,119), and ciprofloxacin (n = 89). The heterogeneity of studies meant that a narrative synthesis of results was performed. Median FN rates for patients who received FEC-D with and without primary prophylaxis were 10.1% (interquartile range [IQR], 3.9% to 22.6%) and 23.9% (IQR, 9.2% to 27.3%), respectively. In the absence of primary prophylaxis, FN was more common during docetaxel than during FEC.

Toxicity from prophylaxis itself was rarely reported. Primary FN prophylaxis is effective in patients who receive FEC-D chemotherapy. The paucity of prospective data makes optimal recommendations about the choice and timing of prophylaxis challenging."

The strengths and weaknesses of preventive exemestane as evaluated in the MAP.3 trial are discussed as are relevant areas for future consideration.,"Development of drugs to prevent breast cancer has focused largely on anti-estrogenic agents, leading to approval by the US FDA of two such agents for this purpose: tamoxifen and raloxifene. However, the uptake of these drugs by high-risk women and their primary care physicians has been limited, due in large part to a perceived unfavorable risk:benefit balance. The current focus is on aromatase inhibitors, which appear to have more acceptable side effects in addition to being more efficacious in reducing breast cancer risk in high-risk women. The placebo-controlled phase III MAP.3 trial tested the AI exemestane in high-risk women and documented a 65% relative reduction in total and a 73% reduction in ER-positive breast cancers in the intervention compared to the placebo group. Toxicities centered around musculoskeletal side effects, but in the relatively short 35-month median follow-up period, these did not impair quality-of-life. A bone study nested within MAP.3 demonstrated significant decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) and in structural parameters of bone quality. The strengths and weaknesses of preventive exemestane as evaluated in the MAP.3 trial are discussed as are relevant areas for future consideration: influence of obesity, alternative dosing, and biomarker use in phase III prevention trials of aromatase inhibitors."

Prophylactic surgery is the rational approach for women who carry the BRCA mutation. Chemoprevention and/or intensified surveillance represent alternative approaches.,"Advances in understanding molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying cancer promise an ""individualized"" management of the disease. Women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 germ-line mutation are at very high risk of breast and/or ovarian cancer. Because high-quality data are lacking from randomized trials, prevention strategies and treatment of patients with BRCA-associated breast cancer are complex. The data for this review were obtained by searching PubMed and Medline for articles about optimizing prevention and treating women with familial susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer. Prophylactic surgery is the rational approach for women who carry the BRCA mutation; chemoprevention and/or intensified surveillance represent alternative approaches. Prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is superior to bilateral prophylactic mastectomy. However, reaching a definitive clinical decision is complex, and several variables should be considered for an individualized approach. Accumulating data support the concept of more extensive surgery for newly diagnosed breast cancer in women with a BRCA mutation but new unbaised studies are needed for an evidence-based approach . Such patients treated with breast conservation therapy for early-stage breast cancer are at higher risk of contralateral breast cancer than noncarriers. Primary bilateral mastectomy could also be considered and discussed with these patients. Breast tumors from BRCA1 mutation carriers are predominantly of basal subtype (i.e., triple negative), and BRCA2 mutation carriers are of luminal subtype (i.e., estrogen receptor positive). Decisions on adjuvant treatment are based on estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2 status. The complex management of healthy women and breast cancer patients with familial susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer requires an individualized prevention or treatment strategy by an experienced team."
Tamoxifen for breast cancer prevention: a framework for clinical decisions.,"Cykert, Phifer, Hansen","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15339751/,"Tamoxifen chemoprevention is cost-effective for women aged 40-50 years. Whether this holds true for older women depends on the initial breast cancer risk, fear of breast cancer, and presence of the uterus. Primary care providers, including gynecologists, will need to counsel patients.","Given the potential side effects and an uncertain survival benefit, decisions about tamoxifen treatment for the primary prevention of breast cancer remain complex. Primary care providers, including gynecologists, will need to counsel patients regarding this form of preventive care. In this report, we update cost-effectiveness calculations for tamoxifen chemoprevention and establish reasonable parameters for clinicians' use. We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis that compared women aged 50 years who were treated with tamoxifen for 5 years with an untreated cohort. In the base model, we assumed a 3.4% 5-year breast cancer risk. Quality-of-life estimates for important outcomes (breast cancer, endometrial cancer, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, stroke, metastatic cancer, and hot flushes) were obtained from 106 women. Probabilities and costs of outcomes were derived from the Breast Cancer Chemoprevention Trial and other published estimates. Broad sensitivity analyses were performed. Cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained as a result of tamoxifen breast cancer prevention was the main outcome measure. The use of tamoxifen led to a remaining life expectancy of 26.07 quality-adjusted life-years compared with 25.97 without treatment. The cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained was $43,300. Sensitivity analysis revealed that younger age, the absence of the uterus, higher initial risk of breast cancer, increased fear of curable breast cancer, and reduced tamoxifen cost further favored treatment. Tamoxifen chemoprevention is cost-effective for women aged 40-50 years who are at significant breast cancer risk. Whether this holds true for older women depends on the initial breast cancer risk, fear of breast cancer, and presence of the uterus."
Cascade genetic testing: an underutilized pathway to equitable cancer care?,"Wilke, Bednar, Pirzadeh-Miller, Lahiri, Scarinci, Leath Iii, Frey, Lu, Rauh-Hain","Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38748383/,"Cascade genetic testing represents a powerful application of precision medicine. It involves the process of familial diffusion or the ""cascade"" of genomic risk information. First degree relatives have a 50% likelihood of carrying the same cancer-associated mutation.","The Precision Medicine Initiative was launched upon the potential of genomic information to tailor medical care. Cascade genetic testing represents a powerful application of precision medicine and involves the process of familial diffusion or the ""cascade"" of genomic risk information. When an individual (proband) is found to carry a cancer-associated germline pathogenic mutation, the information should be cascaded or shared with at-risk relatives. First degree relatives have a 50% likelihood of carrying the same cancer-associated mutation. This process of cascade testing offers at-risk relatives the opportunity for genetic testing and, for those who also carry the cancer-associated mutation, genetically targeted primary disease prevention through intensive cancer surveillance, chemoprevention and risk-reducing surgery, reducing morbidity and preventing mortality. Cascade testing has been designated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a Tier 1 genomic application for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. In this manuscript we describe a cascade genetic testing and in particular focus on its potential to provide necessary care to medically underserved and vulnerable populations."

The present analysis refers to preliminary data on safety, IGF-I, and breast cancer events. Patients were included if they had an excised ductal carcinoma-in-situ (57%), lobular carcinoma-in-situ (13%), minimal invasive breast cancer (7%), or a 5-year Gail risk > or = 1.3% (23%). After a median follow-up of 40 months, there was a reduction of 13%, 2%, 20%, and 1% in IGF-I levels for patients on tamoxifen, fenretinide, tamoxifen plus fenretinide, and placebo, respectively. Recruitment was stopped based on the lack of an interaction on IGF-I levels, which was a primary end point for the study. Thirty-six patients have dropped out of the study, 17 because of adverse events and 19 for various other reasons. One stage I endometrial cancer occurred in a patient on fenretinide, and one optic nerve ischemia and one deep venous thrombosis occurred on tamoxifen. There was no difference in menopausal symptoms, endometrial thickness, polyps, or ovarian cysts among treatment arms. To date, 24 breast cancers have been observed, without differences among arms. The combination of low-dose tamoxifen and fenretinide is safe but not synergistic in lowering IGF-I levels in premenopausal women. The clinical implications require further follow-up."

Dietary factors are through to contribute to as much as one-third of the factors influencing the development of cancer. Ones of the components of a plant-based diet are beta-sitosterol and taraxasterol, compounds attracting our specific attention. This review summarizes the biological activities of presented phytosterols (anti-inflammatory, cholesterol-lowering, anti-microbial, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal effects). Our interest has been focussed especially on their anti-tumor and chemopreventive activity. They have been shown experimentally to inhibit colon and breast cancer development. They act at various stages of tumor development, including inhibition of tumorigenesis, inhibition of tumor promotion, and induction of cell differentiation. They effectively inhibit invasion of tumor cells and metastasis. With regard to toxicity, no obvious side effects of phytosterols have been observed in studies to date, with the exception of individuals with phytosterolemia. The exact mechanism by which dietary phytosterols act is not fully understood. However, some mechanisms have been offered. Therefore, they have a bright future in clinical application. Further investigation to explore their potential in tumor treatment may prove to be worthwhile."

Resulting risk estimates are presented in simple language and graphic formats for easy comprehension. iPrevent(®) then presents risk-adapted, evidence-based, guideline-endorsed management options. Development was an iterative process with regular feedback from multidisciplinary experts and consumers. To verify iPrevent(®), risk factor data for 127 cases derived from the Australian Breast Cancer Family Study were entered into iPrevent(®), IBIS (v7.02), and BOADICEA (v3.0). Consistency of the model chosen by iPrevent(®) (i.e., IBIS or BOADICEA) with the programmed iPrevent(®) model choice algorithm was assessed. Estimated breast cancer risks from iPrevent(®) were compared with those attained directly from the chosen risk assessment model (IBIS or BOADICEA). Risk management interventions displayed by iPrevent(®) were assessed for appropriateness. Risk estimation model choice was 100 % consistent with the programmed iPrevent(®) logic. Discrepant 10-year and residual lifetime risk estimates of >1 % were found for 1 and 4 cases, respectively, none was clinically significant (maximal variation 1.4 %). Risk management interventions suggested by iPrevent(®) were 100 % appropriate. iPrevent(®) successfully integrates the IBIS and BOADICEA risk assessment models into a decision support tool that provides evidence-based, risk-adapted risk management advice. This may help to facilitate precision breast cancer prevention discussions between women and their healthcare providers."
Current strategies for anticancer chemoprevention and chemoprotection.,Krzystyniak,"Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12669776/,"Chemoprevention through interruption of multistage careinogenesis include different molecular targets. Relatively new targets in drug design projects in cancer pharmacology include cytostatic agents, immune system modulators, and angiogenesis inhibitors.","Relatively new targets in drug design projects in cancer pharmacology include cytostatic agents, immune system modulators, and angiogenesis inhibitors. Preventive oncology applies pharmacological agents to reverse, retard, or halt progression of neoplastic cells to invasive malignancy. Prevention of cancer, however, can be accomplished through many strategies, including changes in diet and lifestyle. For example, the vast majority of lung cancers (80-90%) can be attributed to cigarette smoking and therefore, the most effective primary preventive strategy for lung cancer is to quit smoking. Chemoprevention through interruption of multistage careinogenesis include different molecular targets. Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) act as estrogen receptor (ER) agonists. Ligands for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) suppress breast carcinogenesis in experimental models and induce differentiation of human liposarcoma cells. Selective PPAR modulators (SPARMs), by analogy to the SERM concept, are designed to have desired effects on specific genes relevant to carcinogenesis. Enzymatic approach in endocrine-related tumors involve inhibition of aromatase to prevent breast cancer and inhibition of 5-alpha-reductase to prevent prostate cancer. Down-regulation of inflammatory prostaglandin synthesis by inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). inhibition of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and stimulation of phase II detoxication system, are currently examined in experimental models and clinical trials. Overall, potential targets in preventive strategies to reduce the risk of cancer involve agonists of endocrine receptors, factors down-regulating inflammation, factors inducing programmed cell death (PCD)/apoptosis, enzymatic inhibitors and gene therapy."

We consider high-risk women to be those with known BRCA mutations or a strong family history characterized by multiple relatives with breast cancer, early age at diagnosis, and in some families, ovarian cancer. We present existing data regarding prophylactic surgery for these women. Essentially, a woman at high risk for breast cancer may choose to undergo bilateral prophylactic mastectomy, with or without reconstruction. For patients who have a known breast cancer, contralateral mastectomy is also an option. Finally, for women in families with a strong incidence of ovarian cancer, prophylactic oophorectomy can be considered."

Tamoxifen citrate is the only approved chemopreventive agent for breast cancer. We sought to determine whether women are interested in taking a drug to prevent breast cancer and to assess the relationship between objective and subjective breast cancer risk and interest in chemoprevention. We conducted telephone interviews (November 3, 1997, to May 6, 1998) among a community sample of women aged 40 to 45 and 50 to 55 years enrolled in a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of a tailored mammography decision aid. Objective breast cancer risk was measured using the 5-year Gail score. Subjective breast cancer risk was measured using perceptions of absolute risk, perceptions of comparative risk, and worry about getting breast cancer. At 12-month follow-up (November 2, 1998, to July 20, 1999), we measured interest in taking a drug to prevent breast cancer. Among the 1273 women surveyed, 23% were interested in taking a drug to prevent breast cancer; 8% were potentially eligible for tamoxifen therapy (5-year Gail score > or = 1.66%). Eligibility for chemoprevention, based on the 5-year Gail score, was not associated with interest in taking a drug to prevent breast cancer. Women who were worried about breast cancer were 3 times more likely to be interested in taking a drug to prevent breast cancer than those who were not worried. Women's interest in chemoprevention might arise more from worries about getting breast cancer than from their objective risk factors."
Tamoxifen (TAM): the dispute goes on.,Grilli,"Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17033137/,Tamoxifen (TAM) has been used since early '70s as antitumor agent in the adjuvant therapy of breast carcinoma. The employment of TAM in chemoprevention of breast tumor in healthy and/or at-risk women by more than a decade has been contrasting by many scientists.,"Tamoxifen (TAM) has been used since early '70s as antitumor agent in the adjuvant therapy of breast carcinoma. The aim was (and is) to reduce the incidence of contralateral breast cancer in primary breast cancer bearing patients. Its efficacy was about 30% when estrogen and progesterone receptors were present in the malignant breast tumor and its use in antitumor therapy is, at the present time, rather correct. Viceversa, the employment of TAM in chemoprevention of breast tumor in healthy and/or at-risk women by more than a decade has been contrasting by many scientists and supporting by others. Indeed, TAM produces not only beneficial effects but also detrimental effects (mainly induction of endometrial cancer). According to the Author of this manuscript, TAM would not be used for primary or secondary mammary tumor chemoprevention. For such purposes the right way is to wait for conclusion of ongoing clinical trials on other pure antiestrogenic agents. Indeed, good candidates to act as an antiestrogen both in breast and in endometrial tissue are under validation. In the meanwhile, the scientific dispute goes on."
Molecular basis of the potential of vitamin D to prevent cancer.,"Ingraham, Bragdon, Nohe","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18034918/,"Research supports the hypothesis that the active form of vitamin D has significant, protective effects against the development of cancer. Vitamin D is a nuclear transcription factor that regulates cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis and a wide range of cellular mechanisms. The clinical research community is revising recommendations for optimal serum levels and for sensible levels of sun exposure.","To review current research findings in cell biology, epidemiology, preclinical, and clinical trials on the protective effects of vitamin D against the development of cancers of the breast, colon, prostate, lung, and ovary. Current recommendations for optimal vitamin D status, the movement towards revision of standards, and reflections on healthy exposure to sunlight are also reviewed. Search methodology: A literature search was conducted in April and updated in September 2007. The Medline and Web of Knowledge databases were searched for primary and review articles published between 1970 and 2007, using the search terms 'vitamin D', 'calcitriol', 'cancer', 'chemoprevention', 'nuclear receptor', 'vitamin D receptor', 'apoptosis', 'cell cycle', 'epidemiology', and 'cell adhesion molecule'. Articles that focused on epidemiological, preclinical, and clinical evidence for vitamin D's effects were selected and additional articles were obtained from reference lists of the retrieved articles. An increasing body of research supports the hypothesis that the active form of vitamin D has significant, protective effects against the development of cancer. Epidemiological studies show an inverse association between sun exposure, serum levels of 25(OH)D, and intakes of vitamin D and risk of developing and/or surviving cancer. The protective effects of vitamin D result from its role as a nuclear transcription factor that regulates cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis and a wide range of cellular mechanisms central to the development of cancer. A significant number of individuals have serum vitamin D levels lower than what appears to protect against cancer, and the research community is currently revising the guidelines for optimal health. This will lead to improved public health policies and to reduced risk of cancer. Research strongly supports the view that efforts to improve vitamin D status would have significant protective effects against the development of cancer. The clinical research community is currently revising recommendations for optimal serum levels and for sensible levels of sun exposure, to levels greater than previously thought. Currently, most experts in the field believe that intakes of between 1000 and 4000 IU will lead to a more healthy level of serum 25(OH)D, at approximately 75 nmol/L that will offer significant protection effects against cancers of the breast, colon, prostate, ovary, lungs, and pancreas. The first randomized trial has shown significant protection against breast cancer, and other clinical trials will follow and ultimately lead to improved public health policies and significantly fewer cancers."

Baseline and 1 year growth factor concentrations were not significantly different between treated and control groups. After a median follow-up of 65 months, an increase in TGF-beta 1 over 1 year was the only significant, independent predictor of a shorter survival free from secondary primary breast cancer. Moreover, the change in TGF-beta 1 levels had a tendency to influence the treatment effect on second breast cancer incidence. Our data suggest that the role of plasma TGF-beta 1 as a surrogate endpoint of breast carcinogenesis should be assessed further."

In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of weekly Swedish massage therapy (SMT) versus an active control condition (light touch [LT]) and waitlist control (WLC) on persistent CRF in breast cancer survivors. This early phase, randomized, single-masked, 6-week investigation of SMT, LT, and WLC enrolled 66 female stage 0-III breast cancer survivors (age range, 32-72 years) who had received surgery plus radiation and/or chemotherapy/chemoprevention with CRF (Brief Fatigue Inventory > 25). The primary outcome was the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI), with the National Institutes of Health PROMIS Fatigue scale secondary. Mean baseline MFI scores for 57 evaluable subjects were 62.95 for SMT, 55.00 for LT, and 60.41 for WLC. SMT resulted in a mean (standard deviation) 6-week reduction in MFI total scores of -16.50 (6.37) (n = 20) versus -8.06 (6.50) for LT (n = 20) and an increase of 5.88 (6.48) points for WLC (n = 17) (treatment-by-time P < .0001). The mean baseline PROMIS Fatigue scores were SMT, 22.25; LT, 22.05; and WLC, 23.24. The mean (standard deviation) reduction in PROMIS Fatigue scores was -5.49 (2.53) points for SMT versus -3.24 (2.57) points for LT and -0.06 (1.88) points for WLC (treatment-by-time P = .0008). Higher credibility, expectancy, and preference for SMT than for LT did not account for these results. SMT produced clinically significant relief of CRF. This finding suggests that 6 weeks of a safe, widely accepted manual intervention causes a significant reduction in fatigue, a debilitating sequela for cancer survivors.

MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and PsycINFO were searched from 1990 to June 2008 inclusive. Cancer guidelines and recommendations were searched from 2002 forward and systematic reviews from 2003 to June 2008. Standard systematic review methodology was employed. Eligibility criteria included English studies evaluating breast, colorectal, ovarian, or prostate cancers. Study designs were restricted to systematic review, experimental and diagnostic types. Populations were limited to those unselected for cancer risk. Interventions were limited to collection of cancer FHx; primary and/or secondary prevention interventions for breast, colorectal, ovarian, and prostate cancers. Accuracy of models. Seven eligible studies evaluated systems based on the Gail model, and on the Harvard Cancer Risk Index. No evaluations demonstrated more than modest discriminatory accuracy at an individual level. No evaluations were identified relevant to ovarian or prostate cancer risk. Efficacy of preventive interventions. From 29 eligible systematic reviews, seven found no experimental studies evaluating interventions of interest. Of the remaining 22, none addressed ovarian cancer prevention. The reviews were generally based on limited numbers of randomized or controlled clinical trials. There was no evidence either to support or refute the use of selected chemoprevention interventions, there was some evidence of effectiveness for mammography and fecal occult blood testing. Uptake of intervention. Three studies evaluated the impact of FHx-based risk information on uptake of clinical preventive interventions for breast cancer. The evidence is insufficient to draw conclusions on the effect of FHx-based risk information on change in preventive behavior. Potential harms of FHx taking. One uncontrolled trial evaluated the impact of FHx-based breast cancer risk information on psychological outcomes and found no evidence of significant harm. Our review indicates a very limited evidence base with which to address all four of the research questions: 1) the few evaluations of cancer risk prediction models do not suggest useful individual predictive accuracy; 2) the experimental evidence base for primary and secondary cancer prevention is very limited; 3) there is insufficient evidence to assess the effect of FHx-based risk assessment on preventive behaviors; 4) there is insufficient evidence to assess whether FHx-based personalized risk assessment directly causes adverse outcomes."
Prophylactic antibiotics to prevent surgical site infection after breast cancer surgery.,"Cunningham, Bunn, Handscomb","Journal Article, Meta-Analysis, Review, Systematic Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16625637/,Infection rates for surgical treatment of breast cancer are documented at between three and 15%. Pre and peri-operative antibiotics have been found to be useful in lowering infection rates in other surgical groups. There is no current consensus on prophylactic antibiotic use in breast cancer surgery.,"Surgery has been used as part of breast cancer treatment for centuries; however any surgical procedure has the potential risk of infection. Infection rates for surgical treatment of breast cancer are documented at between three and 15%, higher than average for a clean surgical procedure. Pre and peri-operative antibiotics have been found to be useful in lowering infection rates in other surgical groups, yet there is no current consensus on prophylactic antibiotic use in breast cancer surgery. To determine the effects of prophylactic antibiotics on the incidence of surgical site infection after breast cancer surgery. We searched the Cochrane Wounds and Breast Cancer Groups Specialised Registers, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) issue 1 2006. MEDLINE 2002-2005, EMBASE 1980-2005, NRR issue 1 2005, CINAHL 1982-2004 and SIGLE 1976-2004. Companies and experts in the field were contacted and reference lists were checked. No language restrictions were applied. Randomised controlled trials of pre and peri-operative antibiotics for patients undergoing surgery for breast cancer were included. Primary outcomes were, incidence of breast wound infection and adverse reactions to treatment. Two authors independently examined the title and abstracts of all studies identified by the search strategy, then assessed study quality and extracted data from those that met the inclusion criteria. Six studies met the inclusion criteria. All six evaluated pre-operative antibiotic compared with no antibiotic or placebo. Pooling of the results demonstrated that prophylactic antibiotics significantly reduce the incidence of surgical site infection for patients undergoing breast cancer surgery without reconstruction (pooled RR 0.66, 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.89). No studies presented separate data for patients who underwent reconstructive surgery at the time of removal of the breast tumour. Prophylactic antibiotics reduce the risk of surgical site infection in patients undergoing surgery for breast cancer. The potential morbidity caused by infection, such as delays in wound healing or adjuvant cancer treatments must be balanced against the cost of treatment and potential adverse effects such as drug reactions or increased bacterial resistance. Further studies of patients undergoing immediate breast reconstruction would be useful as studies have identified this group as being at higher risk of infection than those who do not undergo immediate breast reconstruction."

During the past two decades several CP strategies have evolved. The first generation of CP trials tested the efficacy of antioxidants and vitamins including B-carotene, vitamin A, retinol, 13 cis retinoic acid, vitamins E, C and selenium. Although these trials were disappointing, provocative hypotheses were generated for selenium and vitamin E that set the stage for future prostate trials. In the 1990s, the NCI launched a second generation of large CP trials aimed at breast and prostate cancer. One of these trials is the PCPT, testing the efficacy of a 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor-finasteride to prevent prostate cancer in 18,000 men. Although PCPT is still in progress, the NCI recently launched a second large primary prostate CP trial called SELECT, testing the efficacy of selenium and vitamin E in 32,400 men. The Prostate Cancer Progress Report to the Director of NCI in 1998 challenged the research community to design more efficient CP trials for prostate cancer. In response, the NCI has evolved a third generation of CP trials. This involves pharmacologically driven translational science research including agents and their targets, biomarker endpoints, suitable clinical models for testing agents and efficient trial designs employing high risk cohorts and surrogate endpoints. In summary, a dual strategy for CP is being developed which includes public health measures and a medical intervention approach."
"Chemoprevention of breast cancer, proteomic discovery of genistein action in the rat mammary gland.","Rowell, Carpenter, Lamartiniere","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16317154/,Genistein suppresses chemically induced mammary cancer in rats. Gestational or adult-only exposures do not provide protection. An inverse relation exists between cancer susceptibility and mammary gland differentiation. Early prepubertal exposure to genistein enhances cell proliferation.,"Genistein, the primary isoflavone component of soy, consumed in the diet during the prepubertal period only, and the combined prepubertal and adult periods, suppresses chemically induced mammary cancer in rats. Gestational or adult-only exposures do not provide protection. An inverse relation exists between cancer susceptibility and mammary gland differentiation. The current study used proteomic technology to investigate genistein mechanisms of action as related to programming against chemically induced mammary cancer. Rats were injected subcutaneously with 500 microg genistein/g body weight on d 16, 18, and 20 postpartum. At d 21, mammary glands were subjected to 2-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After gel scanning, image analysis, and MS, 6 proteins were determined to be differentially regulated and identified. One protein, GTP-cyclohydrolase 1 (GTP-CH1), was confirmed as being significantly upregulated at d 21 by immunoblot analysis. Investigation of downstream signaling from GTP-CH1 showed that tyrosine hydroxylase was upregulated and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) was downregulated in the mammary glands of 50-d-old rats treated with genistein in the prepubertal period. This and previous work suggest that early prepubertal exposure to genistein enhances cell proliferation by upregulating GTP-CH1 and the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-signaling pathway, and hence cell differentiation and gland maturation. This unique developmental maturation leads to a new biochemical blueprint, whereby the cells have reduced EGF signaling and VEGFR2, which renders the mature mammary gland less proliferative and less susceptible to cancer. This study demonstrated the usefulness of proteomics for the discovery of novel pathways that may be involved in cancer prevention."
Acceptability of Localized Cancer Risk Reduction Interventions Among Individuals at Average or High Risk for Cancer.,"Samimi, Heckman-Stoddard, Kay, Bloodgood, Coa, Robinson, Tennant, Ford, Szabo, Minasian","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30824471/,"Locally delivered chemopreventive agents, where direct action on the primary organ may limit systemic toxicity, are emerging as an option for high-risk individuals. Clinical trials that collect additional patient-centered data including side effects and how these interventions fit into an individual's lifestyle are imperative.","Individuals at high risk for cancer, including those already diagnosed with premalignant lesions, can potentially benefit from chemopreventive interventions to reduce cancer risk. However, uptake and acceptability have been hindered due to the risk of systemic toxicity and other adverse effects. Locally delivered chemopreventive agents, where direct action on the primary organ may limit systemic toxicity, are emerging as an option for high-risk individuals. While a number of clinical trials support the development of chemopreventive agents, it is crucial to understand the factors and barriers that influence their acceptability and use. We conducted 36 focus groups with 198 individuals at average and high risk of breast/ovarian, gynecologic, and head/neck/oral and lung cancers to examine the perceptions and acceptability of chemopreventive agents. Participants' willingness to use chemopreventive agents was influenced by several factors, including perceived risk of cancer, skepticism around prevention, previous knowledge of chemopreventive agents, support from trusted sources of health information, participation in other cancer-related risk-reduction activities, previous experience with similar modalities, cost, regimen, side effects, and perceived effectiveness of the preventive intervention. Our findings indicate that individuals may be more receptive to locally delivered chemopreventive agents if they perceive themselves to be at high risk for cancer and are given the necessary information regarding regimen and side effects to make an informed decision. Clinical trials that collect additional patient-centered data including side effects and how these interventions fit into an individual's lifestyle are imperative to improve uptake of chemopreventive agents."
Chemoprevention activity of dipyridamole in the MMTV-PyMT transgenic mouse model of breast cancer.,"Wang, Schwab, Fan, Seagroves, Buolamwini","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23447563/,Dipyridamole (DPM) is widely used to prevent strokes and vascular thrombosis.

Combination therapy of DPM and antimetabolites has shown synergistic anticancer activity. This study investigated the chemopreventive effects of DPM in the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter-driven polyoma middle T oncoprotein metastatic breast cancer model. We also investigated the effects of DPM on gene and miRNA expression. Chemopreventive activity was assessed by comparing the time to onset of palpable lesions, primary tumor growth kinetics, and the number of lung metastases in transgenic mice treated with DPM or vehicle. Gene expression and miRNA expression profiles of mammary tumor tissues were then analyzed using the Affymetrix GeneChip or miRNA 2.0 arrays. Real-time quantitative PCR was used to confirm changes in gene expression. Treatment with DPM beginning at the age of 4 weeks delayed the onset of palpable lesions, delayed tumor progression, and suppressed lung metastasis. Microarray gene expression analysis identified 253 genes differentially expressed between DPM-treated and control mammary tumors. miRNA expression analysis revealed that 53 miRNAs were altered by DPM treatment. The results indicate that DPM has chemoprevention activity against breast cancer tumorigenesis and metastasis in mice. The array analyses provide insights into potential mechanisms of DPM's chemopreventive effects, involving upregulation of several genes and miRNAs known to suppress cancer growth and/or metastasis and downregulation of genes known to promote cancer. Some of these genes have not been previously studied in breast cancer and may serve as novel molecular targets for breast cancer chemoprevention."
Current issues in prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1.,Coovadia,"Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19532071/,A large gap in prevention of mother-to-child-transmission [MTCT] is being increasingly bridged. Breastfeeding transmission affects the majority of HIV-infected pregnant women and children in the world. Prevention of unwanted pregnancies in all women living in high HIV prevalence regions will probably reduce the risk. Health infrastructure improvement in developing countries is central to the application of research findings.,"To review new evidence in prevention of mother-to-child-transmission of HIV-1, which establishes, in principle, the feasibility of greatly improved effectiveness in developing countries. This review presents evidence that demonstrates that a large gap in prevention of mother-to-child-transmission [MTCT] is being increasingly bridged. Recent studies have addressed issues on postnatal transmission of HIV-1 through breastfeeding. Breastfeeding transmission affects the majority of HIV-infected pregnant women and children in the world and who live in Africa and are often poor. Prevention of unwanted pregnancies in all women living in high HIV prevalence regions will probably reduce the risk of HIV-positive pregnancies. These studies demonstrate the success of the following three types of interventions:primary prevention of HIV-1 in women;prophylaxis with antiretroviral drugs in breastfeeding infants;prophylaxis with antiretroviral drugs for lactating mothers.It is also clear that key barriers to implementing these findings in developing countries are weak and ineffectual health systems. Therefore, identifying needs for improving health service delivery are critical; an example of the synergy between prevention and treatment through integrated services is given. Recent data on primary prevention of HIV-1 in women of child-bearing age, and use of antiretrovirals in breastfeeding infants and lactating mothers, report successful interventions for the prevention of breastfeeding transmission of HIV-1. Health infrastructure improvement in developing countries is central to the application of research findings to implementation of MTCT programmes."
The advancement of cancer chemoprevention by revision of clinical trial strategies.,Sharma,"Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11887091/,The focus of oncological drug development has shifted from cytotoxic chemotherapy to rationally designed agents that target specific molecules associated with malignant cells or their environment. Tamoxifen and celecoxib have been licensed in the USA for the chemoprevention of breast and colorectal cancers respectively.,"After a quarter of a century of rapid advances in cancer research, the focus of oncological drug development has shifted from cytotoxic chemotherapy to rationally designed agents that target specific molecules associated with malignant cells or their environment. As a consequence of greater public awareness of health related issues and population screening, the detection of early cancer or premalignant lesions has demonstrated the potential that exists for targeting the same molecules during carcinogenesis. One method of such intervention is chemoprevention, the inhibition, retardation or reversal of carcinogenic processes by chemical means. Tamoxifen and celecoxib have been licensed in the USA for the chemoprevention of breast and colorectal cancers respectively in certain well-defined ""at risk"" individuals. Unfortunately, many large-scale cancer chemoprevention trials have yielded negative results, and a few may even have caused harm to healthy individuals considered at risk of developing cancer. In this article, the importance of not putting the cart before the horse is argued. In particular, two factors in chemopreventive agent development will be emphasised: phase I/II studies in patients with cancer or patients at risk of second primary tumors and the validation and incorporation of biomarkers of carcinogenesis from the earliest phases of clinical development. This structured approach currently emerging is providing pharmacological and mechanistic data on novel agents which will prove essential in the planning of larger-scale commitments."
Symptoms and QOL as Predictors of Chemoprevention Adherence in NRG Oncology/NSABP Trial P-1.,"Land, Walcott, Liu, Wickerham, Costantino, Ganz","Clinical Trial, Phase III, Journal Article, Multicenter Study, Randomized Controlled Trial, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26615179/,Tamoxifen provides a 50% reduction in the incidence of breast cancer among high-risk women.

Using the prospective double-blind National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project P-1 study, we evaluated whether participant-reported outcomes were associated with drug adherence and whether baseline behavioral risk factors modified those associations. P-1 participants were randomly assigned to placebo vs tamoxifen (20mg/day). Mixed effects logistic regression was used to evaluate whether baseline or three-month SF-36 quality of life (QOL) mental and physical component summaries (MCS, PCS), and participant-reported symptoms (gynecologic, vasomotor, sexual, and other) predicted 12-month drug adherence (76-100% of assigned medication). The evaluation accounted for age, treatment, estimated breast cancer risk, education, baseline smoking, alcohol consumption, and obesity. All statistical tests were two-sided. Participants enrolled at least three years before trial unblinding and without medically indicated discontinuation before 12 months were eligible for the present analyses (n = 10 576). At 12 months, 84.3% were adherent. Statistically significant predictors of adherence were: three-month MCS (odds ratio [OR] = 1.15 per 10 points, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.06 to 1.25); three-month gynecologic symptoms among moderate alcohol drinkers (OR = .79, 95% CI = 0.72 to 0.88); baseline vasomotor symptoms among participants assigned tamoxifen (OR = .88, 95% CI = 0.80 to 0.97); and three-month sexual symptoms among younger participants (OR = .89 at age 41 years, 95% CI = 0.80 to 0.99). The strongest association was with three-month other symptoms (OR = .77, 95% CI = 0.63 to 0.93). PCS was not associated with adherence. Symptom and QOL associations were not modified by smoking or obesity. Promoting QOL and managing symptoms early in therapy may be important strategies to improve adherence."

Most are caused by mutations in tumor suppressor genes. Patients with HCS have a higher than normal risk of a second malignancy.","The origin, characteristics, and lifetime risk for the following five types of hereditary cancer (HCS) syndromes are briefly described in this review: hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) syndrome, hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) syndrome, and medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). Most are caused by mutations in tumor suppressor genes. In HCS, a single copy of the mutated tumor suppressor gene is inherited, and mutation of the second wild type allele of the gene is required for tumorigenesis. Patients with HCS have a higher than normal risk of a second malignancy. Management strategies to address increased cancer risk in HCS include genetic counseling and testing, targeted surveillance, chemoprevention, and prophylactic surgery. Genetic testing for high-risk family members is strongly recommended. Available data indicate surgical prophylaxis is more successful than surveillance in reducing cancer risk in carriers of BRCA, CDH1, APC, and RET mutation."

A decision analysis was performed using a hypothetical cohort of women that included subgroups with atypical hyperplasia, Gail risk greater than 5, lobular carcinoma-in-situ, or two or more first-degree relatives with breast cancer. Data sources were the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial, the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End-Results program, time trade-off preference ratings, the Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound, and the United States Health Care Financing Administration. Our model predicted that tamoxifen would prolong the average survival of cohort members initiating use at ages 35, 50, and 60 years by 70, 42, and 27 days, respectively. It would prolong survival even more for those in the higher-risk groups, especially those with atypical hyperplasia (202, 89, and 45 days). Tamoxifen use was also projected to extend quality-adjusted survival by 158, 80, and 50 days in the atypical hyperplasia group. For younger women in the highest risk groups, chemoprevention with tamoxifen was estimated to have cost savings or be cost-effective, both with and without quality adjustments. Chemoprevention with tamoxifen may be particularly beneficial to women with atypical hyperplasia, 5-year Gail model risk greater than 5%, lobular carcinoma-in-situ, or two or more first-degree relatives with breast cancer. The benefits may be greater if tamoxifen is initiated before age 50 years rather than after and if the breast cancer risk reduction conferred by tamoxifen lasts longer than 5 years. For women with a very high risk of invasive breast cancer, chemoprevention with tamoxifen seems to be cost-effective."

Assessing women's risk for the development of breast cancer is important in providing primary and secondary preventive strategies.,"The purpose of this study was to describe nurse practitioners' (NPs') knowledge, use, and perceived comfort level in providing breast cancer risk assessment to women in clinical settings. This descriptive study was part of a needs assessment to determine if education and training programs on breast cancer risk assessment are warranted for NPs. A convenience sample of 147 NPs completed surveys to assess their knowledge of breast cancer risk assessment and use of empiric breast cancer risk assessment tools, and to evaluate their perceived comfort level in assessing women's risk for developing breast cancer. Assessing women's risk for the development of breast cancer is important in providing primary and secondary preventive strategies such as chemoprevention, lifestyle changes, and enhanced surveillance that may reduce a woman's risk for developing the disease. Although 51.4% of NPs reported providing breast cancer risk assessment, few (37%) reported use of family history or the Gail model (6%) to determine their patients' breast cancer risk. NPs' knowledge of breast cancer risk assessment and use of empiric risk assessment models were low. The majority (71%) of NPs felt uncomfortable or a low level of comfort in conducting breast cancer risk assessment. Excluding skin cancer, breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer and second leading cause of cancer death among women in the United States. Breast cancer risk assessment is important in identifying women who may be at high risk for developing the disease. At the front line in health care, NPs can play a vital role in assessing women's risk for breast cancer. These findings suggest that education and training may be warranted to enhance knowledge and use of empiric risk models to increase the comfort level of NPs in conducting breast cancer risk assessment to their patients."
Risk biomarkers and current strategies for cancer chemoprevention.,"Kelloff, Boone, Crowell, Nayfield, Hawk, Malone, Steele, Lubet, Sigman","Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9027592/,"For chemoprevention, the important cancer risk factors are those that can be measured quantitatively. These factors, called risk biomarkers, can be used to identify cohorts. Risk biomarkers fit into categories based on those previously defined by Hulka.","Quantifiable, well-characterized cancer risk factors demonstrate the need for chemoprevention and define cohorts for chemopreventive intervention. For chemoprevention, the important cancer risk factors are those that can be measured quantitatively in the subject at risk. These factors, called risk biomarkers, can be used to identify cohorts for chemoprevention. Those modulated by chemopreventive agents may also be used as endpoints in chemoprevention studies. Generally, the risk biomarkers fit into categories based on those previously defined by Hulka: 1) carcinogen exposure, 2) carcinogen exposure/effect, 3) genetic predisposition, 4) intermediate biomarkers of cancer, and 5) previous cancers. Besides their use in characterizing cohorts for chemoprevention trials, some risk biomarkers can be modulated by chemopreventive agents. These biomarkers may be suitable surrogate endpoints for cancer incidence in chemoprevention intervention trials. The criteria for risk biomarkers defining cohorts and serving as endpoints are the same, except that those defining cohorts are not necessarily modulated by chemopreventive agents. A primary criterion is that the biomarkers fit expected biological mechanisms of early carcinogenesis-i.e., differential expression in normal and high-risk tissue, on or closely linked to the causal pathway for the cancer, and short latency compared with cancer. They must occur in sufficient number to allow their biological and statistical evaluation. Further, the biomarkers should be assayed reliably and quantitatively, measured easily, and correlated to cancer incidence. Particularly important for cancer risk screening in normal subjects is the ability to use noninvasive techniques that are highly specific, sensitive, and quantitative. Since carcinogenesis is a multipath process, single biomarkers are difficult to correlate to cancer, as they may appear on only one or a few of the many possible causal pathways. As shown in colorectal carcinogenesis, the risks associated with the presence of biomarkers may be additive or synergistic. That is, the accumulation of genetic lesions is the more important determinant of colorectal cancer compared with the presence of any single lesion. Thus, batteries of biomarker abnormalities, particularly those representing the range of carcinogenesis pathways, may prove more useful than single biomarkers both in characterizing cohorts at risk and defining modulatable risks. Risk biomarkers are already being integrated into many chemoprevention intervention trials. One example is the phase II trial of oltipraz inhibition of carcinogen-DNA adducts in a Chinese population exposed to aflatoxin B1. Also, urine samples from subjects in this trial will be screened for the effect of oltipraz on urinary mutagens. A second example is a chemoprevention protocol developed for patients at high risk for breast cancer; the cohort is defined both by hereditary risk and the presence of biomarker abnormalities. Modulation of the biomarker abnormalities is a proposed endpoint. Also, dysplastic lesions, such as prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, oral leukoplakia and colorectal adenomas, have been used to define high-risk cohorts and as potential modulatable surrogate endpoints in chemoprevention trials."

Germline mutations in the <i>BRCA1</i> and <i>BRCA2</i> genes are significant risk factors for specific subtypes of breast cancer. <i>BRCA1</i> mutations are associated with basal-like breast cancers, whereas <i>BRCA2</i> mutations are associated with luminal-like disease. There are currently few chemoprevention strategies available for <i>BRCA1</i>/<i>2</i> mutation carriers, and irreversible prophylactic mastectomy is the primary option. Designing chemo-preventive strategies requires an in-depth understanding of the physiological processes underlying tumor initiation. Here, we employ spatial transcriptomics to investigate defects in mammary epithelial cell differentiation accompanied by distinct microenvironmental alterations in preneoplastic breast tissues from <i>BRCA1</i>/<i>2</i> mutation carriers and normal breast tissues from non-carrier controls. We uncovered spatially defined receptor-ligand interactions in these tissues for the investigation of autocrine and paracrine signaling. We discovered that β1-integrin-mediated autocrine signaling in <i>BRCA2</i>-deficient mammary epithelial cells differs from <i>BRCA1</i>-deficient mammary epithelial cells. In addition, we found that the epithelial-to-stromal paracrine signaling in the breast tissues of <i>BRCA1</i>/<i>2</i> mutation carriers is greater than in control tissues. More integrin-ligand pairs were differentially correlated in <i>BRCA1</i>/<i>2</i>-mutant breast tissues than non-carrier breast tissues with more integrin receptor-expressing stromal cells. These results reveal alterations in the communication between mammary epithelial cells and the microenvironment in <i>BRCA1</i> and <i>BRCA2</i> mutation carriers, laying the foundation for designing innovative breast cancer chemo-prevention strategies for high-risk patients."

There are more than 4,000 different retinoids which have a wide spectrum of preclinical activities, structures, pharmacological profiles, tissue distributions, receptor specificities, and toxicities. A number of retinoids have significant activity in many in vivo experimental systems including skin, bladder, lung, breast and oral carcinogenesis. In clinical trials, several retinoids have achieved significant activity in the reversal of head and neck, skin, and cervical premalignancy, and in the prevention of second primary tumors associated with head and neck, skin, and non-small cell lung cancer. Since 1984, our group has conducted a series of clinical trials to explore the chemopreventive potential of 13-cis-retinoic acid (13cRA) in the aerodigestive tract. We have conducted two consecutive randomized studies in subjects with premalignant lesions of the oral cavity. These studies showed that high-dose 13cRA alone can achieve significant short-term reversal of oral premalignancy, and that high-dose followed by low-dose 13cRA can maintain suppression of oral carcinogenesis. Three other randomized trials have confirmed significant retinoid activity in this human carcinogenic system. We also developed a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of adjuvant high-dose 13cRA in patients with head and neck cancer. Second primary tumor development was significantly decreased in the 13cRA group, but 13cRA had no impact on primary disease recurrence or survival. This presentation will update the current status of clinical trials and correlative laboratory studies of potential intermediate endpoint biomarkers in retinoid chemoprevention of aerodigestive tract carcinogenesis."

We argue for careful consideration to be given to the in vitro experimental conditions under which dietary phyllochemicals are investigated.,"There is a large body of evidence that the consumption of fruit and vegetables can decrease the risk of cancer. However, the link between diet and health is extremely complex. Some dietary phytochemicals seem to offer protection in an exposure-related manner and many molecular targets and signaling pathways affected by phytochemicals have been discovered. Although in vitro studies have contributed significantly to our understanding, quite a number use concentrations orders of magnitude greater than those achievable in humans or toxic to normal tissues (exemplified by toxic concentrations of indole-3-carbinol, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, curcumin, and genistein for breast cells). Such studies may produce results that are physiologically irrelevant, thus hindering predictions of efficacy. Here, we argue for careful consideration to be given to the in vitro experimental conditions under which dietary phytochemicals are investigated. Design features, such as the use of appropriate nontoxic concentrations, extended treatment times, three-dimensional cultures, primary tumor cultures, and comparison of susceptibility of various cancer subtypes, should improve our understanding of their molecular targets. This in turn would facilitate predictions as to their potential usefulness in the clinic."
Antibiotic prophylaxis in clean surgery: breast surgery and hernia repair.,"D'Amico, Parimbelli, Ruffolo","Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11936352/,Use of prophylactic antibiotics in clean surgery is still controversial. The presence of an infected breast wound delays the beginning of postoperative anticancer therapy. A single-dose of cephalosporin at the induction of anesthesia may be prudent.,"Use of prophylactic antibiotics in clean surgery is still controversial. We reviewed the literature of the last 10 years to identify the best way to approach clean surgery. The question is more important for patients undergoing breast surgery. The presence of an infected breast wound delays the beginning of postoperative adjuvant anticancer therapy: there is good evidence to suggest that delayed adjuvant therapy compromises the outcome for patients in terms of both local control and survival. There are several clinical trials that have addressed the efficacy of prophylactic antibiotics for patients undergoing breast surgery and hernia repair. Platt et al assessed the efficacy of preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis in a clinical trial of 1218 patients undergoing clean surgery with an absolute reduction rate of 39% in wound infections. Gupta et al reported no influence on the incidence of infective complications by antibiotic prophylaxis in 357 patients undergoing elective breast surgery. Like breast surgery, use of prophylaxis in hernia repair is not clear: a prospective, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study of 619 patients assessed no benefit of antibiotic prophylaxis. On the other hand Lewis et al reported a 75% reduction of infections in low-risk patients when a single dose of cefotaxime was used in clean operations. A particularly interesting point is the use of prosthetic mesh in hernia repair and primary reconstructive surgery in breast surgery. Amland et al reported a significant reduction of the incidence of wound infections in a group of patients undergoing reconstructive breast surgery, receiving azithromycin vs placebo (5% vs 20%). In hernia repair we stress the need to prevent wound infections: currently Liechtestein's technique is widely performed all over the world. Mesh infection is an unpleasant event that requires prosthesis removal. The lack of conclusive studies about antibiotic prophylaxis in clean surgery suggests that a single-dose of cephalosporin at the induction of anesthesia may be prudent. This procedure is certainly inexpensive and safe and, more importantly, probably does not have an impact on antibiotic resistance."
Women's decisions regarding tamoxifen for breast cancer prevention: responses to a tailored decision aid.,"Fagerlin, Zikmund-Fisher, Nair, Derry, McClure, Greene, Stark, Hensley Alford, Lantz, Hayes, Wiese, Claud Zweig, Pitsch, Jankovic, Ubel","Clinical Trial, Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19908143/,Few women with increased breast cancer risk have elected to use tamoxifen for chemoprevention.

To date, few women with increased breast cancer risk have elected to use tamoxifen for chemoprevention. The objective of the study was to determine women's knowledge of and attitudes toward tamoxifen following exposure to a tailored decision aid (DA). A total of 632 women with a 5-year risk of breast cancer > or = 1.66% (Mean = 2.56, range = 1.7-17.3) were recruited from two healthcare organizations. Participants viewed an online DA that informed them about their 5-year risk of breast cancer and presented individually tailored content depicting the risks/benefits of tamoxifen prophylaxis. Outcome measures included behavioral intentions (to seek additional information about tamoxifen, to talk to a physician about tamoxifen, and to take tamoxifen); knowledge; and perceived risks and benefits of tamoxifen. After viewing the DA, 29% of participants said they intended to seek more information or talk to their doctor about tamoxifen, and only 6% believed they would take tamoxifen. Knowledge was considerable, with 63% of women answering at least 5 of 6 knowledge questions correctly. Participants were concerned about the risks of tamoxifen, and many believed that the benefits of tamoxifen did not outweigh the risks. This study is the largest to date to test women's preferences for taking tamoxifen and one of the largest to have tested the impact of a tailored DA. After viewing the DA, women demonstrated good understanding of tamoxifen's risks and benefits, but most were not interested in taking tamoxifen for breast cancer chemoprevention."
RAZOR: A Phase II Open Randomized Trial of Screening Plus Goserelin and Raloxifene Versus Screening Alone in Premenopausal Women at Increased Risk of Breast Cancer.,"Howell, Ashcroft, Fallowfield, Eccles, Eeles, Ward, Brentnall, Dowsett, Cuzick, Greenhalgh, Boggis, Motion, Sergeant, Adams, Evans","Clinical Trial, Phase II, Journal Article, Randomized Controlled Trial, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29097444/,"Ovarian suppression in premenopausal women is known to reduce breast cancer risk.

This study aimed to assess uptake and compliance with ovarian suppression using the luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) analogue, goserelin, with add-back raloxifene, as a potential regimen for breast cancer prevention.<b>Methods:</b> Women at ≥30% lifetime risk breast cancer were approached and randomized to mammographic screening alone (C-Control) or screening in addition to monthly subcutaneous injections of 3.6 mg goserelin and continuous 60 mg raloxifene daily orally (T-Treated) for 2 years. The primary endpoint was therapy adherence. Secondary endpoints were toxicity/quality of life, change in bone density, and mammographic density.<b>Results:</b> A total of 75/950 (7.9%) women approached agreed to randomization. In the T-arm, 20 of 38 (52%) of women completed the 2-year period of study compared with the C-arm (27/37, 73.0%). Dropouts were related to toxicity but also the wish to have established risk-reducing procedures and proven chemoprevention. As relatively few women completed the study, data are limited, but those in the T-arm reported significant increases in toxicity and sexual problems, no change in anxiety, and less cancer worry. Lumbar spine bone density declined by 7.0% and visually assessed mammographic density by 4.7% over the 2-year treatment period.<b>Conclusions:</b> Uptake is somewhat lower than comparable studies with tamoxifen for prevention with higher dropout rates. Raloxifene may preserve bone density, but reduction in mammographic density reversed after treatment was completed.<b>Impact:</b> This study indicates that breast cancer risk reduction may be possible using LHRH agonists, but reducing toxicity and preventing bone changes would make this a more attractive option. <i>Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 27(1); 58-66. ©2017 AACR</i>."
"Improvements in tumor targeting, survivorship, and chemoprevention pioneered by tamoxifen. A personal perspective.","Jordan, Knudson","Comment, Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16773843/,"Twenty years ago, antiestrogen therapy with tamoxifen played only a secondary role in breast cancer care. The new approach of using long-term antihormone therapy to control early-stage breast cancer growth would revolutionize cancer care, authors say.","Twenty years ago, antiestrogen therapy with tamoxifen played only a secondary role in breast cancer care. All hopes to cure metastatic breast cancer were still pinned on either the discovery of new cytotoxic drugs or a dose-dense combination of available cytotoxic drugs with bone marrow transplantation. A similar strategy with combination chemotherapy was employed as an adjuvant for primary breast cancer. Simply stated, the goal was to kill the cancer with nonspecific cytotoxic drugs while keeping the patient alive with supportive care. However, medical research does not travel in straight lines, and an alternative approach emerged to solve the problem of controlling tumor growth with minimal side effects: targeted therapy. The approach of using long-term antihormone therapy to control early-stage breast cancer growth would revolutionize cancer care by targeting the tumor estrogen receptor (ER). The success of the strategy would contribute to a decrease in the national mortality figures for breast cancer. More importantly, translational research that targeted the tumor ER with a range of new antiestrogenic drugs would presage the current fashion of blocking survival pathways for the tumor by developing novel targeted treatments. But a surprise was in store when the pharmacology of ""antiestrogens"" was studied in detail: The nonsteroidal ""antiestrogens"" are selective ER modulators--ie, they are antiestrogens in the breast, estrogens in the bone--and they lower circulating cholesterol levels. This knowledge would establish a practical approach to breast cancer chemoprevention for women at high risk (tamoxifen) and low risk (raloxifene)."

Therefore we did a trial in hysterectomised women of tamoxifen as a chemopreventive. In October, 1992, we started a double-blind placebo-controlled, randomised trial of tamoxifen in women (mainly in Italy) who did not have breast cancer and who had had a hysterectomy. Women were randomised to receive tamoxifen 20 mg per day or placebo, both orally for 5 years. The original plan was to follow the intervention phase by 5 years' follow-up. In June, 1997, the trialists and the data-monitoring committee decided to end recruitment primarily because of the number of women dropping out of the study. Recruitment ended on July 11, 1997, and the study will continue as planned. The primary endpoints are the occurrence of and deaths from breast cancer. This preliminary interim analysis is based on intention-to-treat. 5408 women were randomised; participating women have a median follow-up of 46 months for major endpoints. 41 cases of breast cancer occurred so far; there have been no deaths from breast cancer. There is no difference in breast-cancer frequency between the placebo (22 cases) and tamoxifen (19) arms. There is a statistically significant reduction of breast cancer among women receiving tamoxifen who also used hormone-replacement therapy during the trial: among 390 women on such therapy and allocated to placebo, we found eight cases of breast cancer compared with one case among 362 women allocated to tamoxifen. Compared with the placebo group, there was a significantly increased risk of vascular events and hypertriglyceridaemia among women on tamoxifen. Although this preliminary analysis has low power, in this cohort of women at low-to-normal risk of breast cancer, the postulated protective effects of tamoxifen are not yet apparent. Women using hormone-replacement therapy appear to have benefited from use of tamoxifen. There were no deaths from breast cancer recorded in women in the study. It is essential to continue follow-up to quantify the long-term risks and benefits of tamoxifen therapy."
Second field tumors: a new opportunity for cancer prevention?,"Braakhuis, Brakenhoff, Leemans","Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16079316/,"Most head and neck squamous cell carcinomas develop within a contiguous field of preneoplastic cells. A subclone in a field gives rise to an invasive carcinoma. When a field remains after resection of the tumor, the risk for another carcinoma, designated as a second field tumor, is considerably greater.","Recent molecular genetic studies provide evidence that the majority of, if not all, head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) develop within a contiguous field of preneoplastic cells. Cells of a field show genetic alterations associated with the process of carcinogenesis. A subclone in a field gives rise to an invasive carcinoma. An important implication of this knowledge is that, after surgery of the initial carcinoma, part of the field may remain in the patient. A field with preneoplastic cells that share genetic alterations with cells of the excised tumor has been detected in the resection margins of at least 25% of patients, indicating that this frequently occurs. Fields can be much larger than the actual carcinoma, sometimes having a diameter >7 cm. When a field remains after resection of the tumor, the risk for another carcinoma, designated as a second field tumor (SFT), is considerably greater. It is important to realize that an SFT develops from preneoplastic cells clonally related to the initial tumor. In this respect, it should be discriminated from a recurrent carcinoma that has developed from minimal residual cancer that was left behind and from a second primary tumor that independently develops from the initial carcinoma. Patients at risk for SFTs belong to a unique patient group for whom intense surveillance is indicated and chemoprevention is an attractive option. The priorities are to identify the patients in whom a remaining field will progress to cancer and to find the genes involved. With this knowledge, highly efficient clinical prevention trials, including those using the local application of therapeutic agents, can be designed. It is important to note that SFTs also may occur after treatment of various other cancers, including those of the bladder, skin, esophagus, lung, cervix, breast, and colon."

Here, we describe a functional product based on a combination of compounds, which can be used as an adjuvant therapy and has well-known mechanisms for inhibiting cancer metastases, improving anti-cancer treatment, and enhancing immunity and antioxidant capacity. Our designed combination, named MVBL, consists of four inexpensive compounds: L-selenium-methylselenocysteine (MSC), D-‍α‍-tocopheryl succinic acid (VES), β‍-carotene (β‍-Ca), and L-lysine (Lys). The effects of MVBL on cell viability, cell cycle, cell apoptosis, cell migration, cell invasion, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and paclitaxel (PTX)-combined treatment were studied in vitro. The inhibition of tumor metastasis, antioxidation, and immune enhancement capacity of MVBL were determined in vivo. MVBL exhibited higher toxicity to tumor cells than to normal cells. It did not significantly affect the cell cycle of cancer cells, but increased their apoptosis. Wound healing, adhesion, and transwell assays showed that MVBL significantly inhibited tumor cell migration, adhesion, and invasion. MVBL sensitized MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells to PTX, indicating that it can be used as an adjuvant to enhance the therapeutic effect of chemotherapy drugs. In mice, experimental data showed that MVBL inhibited tumor metastasis, prolonged their survival time, and enhanced their antioxidant capacity and immune function. This study revealed the roles of MVBL in improving immunity and antioxidation, preventing tumor growth, and inhibiting metastasis in vitro and in vivo. MVBL may be used as an adjuvant drug in cancer therapy for improving the survival and quality of life of cancer patients."

Of particular importance has been the search for intermediate endpoints which might provide valid indications of cancer prevention effectiveness. Intermediate endpoints, however, suffer the limitations of the extrapolation required to the prevention of cancer per se. More direct evidence of chemoprevention effectiveness may come from trials that use actual reduction of cancer incidence as the primary endpoint.

Breast cancer 2004: Progress and promise on the clinical front.,Gralow,Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17645981/,Carcinoma of the breast is the most common cancer in u.s. women. Advancing age and female sex are the two greatest risk factors for the development of breast cancer. Inherited mutations account for approximately 5-10% of all breast cancer cases. Breast mri as a tool for screening high risk women is a particularly exciting new tool.,"Carcinoma of the breast is the most common cancer in u.s. women (excluding skin cancer), and the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality. In 2004, it is estimated that 215,000 u.s. women will develop invasive breast cancer, and 40,000 women will die of the disease. Advancing age and female sex are the two greatest risk factors for the development of breast cancer, although family history, reproductive and hormonal history, lifestyle and environmental factors all contribute to risk. Models are available to help estimate risk of developing breast cancer in individual patients. Inherited mutations, specifically in the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2, account for approximately 5-10% of all breast cancer cases. Significant advances have recently been made in both the primary prevention of breast cancer (including chemoprevention), and secondary prevention (early detection through breast imaging). Breast mri as a tool for screening high risk women is a particularly exciting new tool. When breast cancer is diagnosed, optimal treatment involves a multidisciplinary approach, including surgery, radiation therapy, and systemic therapies. In the field of breast surgery, breast conservation and sentinel lymph node biopsy techniques have allowed substantially decreased surgery in appropriated selected patients with corresponding decreases in complication rates and long-term sequelae. Radiation oncologists are comparing partial breast irradiation versus conventional whole breast radiation in an attempt to minimize toxicity and treatment time, and maximize efficacy. The field of breast medical oncology has evolved at a rapid pace in the past decade, with numerous new hormonal agents, chemotherapeutic agents, and biologically targeted therapies in clinical use and under investigation. The addition of 'adjuvant' systemic therapy to the treatment of early stage breast cancer patients has dramatically reduced relapse and death rates. Unfortunately, metastatic recurrence still occurs. Once the cancer has spread beyond the breast and locoregional nodal areas it is felt to be incurable, although still treatable. A better understanding of breast cancer biology has led to the development of a host of new biologically targeted agents, many of which hold substantial promise for improving quality of life and survival rates in metastatic breast cancer patients."

Koenimbin-induced cell viability was evaluated using the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. Nuclear condensation, cell permeability, mitochondrial membrane potential, and cytochrome c release were observed using high-content screening. Cell cycle arrest was examined using flow cytometry, while human apoptosis proteome profiler assays were used to investigate the mechanism of apoptosis. Protein expression levels of Bax, Bcl2, and heat shock protein 70 were confirmed using Western blotting. Caspase-7, caspase-8, and caspase-9 levels were measured, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activity was assessed using a high-content screening assay. Aldefluor™ and mammosphere formation assays were used to evaluate the effect of koenimbin on MCF7 breast cancer stem cells in vitro. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was investigated using Western blotting. Koenimbin-induced apoptosis in MCF7 cells was mediated by cell death-transducing signals regulating the mitochondrial membrane potential by downregulating Bcl2 and upregulating Bax, due to cytochrome c release from the mitochondria to the cytosol. Koenimbin induced significant (P<0.05) sub-G0 phase arrest in breast cancer cells. Cytochrome c release triggered caspase-9 activation, which then activated caspase-7, leading to apoptotic changes. This form of apoptosis is closely associated with the intrinsic pathway and inhibition of NF-κB translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Koenimbin significantly (P<0.05) decreased the aldehyde dehydrogenase-positive cell population in MCF7 cancer stem cells and significantly (P<0.01) decreased the size and number of MCF7 cancer stem cells in primary, secondary, and tertiary mammospheres in vitro. Koenimbin also significantly (P<0.05) downregulated the Wnt/β-catenin self-renewal pathway. Koenimbin has potential for future chemoprevention studies, and may lead to the discovery of further cancer management strategies by reducing cancer resistance and recurrence and improving patient survival."

Most of its biological effects are exerted via its nuclear receptor which acts as a transcriptional regulator.","There is growing evidence that 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1α,25(OH)2D3) plays a role in breast cancer prevention and survival. It elicits a variety of antitumor activities like controlling cellular differentiation, proliferation and angiogenesis. Most of its biological effects are exerted via its nuclear receptor which acts as a transcriptional regulator. Here, we carried out a genome-wide investigation of the primary transcriptional targets of 1α,25(OH)2D3 in breast epithelial cancer cells using RNA-Seq technology. We identified early transcriptional targets of 1α,25(OH)2D3 involved in adhesion, growth regulation, angiogenesis, actin cytoskeleton regulation, hexose transport, inflammation and immunomodulation, apoptosis, endocytosis and signaling. Furthermore, we found several transcription factors to be regulated by 1α,25(OH)2D3 that subsequently amplify and diversify the transcriptional output driven by 1α,25(OH)2D3 leading finally to a growth arrest of the cells. Moreover, we could show that 1α,25(OH)2D3 elevates the trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 at several target gene promoters. Our present transcriptomic analysis of differential expression after 1α,25(OH)2D3 treatment provides a resource of primary 1α,25(OH)2D3 targets that might drive the antiproliferative action in breast cancer epithelial cells."
Solid tumours--chemoprevention with retinoids.,Man,"Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7934176/,There is a clear change in the treatment strategies for solid tumours towards the treatment of early rather than advanced disease. Retinoids represent a potentially useful class of drugs in chemoprevention. Different retinoids may have different spectra of antitumour activity.,"There is a clear change in the treatment strategies for solid tumours towards the treatment of early rather than advanced disease. Retinoids represent a potentially useful class of drugs in chemoprevention. Preclinical data and clinical experience suggests that different retinoids may have different spectra of antitumour activity and synergistic interactions between retinoids and cytokines have also been reported. 13-cis retinoic acid has shown some promising activity in preventing the onset of second primary tumours in head and neck cancer and fenretinide is being tested in the prevention of second primary breast cancers. An understanding fo the role of the different retinoid receptors could lead to the design of compounds with a better therapeutic index. Despite these early indications that retinoids could be useful in this area, the development of such drugs is far from easy. Appropriate study designs for screening differentiating agents in the clinic, and the relevance of preclinical models of chemoprevention are challenges to be addressed. Unresolved issues include optimal patient selection, long clinical trial times, optimal dose, schedule and treatment duration. The use of biological surrogate markers for longer time-dependent trial endpoints could significantly contribute to more rapid development. Ongoing clinical studies, particularly in tobacco-related diseases, will better define the role of retinoids in this clinical setting. Clinicians should be encouraged to enter patients into large well organized clinical studies."
Do Prolonged Prophylactic Antibiotics Reduce the Incidence of Surgical-Site Infections in Immediate Prosthetic Breast Reconstruction?,"Wang, Chin, Piper, Esserman, Sbitany","Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27537226/,"About 50,000 women in the United States undergo mastectomy and immediate prosthetic breast reconstruction annually. Most receive postoperative prophylactic antibiotics.

The effect of these antibiotics on the risk of surgical-site infections remains unclear. The authors searched the Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases for studies that compared less than 24 hours and greater than 24 hours of antibiotics following immediate prosthetic breast reconstruction. Primary outcomes were surgical-site infections and implant loss. Conservative random effects models were used to obtain pooled relative risk estimates. The authors identified 927 studies, but only four cohort studies and one randomized controlled trial met their inclusion criteria. Unadjusted incidences of surgical-site infections were 14 percent with more than 24 hours of antibiotics, 19 percent with less than 24 hours of antibiotics, and 16 percent overall. Unadjusted incidences of implant loss were 8 percent with more than 24 hours of antibiotics, 10 percent with less than 24 hours of antibiotics, and 9 percent overall. The pooled relative risk of implant loss was 1.17 (95 percent CI, 0.39 to 3.6) with less than 24 hours of antibiotics, which was not statistically significant. Prolonged antibiotic use did not have a statistically significant effect on reducing surgical-site infections or implant loss. There was significant heterogeneity between studies, and prolonged antibiotics may have increased the risk of implant loss in the randomized controlled trial. Definitive evidence may only be obtained with data from more prospective randomized controlled trials."
Rhein inhibits angiogenesis and the viability of hormone-dependent and -independent cancer cells under normoxic or hypoxic conditions in vitro.,"Fernand, Losso, Truax, Villar, Bwambok, Fakayode, Lowry, Warner","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21457705/,"Rhein (4,5-dihydroxyanthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid) is a naturally occurring quinone which exhibits a variety of biologic activities including anti-cancer activity. Rhein inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF(165))-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) tube formation, proliferation and migration under normoxic and hypoxic conditions.","Hypoxia is a hallmark of solid tumors, including breast cancer, and the extent of tumor hypoxia is associated with treatment resistance and poor prognosis. Considering the limited treatment of hypoxic tumor cells and hence a poor prognosis of breast cancer, the investigation of natural products as potential chemopreventive anti-angiogenic agents is of paramount interest. Rhein (4,5-dihydroxyanthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid), the primary anthraquinone in the roots of Cassia alata L., is a naturally occurring quinone which exhibits a variety of biologic activities including anti-cancer activity. However, the effect of rhein on endothelial or cancer cells under hypoxic conditions has never been delineated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether rhein inhibits angiogenesis and the viability of hormone-dependent (MCF-7) or -independent (MDA-MB-435s) breast cancer cells in vitro under normoxic or hypoxic conditions. Rhein inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF(165))-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) tube formation, proliferation and migration under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. In addition, rhein inhibited in vitro angiogenesis by suppressing the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphorylated-AKT (p-AKT) and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK) but showed no inhibitory effects on total AKT or ERK. Rhein dose-dependently inhibited the viability of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-435s breast cancer cells under normoxic or hypoxic conditions, and inhibited cell cycle in both cell lines. Furthermore, Western blotting demonstrated that rhein inhibited heat shock protein 90alpha (Hsp90α) activity to induce degradation of Hsp90 client proteins including nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), COX-2, and HER-2. Rhein also inhibited the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF(165)), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and the phosphorylation of inhibitor of NF-κB (I-κB) under normoxic or hypoxic conditions. Taken together, these data indicate that rhein is a promising anti-angiogenic compound for breast cancer cell viability and growth. Therefore, further studies including in vivo and pre-clinical need to be performed."

Prospective epidemiologic studies supporting a protective effect of calcium on breast cancer risk have mainly been limited to Western populations. We examined the association between calcium intake and breast cancer risk in the Singapore Chinese Health Study, a large population-based prospective cohort. Calcium intake and supplement use was assessed by in-person interviewer using a validated food frequency questionnaire. After a mean follow-up of 14.2±3.5 years, 823 cohort participants developed invasive breast cancer. Multivariate proportional hazards regression models were fitted to examine the associations between calcium intake and breast cancer risk. Vegetables were the primary food source of calcium in this study population, followed by dairy products, grains and soy foods. Calcium intake was not associated with breast cancer risk, comparing highest quartile (>345.6 mg/1,000 kcal/day) to lowest quartile (<204.5 mg/1,000 kcal/day) of intake. There was no evidence of effect modification by menopausal status, body mass index, dietary vitamin D or stage of disease at diagnosis. Our findings do not support a hypothesis for calcium in breast cancer chemoprevention, contrary to findings from previous studies among Western populations with higher calcium intake primarily from dairy products and supplements."

Potential reduction of contralateral second breast-cancer risks by prophylactic mammary irradiation: validation in a breast-cancer-prone mouse model.,"Shuryak, Smilenov, Kleiman, Brenner","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Validation Study",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24376895/,Long-term breast-cancer survivors have a highly elevated risk (1 in 6 at 20 years) of contralateral second breast cancer. This high risk is associated with the presence of multiple pre-malignant cell clones. Mechanistic analyses suggest that a moderate dose of X-rays can kill these pre- malignant clones.,"Long-term breast-cancer survivors have a highly elevated risk (1 in 6 at 20 years) of contralateral second breast cancer. This high risk is associated with the presence of multiple pre-malignant cell clones in the contralateral breast at the time of primary breast cancer diagnosis. Mechanistic analyses suggest that a moderate dose of X-rays to the contralateral breast can kill these pre-malignant clones such that, at an appropriate Prophylactic Mammary Irradiation (PMI) dose, the long-term contralateral breast cancer risk in breast cancer survivors would be considerably decreased. To test the predicted relationship between PMI dose and cancer risk in mammary glands that have a high risk of developing malignancies. We tested the PMI concept using MMTV-PyVT mammary-tumor-prone mice. Mammary glands on one side of each mouse were irradiated with X-rays, while those on the other side were shielded from radiation. The unshielded mammary glands received doses of 0, 4, 8, 12 and 16 Gy in 4-Gy fractions. In high-risk mammary glands exposed to radiation doses designed for PMI (12 and 16 Gy), tumor incidence rates were respectively decreased by a factor of 2.2 (95% CI, 1.1-5.0) at 12 Gy, and a factor of 3.1 (95% CI, 1.3-8.3) at 16 Gy, compared to those in the shielded glands that were exposed to very low radiation doses. The same pattern was seen for PMI-exposed mammary glands relative to zero-dose controls. The pattern of cancer risk reduction by PMI was consistent with mechanistic predictions. Contralateral breast PMI may thus have promise as a spatially targeted breast-conserving option for reducing the current high risk of contralateral second breast cancers. For estrogen-receptor positive primary tumors, PMI might optimally be used concomitantly with systemically delivered chemopreventive drugs such as tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors, while for estrogen-receptor negative tumors, PMI might be used alone."
miR181b is induced by the chemopreventive polyphenol curcumin and inhibits breast cancer metastasis via down-regulation of the inflammatory cytokines CXCL1 and -2.,"Kronski, Fiori, Barbieri, Astigiano, Mirisola, Killian, Bruno, Pagani, Rovera, Pfeffer, Sommerhoff, Noonan, Nerlich, Fontana, Bachmeier",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24484937/,The chemopreventive polyphenol Curcumin inhibits the expression of the proinflammatory cytokines CXCL1 and -2 leading to diminished formation of breast and prostate cancer metastases. Overexpression or inhibition of miR181b in metastatic breast cancer cells has a significant impact on the two cytokines.,"Chronic inflammation is a major risk factor for the development and metastatic progression of cancer. We have previously reported that the chemopreventive polyphenol Curcumin inhibits the expression of the proinflammatory cytokines CXCL1 and -2 leading to diminished formation of breast and prostate cancer metastases. In the present study, we have analyzed the effects of Curcumin on miRNA expression and its correlation to the anti-tumorigenic properties of this natural occurring polyphenol. Using microarray miRNA expression analyses, we show here that Curcumin modulates the expression of a series of miRNAs, including miR181b, in metastatic breast cancer cells. Interestingly, we found that miR181b down-modulates CXCL1 and -2 through a direct binding to their 3'-UTR. Overexpression or inhibition of miR181b in metastatic breast cancer cells has a significant impact on CXCL1 and -2 and is required for the effect of Curcumin on these two cytokines. miR181b also mediates the effects of Curcumin on inhibition of proliferation and invasion as well as induction of apoptosis. Importantly, over-expression of miR181b in metastatic breast cancer cells inhibits metastasis formation in vivo in immunodeficient mice. Finally, we demonstrated that Curcumin up-regulates miR181b and down-regulates CXCL1 and -2 in cells isolated from several primary human breast cancers. Taken together, these data show that Curcumin provides a simple bridge to bring metastamir modulation into the clinic, placing it in a primary and tertiary preventive, as well as a therapeutic, setting."
Risk-benefit profiles of women using tamoxifen for chemoprevention.,"Nichols, DeRoo, Scharf, Sandler","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25475563/,Tamoxifen has been US Food and Drug Administration-approved for primary prevention of breast cancer since 1998.

Little is known about the risk-benefit profiles of women who use chemoprevention outside of a clinical trial. We examined characteristics associated with initiation and discontinuation of tamoxifen for primary prevention of breast cancer within a large cohort of women with a first-degree family history of breast cancer. This research was conducted within The Sister Study, a cohort of 50884 US and Puerto Rican women age 35 to 74 years enrolled from 2003 to 2009. Eligible women were breast cancer-free at enrollment and had a sister who had been diagnosed with breast cancer. Participants reported tamoxifen use, ages started and stopped taking tamoxifen, and total duration of use at enrollment. We identified 788 tamoxifen users and 3131 nonusers matched on age and year of enrollment who had no history of contraindicating factors (stroke, transient ischemic attack, cataract, endometrial or uterine cancer). Characteristics associated with tamoxifen initiation were evaluated with multivariable conditional logistic regression. All statistical tests were two-sided. Based on published risk-benefit indices, 20% of women who used tamoxifen had insufficient evidence that the benefits of tamoxifen outweigh the risk of serious side effects. After 4.5 years, 46% of women had discontinued tamoxifen. While the majority of women who used tamoxifen for primary prevention of breast cancer were likely to benefit, substantial discontinuation of tamoxifen before five years and use by women at risk of serious side effects may attenuate benefits for breast cancer prevention."

SSI is higher than expected after breast surgery. Obesity was found to be one of the risk factors. The trial was designed as a phase IV randomized, controlled, parallel-group efficacy trial. It was conducted at a tertiary university hospital. Overweight or obese women with clinically early-stage breast cancer who had been assigned to undergo surgery were eligible. Patients were randomly allocated to either a prophylaxis or a control group by using a computer-generated list. The prophylaxis group received 1 g ampicillin-sulbactam intravenously at anesthesia. The control group received no intervention. Patients and observers were blinded to the assignments. The primary outcome was the comparison of SSI incidences of the 2 groups. Patients were monitored for 30 days. A total of 369 patients were included in final analysis, out of which 187 were allocated for prophylaxis and 182 were randomly assigned to the control group. Analysis was done according to the intention-to-treat principle. Prophylaxis significantly reduced the SSI rate (4.8%) in the prophylaxis group when compared with that in the control group [13.7%; relative risk (RR) 0.35; 95% CI: 0.17-0.73]. No adverse reaction was observed. The mean SSI-related cost (20.26 USD) was found to be significantly higher in the control group when compared with that (8.48 USD) in the prophylaxis group. Antibiotic prophylaxis significantly decreased SSI incidence after elective surgery and was shown to be cost-effective in obese breast cancer patients. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00356148."

Postmenopausal women at increased risk for breast cancer (breast density ≥ 25%) were randomized to: (1) no intervention; (2) Ral 60 mg; (3) Ral 30 mg; (4) n-3FA (Lovaza) 4 g and (5) Lovaza 4 g+Ral 30 mg for 2 years. Reduction in breast density is the primary end point of the study. We report preliminary data on feasibility, compliance and changes in secondary end points related to IGF-I signaling, estrogen metabolism, oxidative stress and inflammation in the first group of 46 women who completed 1 year of the study. All interventions were well tolerated with excellent compliance (96 ± 1% overall) by pill count and also supported by the expected rise in both serum n-3FA and n-3FA/Omega-6 fatty acids (n-6FA) ratio in women randomized to groups 4 and 5 (P<0.05). Lovaza decreased serum triglycerides and increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol compared with control (P<0.05 for both). Ral reduced serum IGF-1 in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.05) while Lovaza did not. Lovaza had no effect on IGF-1 or IGFBP-3. None of the other biomarkers were affected by our treatment. The combination of Lovaza and Ral is a feasible strategy that may be recommended in future breast cancer chemoprevention trials."

Current subject selection protocols have relied upon epidemiological methods to identify high-risk individuals. Most available data provide risk estimates for various individual risk factors, but few have reported risk estimates for combinations of risk factors. Selection criteria for the large tamoxifen intervention trial (NSABP P1) were developed from the work of Gail et al. [1]. The Gail model takes into account non-genetic factors (e.g., nulliparity, age at menarche, preexisting pathological conditions) and genetic factors (family history). Using a lifetime risk of 10% of developing breast cancer as a standard to intervene, NSABP P1 uses the Gail algorithm to select pre- and postmenopausal women for a primary intervention trial. This approach has been criticized for being insufficiently selective (i.e., all women > or = 60 yrs), but appears to be the best available method to select subjects for a chemoprevention trial. Other approaches have been based on identification of very high-risk women with acknowledged pathologic conditions [lobular carcinoma in situ, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)]. Attempting to use these proliferative lesions as pathologic endpoints for drug effect has not been attempted. DCIS as a risk factor for tamoxifen intervention was excluded because of controversies over its management and because of frequent difficulties in distinguishing microinvasive from non-invasive lesions. Women treated for early stage breast cancer (Stage I) may be subjects for early stage chemopreventive interventions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

A retrospective cohort design and US healthcare claims data (2006-2011) were employed. Study subjects included adult patients receiving the following: docetaxel + cyclophosphamide (TC), 5-FU + epirubicin + cyclophosphamide (FEC), FEC followed by docetaxel (FEC → D), or docetaxel + carboplatin + trastuzumab (TCH) for non-metastatic breast cancer; TCH for metastatic breast cancer; 5-FU + leucovorin + irinotecan + oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) for metastatic pancreatic cancer; and bendamustine (with rituximab [BR], without rituximab [B-Mono]) for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). For each patient, the first qualifying chemotherapy course and each cycle therein were identified, as were the use of supportive care-colony-stimulating factors (CSF) and antimicrobials (AMB)-and unique FN episodes. The crude risk (incidence proportion) of FN during the chemotherapy course ranged from 8.8 (95 % CI 8.3-9.3) to 10.6 % (9.3-12.1) among the breast cancer regimens, was slightly higher for the NHL regimens (BR, 10.5 % [8.9-12.4]; B-Mono, 14.7 % [11.2-18.9]), and was markedly higher for FOLFIRINOX (24.7 % [17.9-33.1]). Most patients developing FN required inpatient care (range, 73-90 %). Use of CSF primary prophylaxis ranged from 17 (B-Mono) to 75 % (FEC → D); use of AMB primary prophylaxis ranged from 6 (FOLFIRINOX) to 13 % (B-Mono). The risk of FN among patients receiving selected emerging chemotherapy regimens is considerable, and most cases require inpatient care. Use of CSF and AMB prophylaxis, however, varies substantially across regimens."

Given data suggesting that increased circulating levels of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) factors are related to reduced TDLU involution and increased mammographic density, we assessed these relationships using validated quantitative methods in a cross-sectional study of women with benign breast disease. Serum IGF-I, IGFBP-3 and IGF-I:IGFBP-3 molar ratios were measured in 228 women, ages 40-64, who underwent diagnostic breast biopsies yielding benign diagnoses at University of Vermont affiliated centers. Biopsies were assessed for three separate measures inversely related to TDLU involution: numbers of TDLUs per unit of tissue area (""TDLU count""), median TDLU diameter (""TDLU span""), and number of acini per TDLU (""acini count""). Regression models, stratified by menopausal status and adjusted for potential confounders, were used to assess the associations of TDLU count, median TDLU span and median acini count per TDLU with tertiles of circulating IGFs. Given that mammographic density is associated with both IGF levels and breast cancer risk, we also stratified these associations by mammographic density. Higher IGF-I levels among postmenopausal women and an elevated IGF-I:IGFBP-3 ratio among all women were associated with higher TDLU counts, a marker of decreased lobular involution (P-trend = 0.009 and <0.0001, respectively); these associations were strongest among women with elevated mammographic density (P-interaction <0.01). Circulating IGF levels were not significantly associated with TDLU span or acini count per TDLU. These results suggest that elevated IGF levels may define a sub-group of women with high mammographic density and limited TDLU involution, two markers that have been related to increased breast cancer risk. If confirmed in prospective studies with cancer endpoints, these data may suggest that evaluation of IGF signaling and its downstream effects may have value for risk prediction and suggest strategies for breast cancer chemoprevention through inhibition of the IGF system."
Molecular subtyping of brain metastases and implications for therapy.,"Renfrow, Lesser",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23907440/,"Molecular subtyping of tumors and treatment with specifically targeted therapy is a rapidly developing trend in oncology. lung cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma comprise the most common diagnoses in patients with brain metastases. Newer targeted therapies represent an additional chemotherapeutic option.","Molecular subtyping of tumors and treatment with specifically targeted therapy is a rapidly developing trend in oncology. Genetic and protein biomarkers impact biological behavior, patient prognosis, and inform treatment options. Select examples include EGFR mutations in primary non-small cell lung cancers, Her2 overexpression in breast cancer, and BRAF mutations in melanoma. Systemic benefit is emphasized in targeted therapies; yet lung cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma comprise the most common diagnoses in patients with brain metastases making the effectiveness of targeted therapies in the treatment and/or prevention of brain metastases relevant.Emerging evidence suggests efficacy for targeted therapy in the setting of brain metastases. Randomized, phase III clinical trials indicate targeted HER2 treatment with lapatinib and capecitabine in brain metastases from breast cancer increases the time to progression and decreases the frequency of CNS involvement at progression. Phase II trials and retrospective reviews for gefitinib and erlotinib demonstrate these agents may have a role in both the chemoprevention of brain metastases and, in combination with WBRT, treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) brain metastases. Dabrafenib and other BRAF inhibitors have demonstrated improved survival in patients with brain metastases from melanoma in a recent phase II clinical trial. Further data that support the use of these agents are the subject of several active clinical trials. Challenges and future directions for targeted therapies in brain metastases include both better characterization and drug design with respect to central nervous system distribution. Limited published data demonstrate suboptimal CNS distribution of currently available targeted chemotherapeutic agents. Increasing systemic dosing, alternate delivery methods, and new compounds with improved CNS distribution are being pursued. Additionally, eventual resistance to targeted therapies poses a challenge; however, research is showing resistance mutations are conserved and relatively predictable creating opportunities for second-line therapies with additional targeted drugs. Newer targeted therapies represent an additional chemotherapeutic option for the treatment and/or prevention of brain metastases in patients with an appropriate molecular profile."
Selenium and the risk of postmenopausal breast cancer in the DOM cohort.,"van Noord, Maas, van der Tweel, Collette","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8518405/,"Selenium has been claimed to have chemo-preventive properties.

However, data showing that in humans selenium levels are already decreased prior to diagnosis of breast cancer were not available. Such information is mandatory before oral selenium supplementation in the primary prevention of (breast) cancer in humans is acceptable. This question of a 'preventive-potential' of selenium was evaluated in a case-control study nested in a cohort, because this design allows determination of the time-order of preceding selenium levels and subsequent cancer risk. The cohort consisted of 5577 women aged 55-70 years from the DOM project, a population based breast cancer screening program in the Netherlands. Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis was used to measure the selenium content of toenail clippings. The 69 cases of breast cancer found during follow-up after screening. represent 'recent' tumours since all women had a negative screening mammogram 3-5 years previously. No decreased selenium levels, as measured in nail clippings from the big toes, could be detected in cases-to-be, either when compared to 4 age matched controls per case or when compared with a random control group drawn from the entire cohort. On the contrary, a tendency for slightly higher selenium levels among 'future' cancer cases was observed. As to the sensitivity of detecting differences in selenium by nail clippings, lower selenium could be detected in nails of current smokers. The smoking-related decrease in nail selenium level was of the same order as the differences between breast cancer cases and controls, but was independent of the breast cancer risk.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

"Why Breast Cancer Risk by the Numbers Is Not Enough: Evaluation of a Decision Aid in Multi-Ethnic, Low-Numerate Women.","Kukafka, Yi, Xiao, Thomas, Aguirre, Smalletz, David, Crew","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26175193/,"RealRisks aims to improve preference-based decision-making for breast cancer prevention, particularly in low-numerate women. RealRisks incorporates experience-based dynamic interfaces to communicate risk. modules on breast cancer risk, genetic testing, and chemoprevention that are tailored.","Breast cancer risk assessment including genetic testing can be used to classify people into different risk groups with screening and preventive interventions tailored to the needs of each group, yet the implementation of risk-stratified breast cancer prevention in primary care settings is complex. To address barriers to breast cancer risk assessment, risk communication, and prevention strategies in primary care settings, we developed a Web-based decision aid, RealRisks, that aims to improve preference-based decision-making for breast cancer prevention, particularly in low-numerate women. RealRisks incorporates experience-based dynamic interfaces to communicate risk aimed at reducing inaccurate risk perceptions, with modules on breast cancer risk, genetic testing, and chemoprevention that are tailored. To begin, participants learn about risk by interacting with two games of experience-based risk interfaces, demonstrating average 5-year and lifetime breast cancer risk. We conducted four focus groups in English-speaking women (age ≥18 years), a questionnaire completed before and after interacting with the decision aid, and a semistructured group discussion. We employed a mixed-methods approach to assess accuracy of perceived breast cancer risk and acceptability of RealRisks. The qualitative analysis of the semistructured discussions assessed understanding of risk, risk models, and risk appropriate prevention strategies. Among 34 participants, mean age was 53.4 years, 62% (21/34) were Hispanic, and 41% (14/34) demonstrated low numeracy. According to the Gail breast cancer risk assessment tool (BCRAT), the mean 5-year and lifetime breast cancer risk were 1.11% (SD 0.77) and 7.46% (SD 2.87), respectively. After interacting with RealRisks, the difference in perceived and estimated breast cancer risk according to BCRAT improved for 5-year risk (P=.008). In the qualitative analysis, we identified potential barriers to adopting risk-appropriate breast cancer prevention strategies, including uncertainty about breast cancer risk and risk models, distrust toward the health care system, and perception that risk assessment to pre-screen women for eligibility for genetic testing may be viewed as rationing access to care. In a multi-ethnic population, we demonstrated a significant improvement in accuracy of perceived breast cancer risk after exposure to RealRisks. However, we identified potential barriers that suggest that accurate risk perceptions will not suffice as the sole basis to support informed decision making and the acceptance of risk-appropriate prevention strategies. Findings will inform the iterative design of the RealRisks decision aid."

National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and other international guidelines recommend genetic-testing at a ~10% probability threshold of carrying a BRCA-mutation. A detailed three generation family-history (FH) of cancer is used within complex mathematical models (e.g. BOADICEA, BRCAPRO, Manchester-Scoring-System) or through standardized clinical-criteria to identify individuals who fulfil this probability threshold and can be offered genetic-testing.

Clinical applications of retinoids in cancer medicine.,Camacho,"Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12757024/,The retinoids are compounds structurally related to vitamin A.

The most extensively studied agents in cancer medicine include all-trans-retinoic acid, 9-cis-retinoic acid, and 13-cis-retinoic acid. In addition to several described immune regulatory functions, these agents may exert their antineoplastic effects through the regulation of tumor suppressor genes such as RAR-beta2. The survival benefit provided to patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) after induction therapy with all-trans RA and the responses experienced by patients with cutaneous lesions from Kaposi's sarcoma and cutaneous T cell lymphoma treated with 9-cis RA and a selective rexinoid--bexarotene--respectively, led to their approval by the Food and Drug Administration during the last decade. As chemopreventive agents, retinoids have proven to effectively regress laryngeal papillomatosis and oral leukoplakia lesions. The ability of 13-cis-RA to prevent second primary malignancies in patients with carcinoma of the head and neck has also been demonstrated. Unfortunately, this intervention did not affect the primary tumor recurrence rates. The toxicity and efficacy of retinoids administered in combination with other biological and cytotoxic agents have also been explored in patients with renal cell carcinoma, breast cancer, myelodysplasia, prostate, cervix, and other malignancies with a broad range of reported responses. Further characterization of the molecular processes modulated by these agents will serve to better define their role in the prevention and treatment of human cancer and to tailor specific targeted therapies in combination with other compounds. Newer and more selective retinoids and rexinoids are completing phase I and phase II studies and hold promising."

Each breast was taken as an individual unit in 1,628 patients, and data for 3,256 breasts were analyzed. Superficial infection was seen in 38 breasts (all unilateral), with an incidence of 1.2%. Periprosthetics infection was observed in 17 breasts (13 unilateral and 2 bilateral), giving an infection incidence of 0.52%.","Infections after augmentation mammoplasty are not uncommon, and prophylactic antibiotics are routinely administered to minimize infection. However, there is paucity of information on the relationship between the length of prophylaxis cover and its benefits in primary augmentation mammoplasty. A retrospective analysis of different antibiotic cover regimens, their effectiveness in preventing infections, and the management of infection in established cases is reviewed. A retrospective chart analysis of periprosthetic infections in primary augmentation mammoplasties performed over the past 10 years was conducted. Periprosthetic infection was determined by the presence of pain, swelling, redness, and discharge. Each breast was taken as an individual unit in 1,628 patients, and data for 3,256 breasts were analyzed. The patients had their augmentation in the partial submuscular plane (214 breasts in 107 patients), the subglandular plane (1,548 breasts in 774 patients), and the muscle-splitting biplane (1,494 breasts in 747 patients). All the patients had soft round cohesive gel silicone implants. Of the 3,256 implants, 3,218 were textured, and 38 were smooth surfaced. The patients received antibiotics as a single intravenous dose of cephalosporin (474 breasts in 237 patients), a single intravenous dose plus an oral dose for 24 h (344 breasts in 172 patients), or a single intravenous dose plus an oral course for 5 days (2,438 breasts in 1,219 patients). Infection was recorded as superficial (e.g., wound breakdown, stitch extrusion, stitch abscess) or deep (periprosthetic). The patients with established periprosthetic infections, determined clinically by the presence of pain, discharge, swelling, and redness of the breasts, were managed either conservatively using antibiotics, passive wound drainage, and healing of the wound with secondary intention or by explantation and replacement after 3 to 4 months. In selected cases of periprosthetic infection, the implants were removed after a course of antibiotics and negative swab cultures. The cavity was washed thoroughly with betadine and saline, and new implants were simultaneously reimplanted. The incidence of infection was lowest with a single perioperative dose of intravenous antibiotic compared with a combination of intravenous and oral antibiotics. Superficial infection was seen in 38 breasts (all unilateral), with an incidence of 1.2%, and periprosthetic infection was observed in 17 breasts (13 unilateral and 2 bilateral), giving an infection incidence of 0.52% (p = 0.002). In patients with a single intravenous dose of antibiotic, superficial and periprosthetic infection was seen in four breasts (0.8%) and no breasts, respectively. The difference was not significant (p = 0.13). The patients receiving a single intravenous antibiotic and a 24-h oral antibiotic had superficial and periprosthetic infection rates of 2.3% (8 breasts) and 0.3% (1 breast), respectively, and the difference between the two sub-groups was significantly higher (p = 0.04). The patients receiving an intravenous antibiotic and 5 days of oral antibiotics had superficial and periprosthetic infection rates of 1.1% (26 breasts) and 0.65% (14 breasts), respectively. The difference between the two subgroups was not significant (p = 0.09). Of the 17 periprosthetic infections in 15 patients (13 unilateral and 2 bilateral), 11 breasts (1 bilateral and 9 unilateral) were treated conservatively using antibiotics, passive drainage, and wound healing with secondary intention. Capsular contracture developed in two of the conservatively treated breasts, requiring capsulotomies with change of implants. Of the six periprosthetic infections in six patients, requiring surgical intervention, two implants were treated using explantation with immediate replacement after a course of antibiotics and a negative culture, and two implants were explanted followed by reimplantation later. One patient had both implants removed after unilateral infection, and no reimplantation was performed. One patient had a bilateral infection. In this case, one implant was explanted and the other was treated conservatively. The patient had bilateral reimplantion 6 months later, and bilateral Baker 4 capsular contracture developed in both breasts within 6 months. No other complications were seen in the patients who underwent surgery. A single dose of intravenous antibiotic is adequate for prophylaxis in breast augmentation surgery, and the extra duration of antibiotic cover does not result in reduced superficial or periprosthetic infections. Infection can be managed in more than one way depending on the nature, degree, and extent of infection."

The literature search was designed to combine three concepts: implant or tissue expander-based breast surgery, antibiotic irrigation and clinical infection or capsular contracture. Studies found were screened using specific eligibility criteria. Risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using pooled acquired data from all included studies. The search identified 1256 citations. Three independent screeners identified seven studies that met the inclusion criteria with a pooled population of 4725. This included one prospective and six retrospective studies. A meta-analysis of pooled study data showed significant reductions in clinical infection (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.33-0.81) and capsular contracture (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.16-0.83) as a result of antibiotic irrigation. The meta-analyses support the use of antibiotic irrigation of the breast pocket.

Today, premenopausal women with increased risk for breast cancer have only limited nonsurgical options to reduce their risk. The GISS trial, a randomized, multicenter, open-label phase II trial, assessed the feasibility of a preventive treatment with goserelin and ibandronate for premenopausal women at increased risk for breast cancer. The primary endpoints were refusal to undergo randomization and discontinuation of treatment. Safety and quality of life were also evaluated. Between the years 2001 and 2003, 31 of 322 eligible women participated in the trial; 15 received goserelin/ibandronate plus screening, 15 screening only, and 1 withdrew her consent after randomization. The treatment duration was 24 months. Here, mainly the results from the first 12 months were evaluated because of the low compliance thereafter. Hot flushes, headache, and vaginal dryness/discharge occurred more often in the goserelin arm. No difference was observed between the two arms in the agreement to randomization, compliance, or any other endpoints. Acceptance of chemoprevention with goserelin and ibandronate was low. Premenopausal women at increased risk for breast cancer should be better informed about chemoprevention through physician counseling and a more feasible study design (e.g., oral medication) should be provided. This is the first chemoprevention trial in premenopausal women at increased risk for breast cancer."

"Cytomorphology as a risk predictor: experience with fine needle aspiration biopsy, nipple fluid aspiration, and ductal lavage.",Masood,"Journal Article, Review",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16308095/,Primary prevention of breast cancer requires identification and elimination of cancer-causing agents. Secondary prevention involves screening individuals who are at increased risk for breast cancer. Administration of tamoxifen reduced the risk for invasive and noninvasive breast cancer by almost 50% in all age groups.,"Primary prevention of breast cancer requires identification and elimination of cancer-causing agents, which is an incredibly difficult task to follow. Secondary prevention involves screening individuals who are at increased risk for breast cancer in hopes that early intervention will affect survival. In the 1980s, chemoprevention received serious attention. This approach was aimed at reducing cancer risk by administration of natural or synthetic clinical compounds that prevent, reverse, or suppress carcinogenesis in individuals at increased risk for cancer. It was not until 1998, however, when the first report from the National Surgical Adjunct Breast and Bowel Project (Breast Cancer Prevention Trial BCPT; P-1) randomized clinical trial appeared in the literature supporting the hypothesis that breast can-cer can be prevented. This study showed that administration of tamoxifen reduced the risk for invasive and noninvasive breast cancer by almost 50% in all age groups. With the current availability of tamoxifen as a chemopreventive agent and with the increasing emphasis on early breast cancer detection and prevention, more women seek consultation to determine their risk for breast cancer. However, in the absence of any detectable breast lesion, clinically and mammographically, only a few women may volunteer to have their breasts sampled by surgical biopsy for risk assessment. Other non-surgical procedures include fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB), nipple aspirate fluid (NAF), and the recently introduced procedure, ductal lavage. These techniques may provide better alternatives. These minimally invasive procedures are capable of recruiting cellular material for cytomorphologic interpretation and biomarker studies."
Correlation between tamoxifen elimination and biomarker recovery in a primary prevention trial.,"Guerrieri-Gonzaga, Baglietto, Johansson, Bonanni, Robertson, Sandri, Canigiula, Lampreda, Diani, Lien, Decensi","Clinical Trial, Journal Article, Randomized Controlled Trial, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11535549/,"Tamoxifen, N-desmethyltamox ifen, and biomarker levels were measured at 0 (baseline), 2, 4, and 6 weeks after completion of treatment in 23 healthy postmenopausal women. Compared with baseline values, the percentage increase in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and insulin-like growth factor-I 4 weeks after treatment completion was 5, 9, and 14%, respectively. No change during the 6-week period was observed in the placebo arm.","We have shown previously that a reduction from the conventional dose of tamoxifen is associated with a comparable modulation of circulating biomarkers, including insulin-like growth factor-I and cholesterol. In the present study, we have correlated serum tamoxifen elimination with biomarker recovery in healthy subjects completing a 5-year intervention period. Tamoxifen, N-desmethyltamoxifen, and biomarker levels were measured at 0 (baseline), 2, 4, and 6 weeks after completion of treatment in 23 healthy postmenopausal women allocated to tamoxifen 20 mg/day and in 6 women allocated to placebo. Mean (+/-SD) serum tamoxifen and N-desmethyltamoxifen concentrations were, respectively, 141 +/- 50 and 226 +/- 77 ng/ml at baseline, 36 +/- 19 and 99 +/- 46 at 2 weeks, 20 +/- 15 and 61 +/- 37 at 4 weeks, and 12 +/- 9 and 36 +/- 26 at 6 weeks. Serum tamoxifen and N-desmethyltamoxifen half-lives were 9 and 13 days, respectively. Body mass index was associated positively with drug's serum half-life. Compared with baseline values, the percentage increase in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and insulin-like growth factor-I 4 weeks after treatment completion was 5, 9, and 14%, respectively. No change during the 6-week period was observed in the placebo arm. Our findings indicate that the biomarker recovery is slower than serum tamoxifen elimination, suggesting that low tamoxifen concentrations may still exert a biological effect. In addition, the prolonged half-life of tamoxifen and metabolite provides the rationale for a weekly administration of the drug in a preventive context. However, the clinical implications of our findings remain to be defined."
Interim analysis of the incidence of breast cancer in the Royal Marsden Hospital tamoxifen randomised chemoprevention trial.,"Powles, Eeles, Ashley, Easton, Chang, Dowsett, Tidy, Viggers, Davey","Clinical Trial, Journal Article, Randomized Controlled Trial, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9672274/,"Tamoxifen, a drug with antioestrogenic effects, is predicted to prevent the occurrence of breast cancer.

We have undertaken a trial of tamoxifen in healthy women who are at increased risk of breast cancer because of family history. We report a planned interim analysis. Between October, 1986, and April, 1996, we accrued 2494 healthy women aged between 30 and 70 with a family history of breast cancer. They have been randomised (double blind) to receive tamoxifen 20 mg per day orally or placebo for up to 8 years. Follow-up included clinical assessment, annual mammography, and assessment of toxicity and compliance. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of breast cancer, which was analysed on an intention-to-treat basis with a survival curve. With a median follow-up of 70 months, 2471 women (tamoxifen 1238, placebo 1233) were suitable for analysis. The groups were evenly matched at baseline, and compliance was good. The overall frequency of breast cancer is the same for women on tamoxifen or placebo (tamoxifen 34, placebo 36, relative risk 1.06 [95% CI 0.7-1.7], p=0.8). Participants who were already on hormone-replacement therapy when they entered the study had an increased risk of breast cancer compared with non-users. Those participants who started such therapy while on trial had a significantly reduced risk. The safety profile of tamoxifen was as expected. We have been unable to show any effect of tamoxifen on breast-cancer incidence in healthy women, contrary to the report from the NSABP-P1 study showing a 45% reduction in healthy women given tamoxifen versus placebo. Differences in the study populations for the two trials may underlie these conflicting findings: eligibility in our trial was based predominantly on a strong family history of breast cancer whereas in the NSABP trial was mostly based on non-genetic risk factors. The importance of oestrogen promotion may vary between such populations."
Factors affecting breast cancer risk reduction practices among California physicians.,"Kaplan, Haas, Pérez-Stable, Des Jarlais, Gregorich","Comparative Study, Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15916987/,"Little is known about the incorporation of breast cancer risk reduction therapies into clinical practice.

We assessed factors related to physicians' performance of breast cancer risk reduction practices through a self-administered survey. Subjects were California physicians in family medicine, internal medicine, or obstetrics/gynecology, identified through the AMA Masterfile. Physicians reported their breast cancer risk reduction practices (initiating patient counseling, referring patients for genetic evaluation, and prescribing tamoxifen or raloxifene) as well as barriers to counseling. Of 1647 eligible physicians, 822 responded. Eighty-six percent reported initiating counseling, 45% referred a patient for genetic evaluation, 31% prescribed raloxifene, and 11% prescribed tamoxifen for breast cancer prevention in the past year. The leading frequent barriers to counseling were ""not enough time"" (40.3%) and ""insufficiently informed about risk reduction options"" (19.1%). Multivariate analysis showed that a training and role factors scale was negatively associated with all risk reduction practices, and number of breast cancer diagnoses per year was positively associated with referring for genetic evaluation and prescribing chemoprevention. Physicians in primary care specialties report participation in several breast cancer risk reduction activities. Issues related to physician training and role in risk reduction affect the implementation of these practices."

We surveyed 360 women who were at increased risk for breast cancer regarding social and behavioral factors that could influence their decision to enroll or not to enroll in the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial (BCPT). Respondents completed a questionnaire following attendance at an informational session about the trial. The analysis was restricted to 175 women who discussed the possibility of their participation in the trial with their primary care physician (PCP) and who reported what their physician advised them to do regarding participation. Logistic regression modeling showed that among women who discussed the trial with their physician, physician recommendation was the most important factor that influenced the respondent's decision to enroll in the BCPT. Women who reported that their physician advised them to enroll in the trial were 13 times more likely to participate than were women who reported that their physicians advised them not to participate. The results of our study show that PCPs play an important role in influencing preventive health behavior, specifically, regarding enrollment in a randomized breast cancer chemoprevention trial. Efforts to increase recruitment to a trial should include enlisting the support of PCPs."
Women's regrets after bilateral prophylactic mastectomy.,"Payne, Biggs, Tran, Borgen, Massie","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10761795/,"Bilateral prophylactic mastectomy (PM) has received increasingly more attention as management options for women at high risk of developing breast cancer. Although a PM statistically reduces the chances of a woman developing cancer, the possibility of significant physical and psychological sequelae remains. We discuss recommendations for the appropriate surgical and psychiatric evaluation of women who are considering a PM as risk-reducing surgery.","Primary prevention strategies such as chemopreventive agents (e.g., tamoxifen) and bilateral prophylactic mastectomy (PM) have received increasingly more attention as management options for women at high risk of developing breast cancer. A total of 370 women, who had registered in the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center National Prophylactic Mastectomy Registry, reported having undergone a bilateral PM. Twenty-one of these women expressed regrets about their decision to have a PM. A psychiatrist and psychologist interviewed 19 of the women about their experiences with the PM. A physician-initiated rather than patient-initiated discussion about the PM represented the most common factor in these women. Psychological distress and the unavailability of psychological and rehabilitative support throughout the process were the most commonly reported regrets. Additional regrets about the PM related to cosmesis, perceived difficulty of detecting breast cancer in the remaining breast tissue, surgical complications, residual pain, lack of education about the procedure, concerns about consequent body image, and sexual dysfunction. Although a PM statistically reduces the chances of a woman developing breast cancer, the possibility of significant physical and psychological sequelae remains. Careful evaluation, education, and support both before and after the procedure will potentially reduce the level of distress and dissatisfaction in these women. We discuss recommendations for the appropriate surgical and psychiatric evaluation of women who are considering a PM as risk-reducing surgery."
Sir James Young Simpson Memorial Lecture 1995. Breast cancer prevention: a pathologist's approach.,Simpson,Lecture,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8997020/,"Preliminary analysis of the effects of mammographic screening suggests that there will be a real but small fall in overall mortality. Existing practice involves three stages: first, the 'earliest' detection of a lump by palpation or imaging.","Few would argue that there is not substantial room for an improvement in breast cancer practice. It has to be borne in mind that the United Kingdom experience in the 1980s was a 50:50 survival to death ratio in the 10 years after diagnosis. Preliminary analysis of the effects of mammographic screening suggests that there will be a real but small fall in overall mortality. Existing practice involves three stages: first, the 'earliest' detection of a lump by palpation or imaging; second, diagnosis by histopathology; and third, treatment by surgery, etc. Evidence is given that the limited success of existing practice could be due, in part, to a failure to recognize the precancerous state of the mammary tissue as a whole in cancer cases; and a failure to exploit this state for earlier diagnosis. In support of these contentions, comparative data from the microscopy of cancer-associated breasts and age-matched normal breast are given. There is a gross excess of focal hyperplasia in premenopausal cancer-associated breast tissue. Further, epidemiological data are consistent in that the tissue is subject to a sixfold increase in the risk of further primary carcinogenesis. A method is presented for detecting the cancer-associated breast. It exploits the breast menstrual cycle, a subject which is reviewed in extenso. Physiologically the premenopausal mammary tissue goes into a monthly pregnancy rehearsal with glandular proliferation and increased blood supply. The latter effects a luteal heat cycle, which can be measured readily by an electronic thermometric bra as increased breast surface temperature (1 degree C). Data are presented in terms of 50 normal breasts and 41 cancer-associated breasts studied daily (with progesterone assays) for one menstrual cycle. The cancer-associated breasts exhibit an absent or altered response to endogenous progesterone during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. The abnormality in the luteal heat cycle is maximal during the few days just after ovulation. Our data indicate that a 1-h clinical test at this time achieves a sensitivity of 71% and a specificity of 80% for ""clinically normal' yet cancer-associated breast tissue. Such patients would be candidates for increased surveillance and chemoprevention."
MicroRNA signature in the chemoprevention of functionally-enriched stem and progenitor pools (FESPP) by Active Hexose Correlated Compound (AHCC).,"Graham, Mallet, Jambi, Nishioka, Homma, Matar",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28886271/,Active Hexose Correlated Compound (AHCC) is a cultured mushroom mycelium extract shown to favorably modulate the immune system and alleviate cancer burden.

CSCs can be epigenetically regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs),"Many breast cancer patients use natural compounds in their battle against breast cancer. Active Hexose Correlated Compound (AHCC®) is a cultured mushroom mycelium extract shown to favorably modulate the immune system and alleviate cancer burden. Cancer Stem cells (CSCs) are a subset of highly tumorigenic cancer cells that are thought to be responsible for recurrence. CSCs can be epigenetically regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs). We hypothesized that AHCC may influence CSCs by modulating tumor-suppressor or oncogenic miRNAs. Functionally-enriched stem and progenitor pools (FESPP) were isolated in the form of mammospheres from MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and 4T1 cells, exposed to AHCC in both regular and primary culture from Balb/c mice, and analyzed by visual counting and flow cytometry. Cell motility was also observed in MDA-MB-231 cells. Profiling and RT-qPCR were performed to determine AHCC influence on miRNAs in MDA-MB-231 mammospheres. Additionally, Balb/c mice were orally gavaged with AHCC, and tumor growth parameters and miR-335 expression were analyzed. MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with miR-335 and analyzed by western blot. We demonstrated that AHCC reduced mammosphere growth in three cell lines and in primary culture, prevented cell migration, and upregulated miR-335 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells and mouse tumor samples. Among the differentially regulated miRNAs in CSCs, we focused on tumor suppressor miR-335, known to target extracellular matrix protein Tenascin C (TNC). TNC is involved in CSC immune evasion pathways. In MDA-MB-231, inhibition of miR-335 increased TNC protein expression. These results support that AHCC limits FESPP growth, partly by targeting miRNA pathways."
Tamoxifen may prevent both ER+ and ER- breast cancers and select for ER- carcinogenesis: an alternative hypothesis.,"Esserman, Ozanne, Dowsett, Slingerland",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16457695/,"Breast Cancer Prevention Trial (BCPT) and Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene (MORE) data have been interpreted to indicate that tamoxifen reduces the risk of ER+ but not ER- breast carcinogenesis.

We explored whether these data also support an alternative hypothesis, that tamoxifen influences the natural history of both ER+ and ER- cancers, that it may be equally effective in abrogating or delaying ER- and ER+ carcinogenesis, and place selection pressure, in some cases, for the outgrowth of ER- cancers. BCPT and MORE data were used to investigate whether: first, tamoxifen could reduce equally the emergence of ER- and ER+ tumors; and second, tamoxifen could select a fraction of emerging ER+ cancers and promote their transformation to ER- cancers. Assuming that some proportion, Z, of ER+ tumors becomes ER- after tamoxifen exposure and that the risk reduction for both ER- and ER+ tumors is equal, we solved for both the transformation rate and the risk reduction rate. If tamoxifen equally reduces the incidence of ER+ and ER- tumors by 60%, the BCPT results are achieved with a transformation of approximately Z = 20% of ER+ to ER- tumors. Validation with MORE data using an equal risk reduction of 60% associated with tamoxifen produces an almost identical transformation rate Z of 23%. Data support an alternative hypothesis that tamoxifen may promote ER- carcinogenesis from a precursor lesion that would otherwise have developed as ER+ without tamoxifen selection."
