Social determinants of health related to adhesion to mammography screening.,"Moreira, Fernandes, Castro, Oliveira, Pinheiro",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29324950/,"The social determinants of health are directly related to the levels of adherence to the exam among women. The domain with the greatest influence on adhesion to mammography was perceived barriers. The age group of 60-64 years was highlighted, 22 (55.0%) women had a stable partner and 14 (65.0) completed higher education.","To identify proximal, intermediary and individual social determinants related to mammography adherence, according to the Social Determinants of Health model proposed by Dahlgren and Whitehead. Method: Correlational cross-sectional study, carried out with a sociodemographic and clinical data questionnaire and the Champion's Health Belief Model Scale, translated and adapted for use in Brazil. Data analyzed by multiple linear regression, from the domains scale, and sociodemographic and clinical variables were used as predictors. The age group of 60-64 years (55.0%) was highlighted, 22 (55.0%) women had a stable partner; and 14 (65.0%) completed higher education. The domain with the greatest influence on adhesion to mammography was perceived barriers. The social determinants of health are directly related to the levels of adherence to the exam among women, as well as the perceived benefits, susceptibilities and barriers."
The Effect of Disability and Social Determinants of Health on Breast and Cervical Cancer Screenings During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Rolle, Chery, Larson, Lopez-Pentecost, Calfa, Schlumbrecht, Crane",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38271492/,The objective of this study was to examine the effect of disability status and social determinants of health (SDOH) on adherence to breast and cervical cancer screening recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a secondary analysis of the 2018 and 2020 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data sets.,"The objective of this study was to examine the effect of disability status and social determinants of health (SDOH) on adherence to breast and cervical cancer screening recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a secondary analysis of the 2018 and 2020 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data sets. We defined adherence to screenings according to the US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines for breast and cervical cancer screening. The analysis included respondents assigned female at birth, aged 50 to 74 years (breast cancer screening) or aged 21 to 65 years (cervical cancer screening). We performed logistic regression to evaluate breast and cervical cancer screening adherence, by disability status and SDOH (health insurance coverage, marital status, and urban residency), independently and simultaneously. Our analysis included 27,526 BRFSS respondents in 2018 and 2020. In 2018, women with disabilities had lower adjusted odds than women without disabilities of being up to date with mammograms (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.76, 95% CI, 0.63-0.93) and Pap (Papanicolaou) tests (AOR = 0.73; 95% CI, 0.59-0.89). In 2020, among women with disabilities, the adjusted odds of mammogram and Pap test adherence decreased (AOR = 0.69; 95% CI, 0.54-0.89; AOR = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.47-0.75, respectively). In 2018, the adjusted odds of mammogram adherence among rural residents with and without disabilities were 0.83 (95% CI, 0.70-0.98), which decreased to 0.76 (95% CI, 0.62-0.93) in 2020. The findings of this study highlight the effect of disability status and SDOH on breast and cervical cancer screening rates during the COVID-19 pandemic. Public health strategies that acknowledge and address these disparities are crucial in preparing for future public health crises."
"Social determinants of mammography screening among women aged 50 to 59, Peru 2015.","Chang-Cabanillas, Peñafiel-Sam, Alarcón-Guevara, Pereyra-Elías",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32628571/,"The higher the socioeconomic status, the higher the prevalence of screening. Social inequalities in screening access exist and might translate into inequalities in cancer morbidity and mortality. The Peruvian government urgently needs to improve screening rates in these vulnerable populations.","Breast cancer (BC) screening could reduce its mortality; however, its access is influenced by societal forces. Our objective is to identify the social determinants associated with mammography screening (MS) in women aged 50 to 59 in Peru. In this cross-sectional analysis of the Peruvian Demographic Health Survey, 2015, MS within the past two years was evaluated through self-report. Prevalence for MS was 21.9% [95% CI: 18.9 to 25.1]. The average age was 54 years (s.d.: 2.5). The higher the socioeconomic status, the higher the prevalence of screening (3.2% vs 41.4% in extreme quintiles, <i>p</i> < .001). In the adjusted models, higher socioeconomic status (PR: 5.81, 95% CI: 2.28 to 14.79), higher education level (PR: 2.03, 95% CI: 1.30 a 3,15) and having health insurance from the Ministry of Health (PR: 2.21, 95% CI: 1.28 to 3.82) and EsSalud (PR: 4.37, 95% CI: 2.67 to 7.15), were positively associated with MS. Social inequalities in screening access exist and might translate into inequalities in cancer morbidity and mortality. The Peruvian government urgently needs to improve screening rates in these vulnerable populations."
Turning the Page on Breast Cancer in Ohio: Lessons learned from implementing a multilevel intervention to reduce breast cancer mortality among Black women.,"Padamsee, Stover, Tarver, Washington, Baltic, DeGraffinreid, Whiting, Rumano, Lee, Nolan, Oppong, Obeng-Gyasi, Toland, Bernardo, Hampel, Paskett","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37691524/,"Turning the Page on Breast Cancer (TPBC) aims to reduce breast cancer mortality among Black women in Ohio. Ohio has among the worst BC mortality rates in the United States for Black women. TPBC intervenes by improving health care facilities' ability to conduct effective BC screening, follow-up, and treatment.","Turning the Page on Breast Cancer (TPBC) uses a multilevel approach to reduce breast cancer (BC) mortality among Black women. TPBC intervenes by (1) improving health care facilities' ability to conduct effective BC screening, follow-up, and treatment; (2) involving community-based organizations; and (3) providing education and personal risk information through a culturally relevant website. Ohio has among the worst BC mortality rates in the United States for Black women. TPBC is in its third year of providing targeted interventions in 12 Ohio counties with particularly high BC rates among Black women. TPBC enrolls health care facilities, collects organizational and patient data, and conducts key informant interviews to inform the provision of appropriate evidence-based interventions. TPBC engages Black communities through community-based organizations and social media advertising. The TPBC website offers BC information, connects Black women to community BC resources, and provides access to a risk-assessment tool. TPBC has provided tailored information packets, evidence-based interventions, and systematic support for improving the tracking and follow-up of breast health care among patients in 10 clinical partnerships. The project has provided education at community events monthly since mid-2021. The TPBC website (http://endbreastcancerohio.org) is promoted through social media (primarily Facebook) and community events to reach Black women aged 25-70 years. To date, 4108 unique users have visited the website, of whom 15.9% completed the risk assessment. Novel strategies are needed to address persistent disparities in BC outcomes among Black women. TPBC demonstrates the potential effectiveness of multiple methods of community-based, clinic-based, and web-based engagement. Turning the Page on Breast Cancer (TPBC) aims to reduce breast cancer mortality among Black women in Ohio by conducting multilevel, community-engaged interventions in 12 counties. Women are provided risk information and education at virtual and in-person community events and through a community-friendly website that was launched in November 2020. Almost 4000 women have visited the website, which offers community-targeted information, urges screening for individuals at elevated risk, and offers access to patient navigation services; 655 users have used a breast cancer risk-assessment tool on the site. Community-based organizations conduct educational efforts. TPBC partners with health care facilities, which are taught to improve their ability to conduct effective breast cancer screening, follow-up, and treatment. So far, TPBC has provided educational information, evidence-based intervention lists, tailored information packets, and ongoing quarterly support to partners in 10 counties. Evaluation will focus on aggregated data for screening and genetic testing referral at the clinic level."
Factors Associated with Adherence to Routine Screening Mammography in HIV-Infected Women.,"Weinstein, Battaglia, Baranoski",Journal Article,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27168388/,Both HIV-infected women and minority women have historically lower rates of screening mammography. The objective of this study was to identify factors related to adherence to routine screening mammogram in a diverse inner-city cohort of HIV- infected women. Future programs targeting screening must be mindful of the multiple predictors of adherence.,"Both HIV-infected women and minority women have historically lower rates of screening mammography. The objective of this study was to identify factors related to adherence to routine screening mammography in a diverse inner-city cohort of HIV-infected women, to inform future work on targeted interventions to address disparities. This retrospective cohort study reviewed the electronic medical record of HIV-infected women aged 40 and older engaged in care between October 1, 2003 and March 31, 2008 at a large urban safety-net HIV clinic. Analyses included chi square testing and multivariate logistic regression to assess for patient-specific factors associated with adherence to breast cancer screening, defined as obtaining a screening mammogram within 2 years of engaging in care. The 292 women were a racially diverse group, with 70% black, 11% Hispanic, and 42% foreign born. There was suboptimal HIV control, with only 33% having an undetectable viral load (VL). One hundred forty-six (50%) were adherent to screening mammography. In multivariate analysis, women who were foreign born (OR 2.65 [CI 1.52-4.64]) had not completed high school (OR 1.77 [CI 1.06-2.95]) or had an undetectable VL (OR 2.51 [CI 1.44-4.40]) had increased odds of obtaining a mammogram. Among a racially diverse urban population of HIV-infected women engaged in care, only half had a mammogram. Foreign-born women had higher odds of undergoing mammography, suggesting that nativity status and social determinants of health are under-recognized drivers of adherence in this population. Future programs targeting screening must be mindful of the multiple predictors of adherence."
