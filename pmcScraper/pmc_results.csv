Metformin is a potential therapeutic for COVID-19/LUAD by regulating glucose metabolism,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11137110,Article,"Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common and aggressive subtype of lung cancer, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a serious public health threat worldwide. Patients with LUAD and COVID-19 have a poor prognosis. Therefore, finding medications that can be used to treat COVID-19/LUAD patients is essential. Bioinformatics analysis was used to identify 20 possible metformin target genes for the treatment of COVID-19/LUAD. PTEN and mTOR may serve as hub target genes of metformin. Metformin may be able to cure COVID-19/LUAD comorbidity through energy metabolism, oxidoreductase NADH activity, FoxO signalling pathway, AMPK signalling system, and mTOR signalling pathway, among other pathways, according to the results of bioinformatic research. Metformin has ability to inhibit the proliferation of A549 cells, according to the results of colony formation and proliferation assays. In A549 cells, metformin increased glucose uptake and lactate generation, while decreasing ATP synthesis and the NAD","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11137110/bin/41598_2024_63081_MOESM1_ESM.xlsx, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11137110/bin/41598_2024_63081_MOESM2_ESM.xlsx, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11137110/bin/41598_2024_63081_MOESM3_ESM.xlsx, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11137110/bin/41598_2024_63081_MOESM4_ESM.xlsx, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11137110/bin/41598_2024_63081_MOESM5_ESM.xlsx, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11137110/bin/41598_2024_63081_MOESM6_ESM.docx"
