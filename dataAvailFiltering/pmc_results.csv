Oxidative Stress in Breast Cancer: A Biochemical Map of Reactive Oxygen Species Production,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11120394,Review,"This review systematizes information about the metabolic features of breast cancer directly related to oxidative stress. It has been shown those redox changes occur at all levels and affect many regulatory systems in the human body. The features of the biochemical processes occurring in breast cancer are described, ranging from nonspecific, at first glance, and strictly biochemical to hormone-induced reactions, genetic and epigenetic regulation, which allows for a broader and deeper understanding of the principles of oncogenesis, as well as maintaining the viability of cancer cells in the mammary gland. Specific pathways of the activation of oxidative stress have been studied as a response to the overproduction of stress hormones and estrogens, and specific ways to reduce its negative impact have been described. The diversity of participants that trigger redox reactions from different sides is considered more fully: glycolytic activity in breast cancer, and the nature of consumption of amino acids and metals. The role of metals in oxidative stress is discussed in detail. They can act as both co-factors and direct participants in oxidative stress, since they are either a trigger mechanism for lipid peroxidation or capable of activating signaling pathways that affect tumorigenesis. Special attention has been paid to the genetic and epigenetic regulation of breast tumors. A complex cascade of mechanisms of epigenetic regulation is explained, which made it possible to reconsider the existing opinion about the triggers and pathways for launching the oncological process, the survival of cancer cells and their ability to localize.",
Targeting Breast Cancer Stem Cells Using Naturally Occurring Phytoestrogens,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9224163,Review,"Breast cancer therapies have made significant strides in improving survival for patients over the past decades. However, recurrence and drug resistance continue to challenge long-term recurrence-free and overall survival rates. Mounting evidence supports the cancer stem cell model in which the existence of a small population of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) within the tumor enables these cells to evade conventional therapies and repopulate the tumor, giving rise to more aggressive, recurrent tumors. Thus, successful breast cancer therapy would need to target these BCSCs, as well the tumor bulk cells. Since the Women’s Health Initiative study reported an increased risk of breast cancer with the use of conventional hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women, many have turned their attention to phytoestrogens as a natural alternative. Phytoestrogens are plant compounds that share structural similarities with human estrogens and can bind to the estrogen receptors to alter the endocrine responses. Recent studies have found that phytoestrogens can also target BCSCs and have the potential to complement conventional therapy eradicating BCSCs. This review summarized the latest findings of different phytoestrogens and their effect on BCSCs, along with their mechanisms of action, including selective estrogen receptor binding and inhibition of molecular pathways used by BCSCs. The latest results of phytoestrogens in clinical trials are also discussed to further evaluate the use of phytoestrogen in the treatment and prevention of breast cancer.",

Halophilic Carotenoids and Breast Cancer: From Salt Marshes to Biomedicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8625793,Review,"Breast cancer is the leading cause of death among women worldwide. Over the years, oxidative stress has been linked to the onset and progression of cancer. In addition to the classical histological classification, breast carcinomas are classified into phenotypes according to hormone receptors (estrogen receptor—RE—/progesterone receptor—PR) and growth factor receptor (human epidermal growth factor receptor—HER2) expression. Luminal tumors (ER/PR-positive/HER2-negative) are present in older patients with a better outcome. However, patients with HER2-positive or triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) (ER/PR/HER2-negative) subtypes still represent highly aggressive behavior, metastasis, poor prognosis, and drug resistance. Therefore, new alternative therapies have become an urgent clinical need. In recent years, anticancer agents based on natural products have been receiving huge interest. In particular, carotenoids are natural compounds present in fruits and vegetables, but algae, bacteria, and archaea also produce them. The antioxidant properties of carotenoids have been studied during the last years due to their potential in preventing and treating multiple diseases, including cancer. Although the effect of carotenoids on breast cancer during in vitro and in vivo studies is promising, clinical trials are still inconclusive. The haloarchaeal carotenoid bacterioruberin holds great promise to the future of biomedicine due to its particular structure, and antioxidant activity. However, much work remains to be performed to draw firm conclusions. This review summarizes the current knowledge on pre-clinical and clinical analysis on the use of carotenoids as chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agents in breast cancer, highlighting the most recent results regarding the use of bacterioruberin from haloarchaea.",

STAT family of transcription factors in breast cancer: Pathogenesis and therapeutic opportunities and challenges,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9714692,Article,"Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and second-leading cause of cancer deaths in women. Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) promote metastasis and therapeutic resistance contributing to tumor relapse. Through activating genes important for BCSCs, transcription factors contribute to breast cancer metastasis and therapeutic resistance, including the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family of transcription factors. The STAT family consists of six major isoforms, STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5, and STAT6. Canonical STAT signaling is activated by the binding of an extracellular ligand to a cell-surface receptor followed by STAT phosphorylation, leading to STAT nuclear translocation and transactivation of target genes. It is important to note that STAT transcription factors exhibit diverse effects in breast cancer; some are either pro- or anti-tumorigenic while others maintain dual, context-dependent roles. Among the STAT transcription factors, STAT3 is the most widely studied STAT protein in breast cancer for its critical roles in promoting BCSCs, breast cancer cell proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, metastasis, and immune evasion. Consequently, there have been substantial efforts in developing cancer therapeutics to target breast cancer with dysregulated STAT3 signaling. In this comprehensive review, we will summarize the diverse roles that each STAT family member plays in breast cancer pathobiology, as well as, the opportunities and challenges in pharmacologically targeting STAT proteins and their upstream activators in the context of breast cancer treatment.",
Breast Cancer Survivorship: A Comprehensive Review of Long-Term Medical Issues and Lifestyle Recommendations,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4403581,Original Research & Contributions,"As breast cancer becomes a chronic condition rather than a life-threatening illness, survivors not only have the challenge of dealing with multiple long-term side effects of treatment protocols, but may also be forced to address the preexisting comorbidities of their therapies, which often include multiple other issues. It is imperative that the information available regarding survivorship issues be accessible in an organized and useful format. This article is a modest attempt to provide a comprehensive review of the long-term medical issues.",
Metformin and Breast Cancer: Where Are We Now?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8910543,Review,"Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related death among women worldwide. Type 2 diabetes–associated metabolic traits such as hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, inflammation, oxidative stress, and obesity are well-known risk factors for breast cancer. The insulin sensitizer metformin, one of the most prescribed oral antidiabetic drugs, has been suggested to function as an antitumoral agent, based on epidemiological and retrospective clinical data as well as preclinical studies showing an antiproliferative effect in cultured breast cancer cells and animal models. These benefits provided a strong rationale to study the effects of metformin in routine clinical care of breast cancer patients. However, the initial enthusiasm was tempered after disappointing results in randomized controlled trials, particularly in the metastatic setting. Here, we revisit the current state of the art of metformin mechanisms of action, critically review past and current metformin-based clinical trials, and briefly discuss future perspectives on how to incorporate metformin into the oncologist’s armamentarium for the prevention and treatment of breast cancer.",

High density lipoproteins and oxidative stress in breast cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8543840,Review,"Breast cancer is one of the main leading causes of women death. In recent years, attention has been focused on the role of lipoproteins, alterations of cholesterol metabolism and oxidative stress in the molecular mechanism of breast cancer. A role for high density lipoproteins (HDL) has been proposed, in fact, in addition to the role of reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), HDL exert antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, modulate intracellular cholesterol homeostasis, signal transduction and proliferation. Low levels of HDL-Cholesterol (HDL-C) have been demonstrated in patients affected by breast cancer and it has been suggested that low levels of HDL-C could represent a risk factor of breast cancer. Contrasting results have been observed by other authors. Recent studies have demonstrated alterations of the activity of some enzymes associated to HDL surface such as Paraoxonase (PON1), Lecithin-Cholesterol Acyltransferase (LCAT) and Phospholipase A2 (PLA2). Higher levels of markers of lipid peroxidation in plasma or serum of patients have also been observed and suggest dysfunctional HDL in breast cancer patients. The review summarizes results on levels of markers of oxidative stress of plasma lipids and on alterations of enzymes associated to HDL in patients affected by breast cancer. The effects of normal and dysfunctional HDL on human breast cancer cells and molecular mechanisms potentially involved will be also reviewed.",
Visualization of breast cancer-related protein synthesis from the perspective of bibliometric analysis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10605986,Research,"Breast cancer, as a daunting global health threat, has driven an exponential growth in related research activity in recent decades. An area of research of paramount importance is protein synthesis, and the analysis of specific proteins inextricably linked to breast cancer. In this article, we undertake a bibliometric analysis of the literature on breast cancer and protein synthesis, aiming to provide crucial insights into this esoteric realm of investigation. Our approach was to scour the Web of Science database, between 2003 and 2022, for articles containing the keywords “breast cancer” and “protein synthesis” in their title, abstract, or keywords. We deployed bibliometric analysis software, exploring a range of measures such as publication output, citation counts, co-citation analysis, and keyword analysis. Our search yielded 2998 articles that met our inclusion criteria. The number of publications in this area has steadily increased, with a significant rise observed after 2003. Most of the articles were published in oncology or biology-related journals, with the most publications in Journal of Biological Chemistry, Cancer Research, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, and Oncogene. Keyword analysis revealed that “breast cancer,” “expression,” “cancer,” “protein,” and “translation” were the most commonly researched topics. In conclusion, our bibliometric analysis of breast cancer and related protein synthesis literature underscores the burgeoning interest in this research. The focus of the research is primarily on the relationship between protein expression in breast cancer and the development and treatment of tumors. These studies have been instrumental in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. Sustained research in this area will yield essential insights into the biology of breast cancer and the genesis of cutting-edge therapies.",
Involvement of NRF2 in Breast Cancer and Possible Therapeutical Role of Polyphenols and Melatonin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8038098,Review,"Oxidative stress is defined as a disturbance in the prooxidant/antioxidant balance in favor of the former and a loss of control over redox signaling processes, leading to potential biomolecular damage. It is involved in the etiology of many diseases, varying from diabetes to neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) is a transcription factor and reported as one of the most important oxidative stress regulators. Due to its regulatory role in the expression of numerous cytoprotective genes involved in the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory responses, the modulation of NRF2 seems to be a promising approach in the prevention and treatment of cancer. Breast cancer is the prevalent type of tumor in women and is the leading cause of death among female cancers. Oxidative stress-related mechanisms are known to be involved in breast cancer, and therefore, NRF2 is considered to be beneficial in its prevention. However, its overactivation may lead to a negative clinical impact on breast cancer therapy by causing chemoresistance. Some known “oxidative stress modulators”, such as melatonin and polyphenols, are suggested to play an important role in the prevention and treatment of cancer, where the activation of NRF2 is reported as a possible underlying mechanism. In the present review, the potential involvement of oxidative stress and NRF2 in breast cancer will be reviewed, and the role of the NRF2 modulators—namely, polyphenols and melatonin—in the treatment of breast cancer will be discussed.",

Spotlight on Exosomal Non-Coding RNAs in Breast Cancer: An In Silico Analysis to Identify Potential lncRNA/circRNA-miRNA-Target Axis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9369058,Review,"Breast cancer (BC) has recently become the most common cancer type worldwide, with metastatic disease being the main reason for disease mortality. This has brought about strategies for early detection, especially the utilization of minimally invasive biomarkers found in various bodily fluids. Exosomes have been proposed as novel extracellular vesicles, readily detectable in bodily fluids, secreted from BC-cells or BC-tumor microenvironment cells, and capable of conferring cellular signals over long distances via various cargo molecules. This cargo is composed of different biomolecules, among which are the novel non-coding genome products, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and the recently discovered circular RNA (circRNA), all of which were found to be implicated in BC pathology. In this review, the diverse roles of the ncRNA cargo of BC-derived exosomes will be discussed, shedding light on their primarily oncogenic and additionally tumor suppressor roles at different levels of BC tumor progression, and drug sensitivity/resistance, along with presenting their diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarker potential. Finally, benefiting from the miRNA sponging mechanism of action of lncRNAs and circRNAs, we established an experimentally validated breast cancer exosomal non-coding RNAs-regulated target gene axis from already published exosomal ncRNAs in BC. The resulting genes, pathways, gene ontology (GO) terms, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis could be a starting point to better understand BC and may pave the way for the development of novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and therapeutics.",
Mammary stem cells and progenitors: targeting the roots of breast cancer for prevention,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6627238,Review,"Breast cancer prevention is daunting, yet not an unsurmountable goal. Mammary stem and progenitors have been proposed as the cells‐of‐origin in breast cancer. Here, we present the concept of limiting these breast cancer precursors as a risk reduction approach in high‐risk women. A wealth of information now exists for phenotypic and functional characterization of mammary stem and progenitor cells in mouse and human. Recent work has also revealed the hormonal regulation of stem/progenitor dynamics as well as intrinsic lineage distinctions between mammary epithelial populations. Leveraging these insights, molecular marker‐guided chemoprevention is an achievable reality.",

Unconventional protein post-translational modifications: the helmsmen in breast cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8881842,Review,"Breast cancer is the most prevalent malignant tumor and a leading cause of mortality among females worldwide. The tumorigenesis and progression of breast cancer involve complex pathophysiological processes, which may be mediated by post-translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins, stimulated by various genes and signaling pathways. Studies into PTMs have long been dominated by the investigation of protein phosphorylation and histone epigenetic modifications. However, with great advances in proteomic techniques, several other PTMs, such as acetylation, glycosylation, sumoylation, methylation, ubiquitination, citrullination, and palmitoylation have been confirmed in breast cancer. Nevertheless, the mechanisms, effects, and inhibitors of these unconventional PTMs (particularly, the non-histone modifications other than phosphorylation) received comparatively little attention. Therefore, in this review, we illustrate the functions of these PTMs and highlight their impact on the oncogenesis and progression of breast cancer. Identification of novel potential therapeutic drugs targeting PTMs and development of biological markers for the detection of breast cancer would be significantly valuable for the efficient selection of therapeutic regimens and prediction of disease prognosis in patients with breast cancer.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8881842/bin/13578_2022_756_MOESM1_ESM.docx
Targeting Breast Cancer Stem Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9830502,Review,"The potential roles of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) in tumor initiation and recurrence have been recognized for many decades. Due to their strong capacity for self-renewal and differentiation, BCSCs are the major reasons for poor clinical outcomes and low therapeutic response. Several hypotheses on the origin of cancer stem cells have been proposed, including critical gene mutations in stem cells, dedifferentiation of somatic cells, and cell plasticity remodeling by epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, the tumor microenvironment, including cellular components and cytokines, modulates the self-renewal and therapeutic resistance of BCSCs. Small molecules, antibodies, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells targeting BCSCs have been developed, and their applications in combination with conventional therapies are undergoing clinical trials. In this review, we focus on the features of BCSCs, emphasize the major factors and tumor environment that regulate the stemness of BCSCs, and discuss potential BCSC-targeting therapies.",
Applications of Circulating Tumor Cells and Circulating Tumor DNA in Precision Oncology for Breast Cancers,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9315812,Review,"Liquid biopsies allow for the detection of cancer biomarkers such as circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Elevated levels of these biomarkers during cancer treatment could potentially serve as indicators of cancer progression and shed light on the mechanisms of metastasis and therapy resistance. Thus, liquid biopsies serve as tools for cancer detection and monitoring through a simple, non-invasive blood draw, allowing multiple longitudinal sampling. These circulating markers have significant prospects for use in assessing patients’ prognosis, monitoring response to therapy, and developing precision medicine. In addition, single-cell omics of these liquid biopsy markers can be potential tools for identifying tumor heterogeneity and plasticity as well as novel therapeutic targets. In this review, we focus on our current understanding of circulating tumor biomarkers, especially in breast cancer, and the scope of novel sequencing technologies and diagnostic methods for better prognostication and patient stratification to improve patient outcomes.",

Cancer‐associated fibroblasts in breast cancer: Challenges and opportunities,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9118050,Review,"The tumor microenvironment is proposed to contribute substantially to the progression of cancers, including breast cancer. Cancer‐associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the most abundant components of the tumor microenvironment. Studies have revealed that CAFs in breast cancer originate from several types of cells and promote breast cancer malignancy by secreting factors, generating exosomes, releasing nutrients, reshaping the extracellular matrix, and suppressing the function of immune cells. CAFs are also becoming therapeutic targets for breast cancer due to their specific distribution in tumors and their unique biomarkers. Agents interrupting the effect of CAFs on surrounding cells have been developed and applied in clinical trials. Here, we reviewed studies examining the heterogeneity of CAFs in breast cancer and expression patterns of CAF markers in different subtypes of breast cancer. We hope that summarizing CAF‐related studies from a historical perspective will help to accelerate the development of CAF‐targeted therapeutic strategies for breast cancer.",
Targeting HMGB1: An available Therapeutic Strategy for Breast Cancer Therapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9134916,Review,"HMGB1 is a member of highly conserved high mobility group protein superfamily with intracellular and extracellular distribution. Abnormal HMGB1 levels are frequently manifested in various malignant diseases, including breast cancer. Numerous studies have revealed the clinical value of HMGB1 in the diagnosis and therapy of breast cancer. However, the dual function of pro- and anti-tumor makes HMGB1 in cancer progression requires more profound understanding. This review summarizes the functions and mechanisms of HMGB1 on regulating breast cancer, including autophagy, immunogenic cell death, and interaction with the tumor microenvironment. These functions determine the strategies for the development of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy and combination therapies by targeting HMGB1 in breast cancer. Defining the mechanisms of HMGB1 on regulating breast cancer development and progression will facilitate the application of HMGB1 as a therapeutic target for breast cancer.",
Prolactin and endocrine therapy resistance in breast cancer: The next potential hope for breast cancer treatment,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8581311,Review,"Breast cancer, a hormone‐dependent tumour, generally includes four molecular subtypes (luminal A, luminal B, HER2 enriched and triple‐negative) based on oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor‐2. Multiple hormones in the body regulate the development of breast cancer. Endocrine therapy is one of the primary treatments for hormone‐receptor‐positive breast cancer, but endocrine resistance is the primary clinical cause of treatment failure. Prolactin (PRL) is a protein hormone secreted by the pituitary gland, mainly promoting mammary gland growth, stimulating and maintaining lactation. Previous studies suggest that high PRL levels can increase the risk of invasive breast cancer in women.

Vitamin D as a Potential Preventive Agent For Young Women's Breast Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8937000,Review,"Clinical studies backed by research in animal models suggest that vitamin D may protect against the development of breast cancer, implicating vitamin D as a promising candidate for breast cancer prevention. However, despite clear preclinical evidence showing protective roles for vitamin D, broadly targeted clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation have yielded conflicting findings, highlighting the complexity of translating preclinical data to efficacy in humans. While vitamin D supplementation targeted to high-risk populations is a strategy anticipated to increase prevention efficacy, a complimentary approach is to target transient, developmental windows of elevated breast cancer risk. Postpartum mammary gland involution represents a developmental window of increased breast cancer promotion that may be poised for vitamin D supplementation. Targeting the window of involution with short-term vitamin D intervention may offer a simple, cost-effective approach for the prevention of breast cancers that develop postpartum. In this review, we highlight epidemiologic and preclinical studies linking vitamin D deficiency with breast cancer development. We discuss the underlying mechanisms through which vitamin D deficiency contributes to cancer development, with an emphasis on the anti-inflammatory activity of vitamin D. We also discuss current evidence for vitamin D as an immunotherapeutic agent and the potential for vitamin D as a preventative strategy for young woman's breast cancer.",
STAT1 potentiates oxidative stress revealing a targetable vulnerability that increases phenformin efficacy in breast cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8175605,Article,"Bioenergetic perturbations driving neoplastic growth increase the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), requiring a compensatory increase in ROS scavengers to limit oxidative stress. Intervention strategies that simultaneously induce energetic and oxidative stress therefore have therapeutic potential. Phenformin is a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor that induces bioenergetic stress. We now demonstrate that inflammatory mediators, including IFNγ and polyIC, potentiate the cytotoxicity of phenformin by inducing a parallel increase in oxidative stress through STAT1-dependent mechanisms. Indeed, STAT1 signaling downregulates NQO1, a key ROS scavenger, in many breast cancer models. Moreover, genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of NQO1 using β-lapachone (an NQO1 bioactivatable drug) increases oxidative stress to selectively sensitize breast cancer models, including patient derived xenografts of HER2+ and triple negative disease, to the tumoricidal effects of phenformin.

Currently, seven mammalian homologs of yeast Sir2 named SIRT1 to SIRT7 have been identified. Increasing evidence has suggested the vital roles of seven members of the SIRT family in health and disease conditions. Notably, this protein family plays a variety of important roles in cellular biology such as inflammation, metabolism, oxidative stress, and apoptosis, etc., thus, it is considered a potential therapeutic target for different kinds of pathologies including cancer, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and other conditions. Moreover, identification of SIRT modulators and exploring the functions of these different modulators have prompted increased efforts to discover new small molecules, which can modify SIRT activity. Furthermore, several randomized controlled trials have indicated that different interventions might affect the expression of SIRT protein in human samples, and supplementation of SIRT modulators might have diverse impact on physiological function in different participants. In this review, we introduce the history and structure of the SIRT protein family, discuss the molecular mechanisms and biological functions of seven members of the SIRT protein family, elaborate on the regulatory roles of SIRTs in human disease, summarize SIRT inhibitors and activators, and review related clinical studies.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9797940/bin/41392_2022_1257_MOESM1_ESM.docx

A novel ferroptosis-related gene signature for overall survival prediction and immune infiltration in patients with breast cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9591322,Articles,"Breast cancer is the most prevalent type of cancer among women worldwide. The heterogeneous nature of breast cancer poses a serious challenge for prognostic prediction and individualized therapies. Recently, ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of programmed cell death, has been reported to serve a significant role in the regulation of the biological behavior of tumors. Several studies have revealed the prognostic significance of the ferroptosis-related gene (FRG) model; however, additional efforts are required to elucidate the details. Moreover, genes that modulate ferroptosis may be promising candidate bioindicators in cancer therapy. The present study systematically assessed the expression profiles of FRGs to reveal the relationship between FRGs and the prognostic features of patients with breast cancer based on data obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus and Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium. Using a non-negative matrix factorization clustering method, patients with breast cancer were classified into two sub-groups (cluster 1 and cluster 2) based on the expression of FRGs. Furthermore, Cox regression, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator methods were used to construct a risk score formula comprised of nine genes, which stratified patients with breast cancer into two risk groups. Patients belonging to the high-risk group exhibited significantly shorter overall survival (OS) time compared with patients in the low-risk group. The prognostic value of this signature was further verified in the training and validation cohorts. The results for univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses indicated that risk score acted as an independent predictor for OS. Subsequently, a nomogram was constructed. Receiver operating characteristic analysis further confirmed that the resulting nomogram exhibited powerful discriminatory ability. Functional analysis revealed that the immune environment differed notably between the two groups and indicated an association between ferroptosis and breast cancer proliferation, migration and drug resistance. Taken together, the present study demonstrated that FRGs were significantly associated with breast cancer progression, and thus could be used as novel biomarkers for prognostic prediction and individualized treatment of patients with breast cancer.",

Dietary phytochemicals in breast cancer research: anticancer effects and potential utility for effective chemoprevention,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6085646,Review Article,"Cancerous tissue transformation developing usually over years or even decades of life is a highly complex process involving strong stressors damaging DNA, chronic inflammation, comprehensive interaction between relevant molecular pathways, and cellular cross-talk within the neighboring tissues. Only the minor part of all cancer cases are caused by inborn predisposition; the absolute majority carry a sporadic character based on modifiable risk factors which play a central role in cancer prevention. Amongst most promising candidates for dietary supplements are bioactive phytochemicals demonstrating strong anticancer effects. Abundant evidence has been collected for beneficial effects of flavonoids, carotenoids, phenolic acids, and organosulfur compounds affecting a number of cancer-related pathways. Phytochemicals may positively affect processes of cell signaling, cell cycle regulation, oxidative stress response, and inflammation. They can modulate non-coding RNAs, upregulate tumor suppressive miRNAs, and downregulate oncogenic miRNAs that synergically inhibits cancer cell growth and cancer stem cell self-renewal.

Obesity and endocrine therapy resistance in breast cancer: Mechanistic insights and perspectives,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9285685,Obesity Comorbidity/Etiology and Pathophysiology,"The incidence of obesity, a recognized risk factor for various metabolic and chronic diseases, including numerous types of cancers, has risen dramatically over the recent decades worldwide. To date, convincing research in this area has painted a complex picture about the adverse impact of high body adiposity on breast cancer onset and progression. However, an emerging but overlooked issue of clinical significance is the limited efficacy of the conventional endocrine therapies with selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) or degraders (SERDs) and aromatase inhibitors (AIs) in patients affected by breast cancer and obesity. The mechanisms behind the interplay between obesity and endocrine therapy resistance are likely to be multifactorial. Therefore, what have we actually learned during these years and which are the main challenges in the field? In this review, we will critically discuss the epidemiological evidence linking obesity to endocrine therapeutic responses and we will outline the molecular players involved in this harmful connection. Given the escalating global epidemic of obesity, advances in understanding this critical node will offer new precision medicine‐based therapeutic interventions and more appropriate dosing schedule for treating patients affected by obesity and with breast tumors resistant to endocrine therapies.",
"Crosstalk between Notch, HIF-1α and GPER in Breast Cancer EMT",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6073901,Review,"The Notch signaling pathway acts in both physiological and pathological conditions, including embryonic development and tumorigenesis. In cancer progression, diverse mechanisms are involved in Notch-mediated biological responses, including angiogenesis and epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT). During EMT, the activation of cellular programs facilitated by transcriptional repressors results in epithelial cells losing their differentiated features, like cell–cell adhesion and apical–basal polarity, whereas they gain motility. As it concerns cancer epithelial cells, EMT may be consequent to the evolution of genetic/epigenetic instability, or triggered by factors that can act within the tumor microenvironment. Following a description of the Notch signaling pathway and its major regulatory nodes, we focus on studies that have given insights into the functional interaction between Notch signaling and either hypoxia or estrogen in breast cancer cells, with a particular focus on EMT. Furthermore, we describe the role of hypoxia signaling in breast cancer cells and discuss recent evidence regarding a functional interaction between HIF-1α and GPER in both breast cancer cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). On the basis of these studies, we propose that a functional network between HIF-1α, GPER and Notch may integrate tumor microenvironmental cues to induce robust EMT in cancer cells. Further investigations are required in order to better understand how hypoxia and estrogen signaling may converge on Notch-mediated EMT within the context of the stroma and tumor cells interaction. However, the data discussed here may anticipate the potential benefits of further pharmacological strategies targeting breast cancer progression.",

Aryl hydrocarbon receptor: An emerging player in breast cancer pathogenesis and its potential as a drug target (Review),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10704547,Review,"Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women. Metastatic breast cancer is incurable and is a major cause of shortened patient survival. The different molecular types of breast cancer make targeted therapy difficult and a complex challenge. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is an evolutionarily conserved transcription factor that has been implicated in the metabolism of xenobiotic ligands. AhR is activated by numerous exogenous and endogenous ligands and participates in multiple physiological processes, including proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis. AhR expression is upregulated in certain breast cancer subtypes, including estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, and has been implicated in the development and progression of breast cancer. Over the last two decades, AhR and its ligands have emerged as novel biological targets for the treatment of breast cancer. Both AhR agonists and antagonists may be effective in inhibiting critical activities of breast cancer. The present review evaluates the role and underlying mechanisms of AhR and its ligands in breast cancer and demonstrates the potential of exploiting AhR as a novel target for breast cancer therapy.",
MicroRNA and Oxidative Stress Interplay in the Context of Breast Cancer Pathogenesis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6829356,Review,"Oxidative stress is a pathological condition determined by a disturbance in reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis. Depending on the entity of the perturbation, normal cells can either restore equilibrium or activate pathways of cell death. On the contrary, cancer cells exploit this phenomenon to sustain a proliferative and aggressive phenotype. In fact, ROS overproduction or their reduced disposal influence all hallmarks of cancer, from genome instability to cell metabolism, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis. A persistent state of oxidative stress can even initiate tumorigenesis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non coding RNAs with regulatory functions, which expression has been extensively proven to be dysregulated in cancer. Intuitively, miRNA transcription and biogenesis are affected by the oxidative status of the cell and, in some instances, they participate in defining it. Indeed, it is widely reported the role of miRNAs in regulating numerous factors involved in the ROS signaling pathways. Given that miRNA function and modulation relies on cell type or tumor, in order to delineate a clearer and more exhaustive picture, in this review we present a comprehensive overview of the literature concerning how miRNAs and ROS signaling interplay affects breast cancer progression.",

PEAK1 (Pseudopodium-Enriched Atypical Kinase One) is an actin cytoskeleton- and focal adhesion-associated pseudokinase that promotes cell state plasticity and cancer metastasis by mediating growth factor-integrin signaling crosstalk. Here, we determined that stromal PEAK1 expression predicts poor outcomes in HER2-positive breast cancers high in SNAI2 expression and enriched for MSC content. Specifically, we identified that the fibroblastic stroma in HER2-positive breast cancer patient tissue stains positive for both nuclear SNAI2 and cytoplasmic PEAK1. Furthermore, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) express high PEAK1 protein levels and potentiate tumorigenesis, lapatinib resistance and metastasis of HER2-positive breast cancer cells in a PEAK1-dependent manner. Analysis of PEAK1-dependent secreted factors from MSCs revealed INHBA/activin-A as a necessary factor in the conditioned media of PEAK1-expressing MSCs that promotes lapatinib resistance.

Drug Resistance in Metastatic Breast Cancer: Tumor Targeted Nanomedicine to the Rescue,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8125767,Review,"Breast cancer, specifically metastatic breast, is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in women. This is mainly due to relapse and reoccurrence of tumor. The primary reason for cancer relapse is the development of multidrug resistance (MDR) hampering the treatment and prognosis. MDR can occur due to a multitude of molecular events, including increased expression of efflux transporters such as P-gp, BCRP, or MRP1; epithelial to mesenchymal transition; and resistance development in breast cancer stem cells. Excessive dose dumping in chemotherapy can cause intrinsic anti-cancer MDR to appear prior to chemotherapy and after the treatment. Hence, novel targeted nanomedicines encapsulating chemotherapeutics and gene therapy products may assist to overcome cancer drug resistance. Targeted nanomedicines offer innovative strategies to overcome the limitations of conventional chemotherapy while permitting enhanced selectivity to cancer cells. Targeted nanotheranostics permit targeted drug release, precise breast cancer diagnosis, and importantly, the ability to overcome MDR. The article discusses various nanomedicines designed to selectively target breast cancer, triple negative breast cancer, and breast cancer stem cells. In addition, the review discusses recent approaches, including combination nanoparticles (NPs), theranostic NPs, and stimuli sensitive or “smart” NPs. Recent innovations in microRNA NPs and personalized medicine NPs are also discussed.

Novel Anti-Cancer Products Targeting AMPK: Natural Herbal Medicine against Breast Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9863744,Review,"Breast cancer is a common cancer in women worldwide. The existing clinical treatment strategies have been able to limit the progression of breast cancer and cancer metastasis, but abnormal metabolism, immunosuppression, and multidrug resistance involving multiple regulators remain the major challenges for the treatment of breast cancer. Adenosine 5′-monophosphate (AMP)-Activated Protein Kinase (AMPK) can regulate metabolic reprogramming and reverse the “Warburg effect” via multiple metabolic signaling pathways in breast cancer. Previous studies suggest that the activation of AMPK suppresses the growth and metastasis of breast cancer cells, as well as stimulating the responses of immune cells. However, some other reports claim that the development and poor prognosis of breast cancer are related to the overexpression and aberrant activation of AMPK. Thus, the role of AMPK in the progression of breast cancer is still controversial. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of AMPK, particularly the comprehensive bidirectional functions of AMPK in cancer progression; discuss the pharmacological activators of AMPK and some specific molecules, including the natural products (including berberine, curcumin, (−)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate, ginsenosides, and paclitaxel) that influence the efficacy of these activators in cancer therapy; and elaborate the role of AMPK as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of breast cancer.",

Role of dietary bioactive natural products in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5033666,Article,"Estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer, including luminal-A and -B, is the most common type of breast cancer. Extended exposure to estrogen is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. Both ER-dependent and ER-independent mechanisms have been implicated in estrogen-mediated carcinogenesis. The ER-dependent pathway involves cell growth and proliferation triggered by the binding of estrogen to the ER. The ER-independent mechanisms depend on the metabolism of estrogen to generate genotoxic metabolites, free radicals and reactive oxygen species to induce breast cancer. A better understanding of the mechanisms that drive ER-positive breast cancer will help optimize targeted approaches to prevent or treat breast cancer. A growing emphasis is being placed on alternative medicine and dietary approaches toward the prevention and treatment of breast cancer. Many natural products and bioactive compounds found in foods have been shown to inhibit breast carcinogenesis via inhibition of estrogen induced oxidative stress as well as ER signaling.

Cellular Mechanisms of Circulating Tumor Cells During Breast Cancer Metastasis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7404335,Review,"Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are cancer cells that detach from the primary site and travel in the blood stream. A higher number of CTCs increases the risk of breast cancer metastasis, and it is inversely associated with the survival rates of patients with breast cancer. Although the numbers of CTCs are generally low and the majority of CTCs die in circulation, the survival of a few CTCs can seed the development of a tumor at a secondary location. An increasing number of studies demonstrate that CTCs undergo modification in response to the dynamic biophysical environment in the blood due in part to fluid shear stress. Fluid shear stress generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), triggers redox-sensitive cell signaling, and alters the function of intracellular organelles. In particular, the mitochondrion is an important target organelle in determining the metastatic phenotype of CTCs. In healthy cells, mitochondria produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) via oxidative phosphorylation in the electron transport chain, and during oxidative phosphorylation, they produce physiological levels of ROS. Mitochondria also govern death mechanisms such as apoptosis and mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening to, in order eliminate unwanted or damaged cells. However, in cancer cells, mitochondria are dysregulated, causing aberrant energy metabolism, redox homeostasis, and cell death pathways that may favor cancer invasiveness. In this review, we discuss the influence of fluid shear stress on CTCs with an emphasis on breast cancer pathology, then discuss alterations of cellular mechanisms that may increase the metastatic potentials of CTCs.",
The innate and adaptive infiltrating immune systems as targets for breast cancer immunotherapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5425956,Review,"A cancer cell-centric view has long dominated the field of cancer biology. Research efforts have focussed on aberrant cancer cell signalling pathways and on changes to cancer cell DNA. Mounting evidence demonstrates that many cancer-associated cell types within the tumour stroma co-evolve and support tumour growth and development, greatly modifying cancer cell behaviour, facilitating invasion and metastasis and controlling dormancy and sensitivity to drug therapy. Thus, these stromal cells represent potential targets for cancer therapy. Among these cell types, immune cells have emerged as a promising target for therapy. The adaptive and the innate immune system play an important role in normal mammary development and breast cancer. The number of infiltrating adaptive immune system cells with tumour-rejecting capacity, primarily, T lymphocytes, is lower in breast cancer compared with other cancer types, but infiltration occurs in a large proportion of cases. There is strong evidence demonstrating the importance of the immunosuppressive role of the innate immune system during breast cancer progression. A consideration of components of both the innate and the adaptive immune system is essential for the design and development of immunotherapies in breast cancer. In this review, we focus on the importance of immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) as potential targets for breast cancer therapy.",
Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Ligand 5F 203 Induces Oxidative Stress That Triggers DNA Damage in Human Breast Cancer Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4662255,Article,"Breast tumors often show profound sensitivity to exogenous oxidative stress. Investigational agent 2-(4-amino-3-methylphenyl)-5-fluorobenzothiazole (5F 203) induces aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-mediated DNA damage in certain breast cancer cells.

New Advances in the Research of Resistance to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8431789,Review,"Breast cancer has an extremely high incidence in women, and its morbidity and mortality rank first among female tumors. With the increasing development of medicine today, the clinical application of neoadjuvant chemotherapy has brought new hope to the treatment of breast cancer. Although the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been confirmed, drug resistance is one of the main reasons for its treatment failure, contributing to the difficulty in the treatment of breast cancer. This article focuses on multiple mechanisms of action and expounds a series of recent research advances that mediate drug resistance in breast cancer cells. Drug metabolizing enzymes can mediate a catalytic reaction to inactivate chemotherapeutic drugs and develop drug resistance. The drug efflux system can reduce the drug concentration in breast cancer cells. The combination of glutathione detoxification system and platinum drugs can cause breast cancer cells to be insensitive to drugs. Changes in drug targets have led to poorer efficacy of HER2 receptor inhibitors. Moreover, autophagy, epithelial–mesenchymal transition, and tumor microenvironment can all contribute to the development of resistance in breast cancer cells. Based on the relevant research on the existing drug resistance mechanism, the current treatment plan for reversing the resistance of breast cancer to neoadjuvant chemotherapy is explored, and the potential drug targets are analyzed, aiming to provide a new idea and strategy to reverse the resistance of neoadjuvant chemotherapy drugs in breast cancer.",
Influence of Olive Oil and Its Components on Breast Cancer: Molecular Mechanisms,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8780060,Review,"Breast cancer is the most frequent malignant neoplasia and a leading cause of mortality in women worldwide. The Mediterranean diet has been proposed as a healthy dietary pattern with protective effects in several chronic diseases, including breast cancer. This diet is characterized by the consumption of abundant plant foods and olive oil as the principal source of fat, which is considered one of the main components with potential antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects. Extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) has several bioactive compounds, mainly including monounsaturated fatty acids, triterpenes and polyphenols, such as phenolic alcohols (e.g., hydroxytyrosol), secoiridoids (e.g., oleuropein and oleocanthal), lignans (e.g., pinoresinol) or flavonoids (e.g., luteolin). While epidemiological evidence is still limited, experimental in vivo and in vitro data have shown a protective effect of this oil and its compounds on mammary carcinogenesis. Such effects account through complex and multiple mechanisms, including changes in epigenetics, transcriptome and protein expression that modulate several signaling pathways. Molecular targets of EVOO compounds have a role in the acquisition of cancer hallmarks. Although further research is needed to elucidate their beneficial effects on human prevention and progression of the disease, evidence points to EVOO in the context of the Mediterranean diet as a heathy choice, while EVOO components may be promising adjuvants in anticancer strategies.",
BRCA1 mutations drive oxidative stress and glycolysis in the tumor microenvironment,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3552923,Report,"Mutations in the BRCA1 tumor suppressor gene are commonly found in hereditary breast cancer. Similarly, downregulation of BRCA1 protein expression is observed in the majority of basal-like breast cancers. Here, we set out to study the effects of BRCA1 mutations on oxidative stress in the tumor microenvironment. To mimic the breast tumor microenvironment, we utilized an in vitro co-culture model of human BRCA1-mutated HCC1937 breast cancer cells and hTERT-immortalized human fibroblasts. Notably, HCC1937 cells induce the generation of hydrogen peroxide in the fibroblast compartment during co-culture, which can be inhibited by genetic complementation with the wild-type BRCA1 gene. Importantly, treatment with powerful antioxidants, such as NAC and Tempol, induces apoptosis in HCC1937 cells, suggesting that microenvironmental oxidative stress supports cancer cell survival. In addition, Tempol treatment increases the apoptotic rates of MDA-MB-231 cells, which have wild-type BRCA1, but share a basal-like breast cancer phenotype with HCC1937 cells. MCT4 is the main exporter of L-lactate out of cells and is a marker for oxidative stress and glycolytic metabolism. Co-culture with HCC1937 cells dramatically induces MCT4 protein expression in fibroblasts, and this can be prevented by either BRCA1 overexpression or by pharmacological treatment with NAC. We next evaluated caveolin-1 (Cav-1) expression in stromal fibroblasts. Loss of Cav-1 is a marker of the cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) phenotype, which is linked to high stromal glycolysis, and is associated with a poor prognosis in numerous types of human cancers, including breast cancers. Remarkably, HCC1937 cells induce a loss of Cav-1 in adjacent stromal cells during co-culture. Conversely, Cav-1 expression in fibroblasts can be rescued by administration of NAC or by overexpression of BRCA1 in HCC1937 cells. Notably, BRCA1-deficient human breast cancer samples (9 out of 10) also showed a glycolytic stromal phenotype, with intense mitochondrial staining specifically in BRCA1-deficient breast cancer cells. In summary, loss of BRCA1 function leads to hydrogen peroxide generation in both epithelial breast cancer cells and neighboring stromal fibroblasts, and promotes the onset of a reactive glycolytic stroma, with increased MCT4 and decreased Cav-1 expression. Importantly, these metabolic changes can be reversed by antioxidants, which potently induce cancer cell death. Thus, antioxidant therapy appears to be synthetically lethal with a BRCA1-deficiency in breast cancer cells and should be considered for future cancer prevention trials.

In the case of breast tissue, abnormal mammary gland development can lead to dysfunction in milk secretion, a primary function, as well as the onset of various diseases, such as breast cancer. In the process of aging, the terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs) within the breast undergo gradual degeneration, while the proportion of adipose tissue in the breast continues to increase and hormonal levels in the breast change accordingly. Here, we review changes in morphology, internal structure, and cellular composition that occur in the mammary gland during aging. We also explore the emerging mechanisms of breast aging and the relationship between changes during aging and breast-related diseases, as well as potential interventions for delaying mammary gland aging and preventing breast disease.",
"Microbiome—Microbial Metabolome—Cancer Cell Interactions in Breast Cancer—Familiar, but Unexplored",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6523810,Review,"Breast cancer is a leading cause of death among women worldwide. Dysbiosis, an aberrant composition of the microbiome, characterizes breast cancer. In this review we discuss the changes to the metabolism of breast cancer cells, as well as the composition of the breast and gut microbiome in breast cancer. The role of the breast microbiome in breast cancer is unresolved, nevertheless it seems that the gut microbiome does have a role in the pathology of the disease. The gut microbiome secretes bioactive metabolites (reactivated estrogens, short chain fatty acids, amino acid metabolites, or secondary bile acids) that modulate breast cancer. We highlight the bacterial species or taxonomical units that generate these metabolites, we show their mode of action, and discuss how the metabolites affect mitochondrial metabolism and other molecular events in breast cancer. These metabolites resemble human hormones, as they are produced in a “gland” (in this case, the microbiome) and they are subsequently transferred to distant sites of action through the circulation. These metabolites appear to be important constituents of the tumor microenvironment. Finally, we discuss how bacterial dysbiosis interferes with breast cancer treatment through interfering with chemotherapeutic drug metabolism and availability.",

Breast cancer treatment is challenging due to complex nature of the etiology of disease. Cell division cycle alterations are often encountered in a variety of cancer types including breast cancer. Common treatments include chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy, and hormonal therapy; however, adverse effects and multidrug resistance lead to complications and noncompliance. Accordingly, there is an increasing demand for natural products from medicinal plants and foods. This review summarizes molecular mechanisms of signaling pathways in breast cancer and identifies mechanisms by which natural compounds may exert their efficacy in the treatment of breast cancer.",
Graphene-based nanomaterials for breast cancer treatment: promising therapeutic strategies,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8281664,Review,"Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women, and its incidence increases annually. Traditional therapies have several side effects, leading to the urgent need to explore new smart drug-delivery systems and find new therapeutic strategies. Graphene-based nanomaterials (GBNs) are potential drug carriers due to their target selectivity, easy functionalization, chemosensitization and high drug-loading capacity. Previous studies have revealed that GBNs play an important role in fighting breast cancer. Here, we have summarized the superior properties of GBNs and modifications to shape GBNs for improved function. Then, we focus on the applications of GBNs in breast cancer treatment, including drug delivery, gene therapy, phototherapy, and magnetothermal therapy (MTT), and as a platform to combine multiple therapies. Their advantages in enhancing therapeutic effects, reducing the toxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs, overcoming multidrug resistance (MDR) and inhibiting tumor metastasis are highlighted. This review aims to help evaluate GBNs as therapeutic strategies and provide additional novel ideas for their application in breast cancer therapy.",
"The gut microbiota in breast cancer development and treatment: The good, the bad, and the useful!",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10262790,Review Article,"Regardless of the global progress in early diagnosis and novel therapeutic regimens, breast carcinoma poses a devastating threat, and the advances are somewhat marred by high mortality rates. Breast cancer risk prediction models based on the known risk factors are extremely useful, but a large number of breast cancers develop in women with no/low known risk. The gut microbiome exerts a profound impact on the host health and physiology and has emerged as a pivotal frontier in breast cancer pathogenesis. Progress in metagenomic analysis has enabled the identification of specific changes in the host microbial signature. In this review, we discuss the microbial and metabolomic changes associated with breast cancer initiation and metastatic progression. We summarize the bidirectional impact of various breast cancer-related therapies on gut microbiota and vice-versa. Finally, we discuss the strategies to modulate the gut microbiota toward a more favorable state that confers anticancer effects.",
"Integrated Bioinformatics, Environmental Epidemiologic and Genomic Approaches to Identify Environmental and Molecular Links between Endometriosis and Breast Cancer",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4632802,Article,"We present a combined environmental epidemiologic, genomic, and bioinformatics approach to identify: exposure of environmental chemicals with estrogenic activity; epidemiologic association between endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) and health effects, such as, breast cancer or endometriosis; and gene-EDC interactions and disease associations. Human exposure measurement and modeling confirmed estrogenic activity of three selected class of environmental chemicals, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), bisphenols (BPs), and phthalates. Meta-analysis showed that PCBs exposure, not Bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates, increased the summary odds ratio for breast cancer and endometriosis. Bioinformatics analysis of gene-EDC interactions and disease associations identified several hundred genes that were altered by exposure to PCBs, phthalate or BPA. EDCs-modified genes in breast neoplasms and endometriosis are part of steroid hormone signaling and inflammation pathways. All three EDCs–PCB 153, phthalates, and BPA influenced five common genes—",
"Mitochondrial oxidative stress in cancer-associated fibroblasts drives lactate production, promoting breast cancer tumor growth",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3272288,Report,"Increasing chronological age is the most significant risk factor for cancer. Recently, we proposed a new paradigm for understanding the role of the aging and the tumor microenvironment in cancer onset. In this model, cancer cells induce oxidative stress in adjacent stromal fibroblasts. This, in turn, causes several changes in the phenotype of the fibroblast including mitochondrial dysfunction, hydrogen peroxide production and aerobic glycolysis, resulting in high levels of L-lactate production. L-lactate is then transferred from these glycolytic fibroblasts to adjacent epithelial cancer cells and used as “fuel” for oxidative mitochondrial metabolism. Here, we created a new pre-clinical model system to directly test this hypothesis experimentally. To synthetically generate glycolytic fibroblasts, we genetically-induced mitochondrial dysfunction by knocking down TFAM using an sh-RNA approach. TFAM is mitochondrial transcription factor A, which is important in functionally maintaining the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Interestingly, TFAM-deficient fibroblasts showed evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, with the loss of certain mitochondrial respiratory chain components, and the over-production of hydrogen peroxide and L-lactate. Thus, TFAM-deficient fibroblasts underwent metabolic reprogramming towards aerobic glycolysis. Most importantly, TFAM-deficient fibroblasts significantly promoted tumor growth, as assayed using a human breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) xenograft model. These increases in glycolytic fibroblast driven tumor growth were independent of tumor angiogenesis. Mechanistically, TFAM-deficient fibroblasts increased the mitochondrial activity of adjacent epithelial cancer cells in a co-culture system, as seen using MitoTracker. Finally, TFAM-deficient fibroblasts also showed a loss of caveolin-1 (Cav-1), a known breast cancer stromal biomarker. Loss of stromal fibroblast Cav-1 is associated with early tumor recurrence, metastasis and treatment failure, resulting in poor clinical outcome in breast cancer patients. Thus, this new experimental model system, employing glycolytic fibroblasts, may be highly clinically relevant. These studies also have implications for understanding the role of hydrogen peroxide production in oxidative damage and “host cell aging,” in providing a permissive metabolic microenvironment for promoting and sustaining tumor growth.",
"The Role of Amino Acids in the Diagnosis, Risk Assessment, and Treatment of Breast Cancer: A Review",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10527988,Review,"This review summarizes the role of amino acids in the diagnosis, risk assessment, imaging, and treatment of breast cancer. It was shown that the content of individual amino acids changes in breast cancer by an average of 10–15% compared with healthy controls. For some amino acids (Thr, Arg, Met, and Ser), an increase in concentration is more often observed in breast cancer, and for others, a decrease is observed (Asp, Pro, Trp, and His). The accuracy of diagnostics using individual amino acids is low and increases when a number of amino acids are combined with each other or with other metabolites. Gln/Glu, Asp, Arg, Leu/Ile, Lys, and Orn have the greatest significance in assessing the risk of breast cancer. The variability in the amino acid composition of biological fluids was shown to depend on the breast cancer phenotype, as well as the age, race, and menopausal status of patients. In general, the analysis of changes in the amino acid metabolism in breast cancer is a promising strategy not only for diagnosis, but also for developing new therapeutic agents, monitoring the treatment process, correcting complications after treatment, and evaluating survival rates.",
Progesterone and Breast Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7156851,Reviews,"Synthetic progestogens (progestins) have been linked to increased breast cancer risk; however, the role of endogenous progesterone in breast physiology and carcinogenesis is less clearly defined. Mechanistic studies using cell culture, tissue culture, and preclinical models implicate progesterone in breast carcinogenesis. In contrast, limited epidemiologic data generally do not show an association of circulating progesterone levels with risk, and it is unclear whether this reflects methodologic limitations or a truly null relationship. Challenges related to defining the role of progesterone in breast physiology and neoplasia include: complex interactions with estrogens and other hormones (eg, androgens, prolactin, etc.), accounting for timing of blood collections for hormone measurements among cycling women, and limitations of assays to measure progesterone metabolites in blood and progesterone receptor isotypes (PRs) in tissues.

Dietary Natural Products for Prevention and Treatment of Breast Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5537842,Review,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer among females worldwide.

Substantial experimental studies indicated that many dietary natural products could affect the development and progression of breast cancer, such as soy, pomegranate, mangosteen, citrus fruits, apple, grape, mango, cruciferous vegetables, ginger, garlic, black cumin, edible macro-fungi, and cereals. Their anti-breast cancer effects involve various mechanisms of action, such as downregulating ER-α expression and activity, inhibiting proliferation, migration, metastasis and angiogenesis of breast tumor cells, inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, and sensitizing breast tumor cells to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. This review summarizes the potential role of dietary natural products and their major bioactive components in prevention and treatment of breast cancer, and special attention was paid to the mechanisms of action.",
The involvement of oncobiosis and bacterial metabolite signaling in metastasis formation in breast cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8825384,Article,"Breast cancer, the most frequent cancer in women, is characterized by pathological changes to the microbiome of breast tissue, the tumor, the gut, and the urinary tract. Changes to the microbiome are determined by the stage, grade, origin (NST/lobular), and receptor status of the tumor. This year is the 50th anniversary of when Hill and colleagues first showed that changes to the gut microbiome can support breast cancer growth, namely that the oncobiome can reactivate excreted estrogens. The currently available human and murine data suggest that oncobiosis is not a cause of breast cancer, but can support its growth. Furthermore, preexisting dysbiosis and the predisposition to cancer are transplantable. The breast’s and breast cancer’s inherent microbiome and the gut microbiome promote breast cancer growth by reactivating estrogens, rearranging cancer cell metabolism, bringing about a more inflammatory microenvironment, and reducing the number of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Furthermore, the gut microbiome can produce cytostatic metabolites, the production of which decreases or blunts breast cancer. The role of oncobiosis in the urinary tract is largely uncharted. Oncobiosis in breast cancer supports invasion, metastasis, and recurrence by supporting cellular movement, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, cancer stem cell function, and diapedesis. Finally, the oncobiome can modify the pharmacokinetics of chemotherapeutic drugs. The microbiome provides novel leverage on breast cancer that should be exploited for better management of the disease.",
"Adverse outcome pathways for ionizing radiation and breast cancer involve direct and indirect DNA damage, oxidative stress, inflammation, genomic instability, and interaction with hormonal regulation of the breast",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7261741,Review Article,"Knowledge about established breast carcinogens can support improved and modernized toxicological testing methods by identifying key mechanistic events. Ionizing radiation (IR) increases the risk of breast cancer, especially for women and for exposure at younger ages, and evidence overall supports a linear dose–response relationship. We used the Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) framework to outline and evaluate the evidence linking ionizing radiation with breast cancer from molecular initiating events to the adverse outcome through intermediate key events, creating a qualitative AOP. We identified key events based on review articles, searched PubMed for recent literature on key events and IR, and identified additional papers using references. We manually curated publications and evaluated data quality. Ionizing radiation directly and indirectly causes DNA damage and increases production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS). RONS lead to DNA damage and epigenetic changes leading to mutations and genomic instability (GI). Proliferation amplifies the effects of DNA damage and mutations leading to the AO of breast cancer. Separately, RONS and DNA damage also increase inflammation. Inflammation contributes to direct and indirect effects (effects in cells not directly reached by IR) via positive feedback to RONS and DNA damage, and separately increases proliferation and breast cancer through pro-carcinogenic effects on cells and tissue. For example, gene expression changes alter inflammatory mediators, resulting in improved survival and growth of cancer cells and a more hospitable tissue environment. All of these events overlap at multiple points with events characteristic of “background” induction of breast carcinogenesis, including hormone-responsive proliferation, oxidative activity, and DNA damage. These overlaps make the breast particularly susceptible to ionizing radiation and reinforce that these biological activities are important characteristics of carcinogens. Agents that increase these biological processes should be considered potential breast carcinogens, and predictive methods are needed to identify chemicals that increase these processes. Techniques are available to measure RONS, DNA damage and mutation, cell proliferation, and some inflammatory proteins or processes. Improved assays are needed to measure GI and chronic inflammation, as well as the interaction with hormonally driven development and proliferation. Several methods measure diverse epigenetic changes, but it is not clear which changes are relevant to breast cancer. In addition, most toxicological assays are not conducted in mammary tissue, and so it is a priority to evaluate if results from other tissues are generalizable to breast, or to conduct assays in breast tissue. Developing and applying these assays to identify exposures of concern will facilitate efforts to reduce subsequent breast cancer risk.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7261741/bin/204_2020_2752_MOESM1_ESM.xlsx, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7261741/bin/204_2020_2752_MOESM2_ESM.xlsx, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7261741/bin/204_2020_2752_MOESM3_ESM.xlsx"

Obesity comorbidities include many associated cancers and are estimated to account for 20% of female cancer deaths in the USA. Breast cancer, in particular, is associated with obesity and is the focus of this review. The exact causal links between obesity and breast cancer remain unclear. Still, interactions have emerged between body mass index, tumor molecular subtype, genetic background, and environmental factors that strongly suggest obesity influences the risk and progression of certain breast cancers. Supportive preclinical research uses various diet-induced obesity models to demonstrate that weight loss, via dietary interventions or changes in energy expenditure, reduces the onset or progression of breast cancers. Ongoing and future studies are now aimed at elucidating the underpinning mechanisms behind weight-loss-driven observations to improve therapy and outcomes in patients with breast cancer and reduce risk. This review aims to summarize the rapidly emerging literature on obesity and weight loss strategies with a focused discussion of bariatric surgery in both clinical and preclinical studies detailing the complex interactions between metabolism, immune response, and immunotherapy in the setting of obesity and breast cancer.",
Inflammatory Biomarkers and Breast Cancer Risk: A Systematic Review of the Evidence and Future Potential for Intervention Research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7432395,Review,"Measuring systemic chronic inflammatory markers in the blood may be one way of understanding the role of inflammation in breast cancer risk, and might provide an intermediate outcome marker in prevention studies. Here, we present the results of a systematic review of prospective epidemiologic studies that examined associations between systemic inflammatory biomarkers measured in blood and breast cancer risk. From 1 January 2014 to 20 April 2020, we identified 18 unique studies (from 16 publications) that examined the association of systemic inflammatory biomarkers measured in blood with breast cancer risk using prospectively collected epidemiologic data. Only one marker, C-reactive protein, was studied extensively (measured in 13 of the 16 publications), and had some evidence of a positive association with breast cancer risk. Evidence associating other inflammatory biomarkers and more comprehensive panels of markers with the development of breast cancer is limited. Future prospective evidence from expanded panels of systemic blood inflammatory biomarkers is needed to establish strong and independent links with breast cancer risk, along with mechanistic studies to understand inflammatory pathways and demonstrate how breast tissue responds to chronic inflammation. This knowledge could ultimately support the development and evaluation of mechanistically driven interventions to reduce inflammation and prevent breast cancer.",

Counteracting Chemoresistance with Metformin in Breast Cancers: Targeting Cancer Stem Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7565921,Review,"Despite the leaps and bounds in achieving success in the management and treatment of breast cancers through surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, breast cancer remains the most frequently occurring cancer in women and the most common cause of cancer-related deaths among women. Systemic therapeutic approaches, such as chemotherapy, although beneficial in treating and curing breast cancer subjects with localized breast tumors, tend to fail in metastatic cases of the disease due to (a) an acquired resistance to the chemotherapeutic drug and (b) the development of intrinsic resistance to therapy. The existence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) plays a crucial role in both acquired and intrinsic chemoresistance. CSCs are less abundant than terminally differentiated cancer cells and confer chemoresistance through a unique altered metabolism and capability to evade the immune response system. Furthermore, CSCs possess active DNA repair systems, transporters that support multidrug resistance (MDR), advanced detoxification processes, and the ability to self-renew and differentiate into tumor progenitor cells, thereby supporting cancer invasion, metastasis, and recurrence/relapse. Hence, current research is focusing on targeting CSCs to overcome resistance and improve the efficacy of the treatment and management of breast cancer. Studies revealed that metformin (1, 1-dimethylbiguanide), a widely used anti-hyperglycemic agent, sensitizes tumor response to various chemotherapeutic drugs. Metformin selectively targets CSCs and improves the hypoxic microenvironment, suppresses the tumor metastasis and inflammation, as well as regulates the metabolic programming, induces apoptosis, and reverses epithelial–mesenchymal transition and MDR. Here, we discuss cancer (breast cancer) and chemoresistance, the molecular mechanisms of chemoresistance in breast cancers, and metformin as a chemo-sensitizing/re-sensitizing agent, with a particular focus on breast CSCs as a critical contributing factor to acquired and intrinsic chemoresistance. The review outlines the prospects and directions for a better understanding and re-purposing of metformin as an anti-cancer/chemo-sensitizing drug in the treatment of breast cancer. It intends to provide a rationale for the use of metformin as a combinatory therapy in a clinical setting.",
Regulation of breast cancer metastasis signaling by miRNAs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7487050,Article,"Despite the decline in death rate from breast cancer and recent advances in targeted therapies and combinations for the treatment of metastatic disease, metastatic breast cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer-associated death in U.S. women. The invasion-metastasis cascade involves a number of steps and multitudes of proteins and signaling molecules. The pathways include invasion, intravasation, circulation, extravasation, infiltration into a distant site to form a metastatic niche, and micrometastasis formation in a new environment. Each of these processes is regulated by changes in gene expression. Noncoding RNAs including microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in breast cancer tumorigenesis, progression, and metastasis by post-transcriptional regulation of target gene expression. miRNAs can stimulate oncogenesis (oncomiRs), inhibit tumor growth (tumor suppressors or miRsupps), and regulate gene targets in metastasis (metastamiRs). The goal of this review is to summarize some of the key miRNAs that regulate genes and pathways involved in metastatic breast cancer with an emphasis on estrogen receptor α (ERα+) breast cancer. We reviewed the identity, regulation, human breast tumor expression, and reported prognostic significance of miRNAs that have been documented to directly target key genes in pathways, including epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) contributing to the metastatic cascade. We critically evaluated the evidence for metastamiRs and their targets and miRNA regulation of metastasis suppressor genes in breast cancer progression and metastasis. It is clear that our understanding of miRNA regulation of targets in metastasis is incomplete.",

Label-Free Proteomics Revealed Oxidative Stress and Inflammation as Factors That Enhance Chemoresistance in Luminal Breast Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6702830,Research Article,"Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-associated death among women worldwide. Its high mortality rate is related to resistance towards chemotherapies, which is one of the major challenges of breast cancer research. In this study, we used label-free mass spectrometry- (MS-) based proteomics to investigate the differences between circulating proteins in the plasma of patients with chemoresponsive and chemoresistant luminal A breast cancer. MS analysis revealed 205 differentially expressed proteins. Furthermore, we used in silico tools to build protein-protein interaction networks. Most of the upregulated proteins in the chemoresistant group were closely related and tightly linked. The predominant networks were related to oxidative stress, the inflammatory response, and the complement cascade. Through this analysis, we identified inflammation and oxidative stress as central processes of breast cancer chemoresistance. Furthermore, we confirmed our hypothesis by evaluating oxidative stress and performing cytokine profiling in our cohort. The connections among oxidative stress, inflammation, and the complement system described in our study seem to indicate a pivotal axis in breast cancer chemoresistance. Hence, these findings will have significant clinical implications for improving therapies to bypass breast cancer chemoresistance in the future.",

Oxidative stress contributes to the tamoxifen-induced killing of breast cancer cells: implications for tamoxifen therapy and resistance,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4756695,Article,"Tamoxifen is the accepted therapy for patients with estrogen receptor-α (ERα)-positive breast cancer. However, clinical resistance to tamoxifen, as demonstrated by recurrence or progression on therapy, is frequent and precedes death from metastases. To improve breast cancer treatment it is vital to understand the mechanisms that result in tamoxifen resistance. This study shows that concentrations of tamoxifen and its metabolites, which accumulate in tumors of patients, killed both ERα-positive and ERα-negative breast cancer cells. This depended on oxidative damage and anti-oxidants rescued the cancer cells from tamoxifen-induced apoptosis. Breast cancer cells responded to tamoxifen-induced oxidation by increasing Nrf2 expression and subsequent activation of the anti-oxidant response element (ARE). This increased the transcription of anti-oxidant genes and multidrug resistance transporters. As a result, breast cancer cells are able to destroy or export toxic oxidation products leading to increased survival from tamoxifen-induced oxidative damage. These responses in cancer cells also occur in breast tumors of tamoxifen-treated mice. Additionally, high levels of expression of Nrf2, ABCC1, ABCC3 plus NAD(P)H dehydrogenase quinone-1 in breast tumors of patients at the time of diagnosis were prognostic of poor survival after tamoxifen therapy. Therefore, overcoming tamoxifen-induced activation of the ARE could increase the efficacy of tamoxifen in treating breast cancer.",
Sporadic activation of an oxidative stress-dependent NRF2–p53 signaling network in breast epithelial spheroids and premalignancies,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7315801,Article,"Breast and mammary epithelial cells experience different local environments during tissue development and tumorigenesis. Microenvironmental heterogeneity gives rise to distinct cell-regulatory states whose identity and importance are just beginning to be appreciated. Cellular states diversify when clonal three-dimensional (3D) spheroids are cultured in basement membrane, and one such state is associated with stress tolerance and poor response to anticancer therapeutics. Here, we found that this state was jointly coordinated by the NRF2 and p53 pathways, which were co-stabilized by spontaneous oxidative stress within 3D cultures. Inhibition of NRF2 or p53 individually disrupted some of the transcripts defining the regulatory state but did not yield a notable phenotype in nontransformed breast epithelial cells. In contrast, combined perturbation prevented 3D growth in an oxidative stress-dependent manner. By integrating systems models of NRF2 and p53 signaling in a single oxidative-stress network, we recapitulated these observations and made predictions about oxidative-stress profiles during 3D growth. NRF2 and p53 signaling were similarly coordinated in normal breast epithelial tissue and hormone-negative ductal carcinoma in situ lesions, but were uncoupled in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a subtype in which p53 is usually mutated. Using the integrated model, we correlated the extent of this uncoupling in TNBC cell lines with the importance of NRF2 in the 3D growth of these cell lines and their predicted handling of oxidative stress. Our results point to an oxidative stress-tolerance network that is important for single cells during glandular development and the early stages of breast cancer.",

Targeting glucose‐6‐phosphate dehydrogenase by,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10087799,Original Article,"Dysregulation of G6PD involved in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is known to promote tumorigenesis. The PPP plays a pivotal role in meeting the anabolic demands of cancer cells. However, the detailed underlying molecular mechanisms of targeting the G6PD‐regulated PPP in breast cancer remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the molecular pathways mediating the effects of G6PD on cancer progression. Clinical sample analysis found that the expression of G6PD in breast cancer patients was higher than that in normal controls, and patients with higher G6PD expression had poor survival. Gene knockdown or inhibition of G6PD by 6‐AN in MCF‐7 and MDA‐MB‐231 cells significantly decreased cell viability, migration, and colony formation ability. G6PD enzyme activity was inhibited by 6‐AN treatment, which caused a transient upregulation of ROS. The elevated ROS was independent of cell apoptosis and thus associated with abnormal activated autophagy. Accumulated ROS levels induced autophagic cell death in breast cancer. Inhibition of G6PD suppresses tumour growth in preclinical models of breast cancer. Our results indicate that targeting the G6PD‐regulated PPP could restrain tumours",

However, very few consider the implication of genetic background and the effect of personalised nutrition on the risk and prognosis of breast cancer. A literature search was performed using the following databases: MEDLINE (Ovid), PubMed, Scopus and EMBASE (Ovid). The ensuing search terms were selected: genomics, nutrigenomics, breast cancer, breast neoplasms, cancer, nutrigenetics, diet–gene interaction, and Mediterranean, nutrition, polyphenols and diet. In this review, we discuss the Mediterranean-style diet and associated nutrients, evidence of benefit, impact on gene expression and evidence of interactions with genotype and how this interaction can modify breast cancer risk and progression. In addition, the impact of nutrients commonly associated with a Mediterranean-style diet, on breast cancer treatment, and synergistic effects are mentioned when modified by genotype. Some evidence exists around the benefit of a gene-based personalised diet based on a Mediterranean-style dietary pattern, but further evidence in the form of clinical trials is required before such an approach can be comprehensively implemented.",

To study metabolic reprogramming in different mesenchymal states, we analyzed protein expression following EMT in the breast epithelial cell model D492 with single-shot LFQ supported by a SILAC proteomics approach. The D492 EMT cell model contains three cell lines: the epithelial D492 cells, the mesenchymal D492M cells, and a partial mesenchymal, tumorigenic variant of D492 that overexpresses the oncogene HER2. The analysis classified the D492 and D492M cells as basal-like and D492HER2 as claudin-low. Comparative analysis of D492 and D492M to tumorigenic D492HER2 differentiated metabolic markers of migration from those of invasion.

Phytotherapy and Nutritional Supplements on Breast Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5563402,Review Article,"Breast cancer is the most frequent type of nonskin malignancy among women worldwide. In general, conventional cancer treatment options (i.e., surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, biological therapy, and hormone therapy) are not completely effective. Recurrence and other pathologic situations are still an issue in breast cancer patients due to side effects, toxicity of drugs in normal cells, and aggressive behaviour of the tumours. From this point of view, breast cancer therapy and adjuvant methods represent a promising and challenging field for researchers. In the last few years, the use of some types of complementary medicines by women with a history of breast cancer has significantly increased such as phytotherapeutic products and nutritional supplements. Despite this, the use of such approaches in oncologic processes may be problematic and patient's health risks can arise such as interference with the efficacy of standard cancer treatment. The present review gives an overview of the most usual phytotherapeutic products and nutritional supplements with application in breast cancer patients as adjuvant approach. Regardless of the contradictory results of scientific evidence, we demonstrated the need to perform additional investigation, mainly well-designed clinical trials in order to establish correlations and allow for further validated outcomes concerning the efficacy, safety, and clinical evidence-based recommendation of these products.",
The autophagic tumor stroma model of cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3047615,Report,"A loss of stromal caveolin-1 (Cav-1) in the tumor fibroblast compartment is associated with early tumor recurrence, lymphnode metastasis and tamoxifen-resistance, resulting in poor clinical outcome in breast cancer patients. Here, we have used Cav-1 (−/−) null mice as a pre-clinical model for this “lethal tumor micro-environment”. Metabolic profiling of Cav-1 (−/−) mammary fat pads revealed the upregulation of numerous metabolites (nearly 100), indicative of a major catabolic phenotype. Our results are consistent with the induction of oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and autophagy/mitophagy. The two most prominent metabolites that emerged from this analysis were ADMA (asymmetric dimethyl arginine) and BHB (beta-hydroxybutyrate; a ketone body), which are markers of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, respectively. Transcriptional profiling of Cav-1 (−/−) stromal cells and human tumor stroma from breast cancer patients directly supported an association with oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and autophagy/mitophagy, as well as ADMA and ketone production. MicroRNA profiling of Cav-1 (−/−) stromal cells revealed the upregulation of two key cancer-related miR's, namely miR-31 and miR-34c. Consistent with our metabolic findings, these miR's are associated with oxidative stress (miR-34c) or activation of the hypoxic response/HIF1α (miR-31), which is sufficient to drive authophagy/mitophagy. Thus, via an unbiased comprehensive analysis of a lethal tumor micro-environment, we have identified a number of candidate biomarkers (ADMA, ketones and miR-31/34c) that could be used to identify high-risk cancer patients at diagnosis, for treatment stratification and/or for evaluating therapeutic efficacy during anti-cancer therapy. We propose that the levels of these key biomarkers (ADMA, ketones/BHB, miR-31 and miR-34c) could be (1) assayed using serum or plasma from cancer patients or (2) performed directly on excised tumor tissue. Importantly, induction of oxidative stress and autophagy/mitophagy in the tumor stromal compartment provides a means by which epithelial cancer cells can directly “feed off” of stromal-derived essential nutrients, chemical building blocks (amino acids, nucleotides) and energy-rich metabolites (glutamine, pyruvate, ketones/BHB), driving tumor progression and metastasis. Essentially, aggressive cancer cells are “eating” the cancer-associated fibroblasts via autophagy/mitophagy in the tumor micro-environment. Lastly, we discuss that this “autophagic tumor stroma model of cancer metabolism” provides a viable solution to the “autophagy paradox” in cancer etiology and chemotherapy.",

Although strategies such as Breast Cancer Awareness Month in October focus on early detection, lifestyle changes are seldom discussed other than dietary concerns and physical activity. Lifestyle modifications centered on diet and exercise have been demonstrated to affect overall disease-free survival in breast cancer. Since the early 2000s, the role of the human gut microbiota and its relation to breast cancer has become a major area of interest in the scientific and medical community. We live and survive owing to the symbiotic relationship with the microorganisms within us: the human microbiota. Scientific advances have identified a subset of the gut microbiota: the estrobolome, those bacteria that have the genetic capability to metabolize estrogen, which plays a key role in most breast cancers. Recent research provides evidence that the gut microbiome plays a substantial role in estrogen regulation. Gut microbiota diversity appears to be an essential component of overall health, including breast health. Future research attention should include a more extensive focus on the role of the human gut microbiota in breast cancer.",
The Proliferative and Apoptotic Landscape of Basal-like Breast Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6387372,Review,"Basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) is an aggressive molecular subtype that represents up to 15% of breast cancers. It occurs in younger patients, and typically shows rapid development of locoregional and distant metastasis, resulting in a relatively high mortality rate. Its defining features are that it is positive for basal cytokeratins and, epidermal growth factor receptor and/or c-Kit. Problematically, it is typically negative for the estrogen receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), which means that it is unsuitable for either hormone therapy or targeted HER2 therapy. As a result, there are few therapeutic options for BLBC, and a major priority is to define molecular subgroups of BLBC that could be targeted therapeutically. In this review, we focus on the highly proliferative and anti-apoptotic phenotype of BLBC with the goal of defining potential therapeutic avenues, which could take advantage of these aspects of tumor development.",
"Role of Adipose Tissue-Derived Autotaxin, Lysophosphatidate Signaling, and Inflammation in the Progression and Treatment of Breast Cancer",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7460696,Review,"Autotaxin (ATX) is a secreted enzyme that produces lysophosphatidate (LPA), which signals through six G-protein coupled receptors, promoting tumor growth, metastasis, and survival from chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Many cancer cells produce ATX, but breast cancer cells express little ATX. In breast tumors, ATX is produced by tumor-associated stroma. Breast tumors are also surrounded by adipose tissue, which is a major bodily source of ATX. In mice, a high-fat diet increases adipocyte ATX production. ATX production in obesity is also increased because of low-level inflammation in the expanded adipose tissue. This increased ATX secretion and consequent LPA signaling is associated with decreased adiponectin production, which results in adverse metabolic profiles and glucose homeostasis. Increased ATX production by inflamed adipose tissue may explain the obesity-breast cancer association. Breast tumors produce inflammatory mediators that stimulate ATX transcription in tumor-adjacent adipose tissue. This drives a feedforward inflammatory cycle since increased LPA signaling increases production of more inflammatory mediators and cyclooxygenase-2. Inhibiting ATX activity, which has implications in breast cancer adjuvant treatments, attenuates this cycle. Targeting ATX activity and LPA signaling may potentially increase chemotherapy and radiotherapy efficacy, and decrease radiation-induced fibrosis morbidity independently of breast cancer type because most ATX is not derived from breast cancer cells.",
Evidence for a stromal-epithelial “lactate shuttle” in human tumors,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3142461,Report,"Recently, we proposed a new mechanism for understanding the Warburg effect in cancer metabolism. In this new paradigm, cancer-associated fibroblasts undergo aerobic glycolysis, and extrude lactate to “feed” adjacent cancer cells, which then drives mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative mitochondrial metabolism in cancer cells. Thus, there is vectorial transport of energy-rich substrates from the fibroblastic tumor stroma to anabolic cancer cells. A prediction of this hypothesis is that cancer-associated fibroblasts should express MCT4, a mono-carboxylate transporter that has been implicated in lactate efflux from glycolytic muscle fibers and astrocytes in the brain. To address this issue, we co-cultured MCF7 breast cancer cells with normal fibroblasts. Interestingly, our results directly show that breast cancer cells specifically induce the expression of MCT4 in cancer-associated fibroblasts; MCF7 cells alone and fibroblasts alone, both failed to express MCT4. We also show that the expression of MCT4 in cancer-associated fibroblasts is due to oxidative stress, and can be prevented by pre-treatment with the anti-oxidant N-acetyl-cysteine. In contrast to our results with MCT4, we see that MCT1, a transporter involved in lactate uptake, is specifically upregulated in MCF7 breast cancer cells when co-cultured with fibroblasts. Virtually identical results were also obtained with primary human breast cancer samples. In human breast cancers, MCT4 selectively labels the tumor stroma, e.g., the cancer-associated fibroblast compartment. Conversely, MCT1 was selectively expressed in the epithelial cancer cells within the same tumors. Functionally, we show that overexpression of MCT4 in fibroblasts protects both MCF7 cancer cells and fibroblasts against cell death, under co-culture conditions. Thus, we provide the first evidence for the existence of a stromal-epithelial lactate shuttle in human tumors, analogous to the lactate shuttles that are essential for the normal physiological function of muscle tissue and brain. These data are consistent with the “reverse Warburg effect,” which states that cancer-associated fibroblasts undergo aerobic glycolysis, thereby producing lactate, which is utilized as a metabolic substrate by adjacent cancer cells. In this model, “energy transfer” or “metabolic-coupling” between the tumor stroma and epithelial cancer cells “fuels” tumor growth and metastasis, via oxidative mitochondrial metabolism in anabolic cancer cells. Most importantly, our current findings provide a new rationale and novel strategy for anti-cancer therapies, by employing MCT inhibitors.",

Rat models of 17β-estradiol-induced mammary cancer reveal novel insights into breast cancer etiology and prevention,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5899232,Review,"Numerous laboratory and epidemiologic studies strongly implicate endogenous and exogenous estrogens in the etiology of breast cancer. Data summarized herein suggest that the ACI rat model of 17β-estradiol (E2)-induced mammary cancer is unique among rodent models in the extent to which it faithfully reflects the etiology and biology of luminal types of breast cancer, which together constitute ~70% of all breast cancers. E2 drives cancer development in this model through mechanisms that are largely dependent upon estrogen receptors and require progesterone and its receptors. Moreover, mammary cancer development appears to be associated with generation of oxidative stress and can be modified by multiple dietary factors, several of which may attenuate the actions of reactive oxygen species. Studies of susceptible ACI rats and resistant COP or BN rats provide novel insights into the genetic bases of susceptibility and the biological processes regulated by genetic determinants of susceptibility. This review summarizes research progress resulting from use of these physiologically relevant rat models to advance understanding of breast cancer etiology and prevention.",
Metabolic Reprogramming in Breast Cancer and Its Therapeutic Implications,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6406734,Review,Current standard-of-care (SOC) therapy for breast cancer includes targeted therapies such as endocrine therapy for estrogen receptor-alpha (ERα) positive; anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies for human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-enriched; and general chemotherapy for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtypes. These therapies frequently fail due to acquired or inherent resistance. Altered metabolism has been recognized as one of the major mechanisms underlying therapeutic resistance. There are several cues that dictate metabolic reprogramming that also account for the tumors’ metabolic plasticity. For metabolic therapy to be efficacious there is a need to understand the metabolic underpinnings of the different subtypes of breast cancer as well as the role the SOC treatments play in targeting the metabolic phenotype. Understanding the mechanism will allow us to identify potential therapeutic vulnerabilities. There are some very interesting questions being tackled by researchers today as they pertain to altered metabolism in breast cancer. What are the metabolic differences between the different subtypes of breast cancer? Do cancer cells have a metabolic pathway preference based on the site and stage of metastasis? How do the cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic cues dictate the metabolic phenotype? How do the nucleus and mitochondria coordinately regulate metabolism? How does sensitivity or resistance to SOC affect metabolic reprogramming and vice-versa? This review addresses these issues along with the latest updates in the field of breast cancer metabolism.,

This paradigm shift has focused attention on therapeutically targeting CSCs directly as means of eradicating the disease. In breast cancers, CSCs can be identified by cell surface markers and are characterized by their ability to self-renew and differentiate, resist chemotherapy and radiation, and initiate new tumors upon serial transplantation in xenografted mice. These functional properties of CSCs are regulated by both intracellular and extracellular factors including pluripotency-related transcription factors, intracellular signaling pathways and external stimuli. Several classes of natural products and synthesized compounds have been studied to target these regulatory elements and force CSCs to lose stemness and/or terminally differentiate and thereby achieve a therapeutic effect. However, realization of an effective treatment for breast cancers, focused on the biological effects of these agents on breast CSCs, their functions and signaling, has not yet been achieved. In this review, we delineate the intrinsic and extrinsic factors identified to date that control or promote stemness in breast CSCs and provide a comprehensive compilation of potential agents that have been studied to target breast CSCs, transcription factors and stemness-related signaling. Our aim is to stimulate further study of these agents that could become the basis for their use as stand-alone treatments or components of combination therapies effective against breast cancers.",

Notch signaling pathway: a comprehensive prognostic and gene expression profile analysis in breast cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9730604,Research,"Breast cancer is a complex disease exhibiting a great degree of heterogeneity due to different molecular subtypes. Notch signaling regulates the differentiation of breast epithelial cells during normal development and plays a crucial role in breast cancer progression through the abnormal expression of the Notch up-and down-stream effectors. To date, there are only a few patient-centered clinical studies using datasets characterizing the role of Notch signaling pathway regulators in breast cancer; thus, we investigate the role and functionality of these factors in different subtypes using publicly available databases containing records from large studies. High-throughput genomic data and clinical information extracted from TCGA were analyzed. We performed Kaplan–Meier survival and differential gene expression analyses using the HALLMARK_NOTCH_SIGNALING gene set. To determine if epigenetic regulation of the Notch regulators contributes to their expression, we analyzed methylation levels of these factors using the TCGA HumanMethylation450 Array data. Notch receptors and ligands expression is generally associated with the tumor subtype, grade, and stage. Furthermore, we showed gene expression levels of most Notch factors were associated with DNA methylation rate.

In addition, a great deal of evidence accumulating over the past decades has evinced the crosstalk between pyroptosis and tumor immunological therapy. Thus, a comprehensive summary combining the function of pyroptosis in breast cancer and antitumor immunity is imperative. We portray the prevalent knowledge of the multidimensional roles of pyroptosis in cancer and summarize the pyroptosis in breast cancer principally. Moreover, we elucidate the influence of inflammasomes and pyroptosis-produced cytokines on the tumor microenvironment (TME) of breast cancer.

RACK1 facilitates breast cancer progression by competitively inhibiting the binding of β-catenin to PSMD2 and enhancing the stability of β-catenin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10582012,Article,"The receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1) is a key scaffolding protein with multifunctional and multifaceted properties. By mediating protein-protein interactions, RACK1 integrates multiple intracellular signals involved in the regulation of various physiological and pathological processes. Dysregulation of RACK1 has been implicated in the initiation and progression of many tumors. However, the exact function of RACK1 in cancer cellular processes, especially in proliferation, remains controversial. Here, we show that RACK1 is required for breast cancer cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. This effect of RACK1 is associated with its ability to enhance β-catenin stability and activate the canonical WNT signaling pathway in breast cancer cells. We identified PSMD2, a key component of the proteasome, as a novel binding partner for RACK1 and β-catenin. Interestingly, although there is no interaction between RACK1 and β-catenin, RACK1 binds PSMD2 competitively with β-catenin. Moreover, RACK1 prevents ubiquitinated β-catenin from binding to PSMD2, thereby protecting β-catenin from proteasomal degradation. Collectively, our findings uncover a novel mechanism by which RACK1 increases β-catenin stability and promotes breast cancer proliferation.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10582012/bin/41419_2023_6191_MOESM1_ESM.pdf, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10582012/bin/41419_2023_6191_MOESM2_ESM.pdf, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10582012/bin/41419_2023_6191_MOESM3_ESM.tif, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10582012/bin/41419_2023_6191_MOESM4_ESM.tif, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10582012/bin/41419_2023_6191_MOESM5_ESM.tif, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10582012/bin/41419_2023_6191_MOESM6_ESM.tif, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10582012/bin/41419_2023_6191_MOESM7_ESM.docx, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10582012/bin/41419_2023_6191_MOESM8_ESM.xlsx, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10582012/bin/41419_2023_6191_MOESM9_ESM.xlsx, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10582012/bin/41419_2023_6191_MOESM10_ESM.xlsx"
Diet Quality Is Associated with Serum Antioxidant Capacity in Women with Breast Cancer: A Cross Sectional Study,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7824615,Article,"Oxidative stress produced by adjuvant treatments is associated with cell injury; however, a healthy diet can help mitigate it. The aim of this study is to investigate the association between diet quality and oxidative stress parameters in women subjected to adjuvant treatment for breast cancer. The sample comprised 70 women. Oxidative stress biomarkers and diet quality parameters based on the Brazilian Healthy Eating Index—Revised (BHEI-R)—were evaluated at baseline (p0) and after adjuvant treatment (p1). Ferric reducing antioxidant potential (FRAP) was associated with diet quality at p0. BHEI-R scores were not different between p0 and p1; however, scores from total vegetables, total fruits, milk and dairy products, and meat, eggs and legumes were lower during treatment. On the other hand, lower sodium and saturated fat intake observed at p1 counterbalanced the BHEI-R score. Oxidative stress parameters have increased at p1, but they were not associated with diet quality; thus, changes in component intake were not enough to promote changes in oxidative stress during treatment. It appears that diet can enhance patients’ antioxidant defense before treatment, which could lead to better outcomes in the long term. Further investigations may help to clarify the association between diet and oxidative stress in women with breast cancer.",
Cancer Stem Cell-Associated Pathways in the Metabolic Reprogramming of Breast Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7730588,Review,"Metabolic reprogramming of cancer is now considered a hallmark of many malignant tumors, including breast cancer, which remains the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women all over the world. One of the main challenges for the effective treatment of breast cancer emanates from the existence of a subpopulation of tumor-initiating cells, known as cancer stem cells (CSCs). Over the years, several pathways involved in the regulation of CSCs have been identified and characterized. Recent research has also shown that CSCs are capable of adopting a metabolic flexibility to survive under various stressors, contributing to chemo-resistance, metastasis, and disease relapse. This review summarizes the links between the metabolic adaptations of breast cancer cells and CSC-associated pathways. Identification of the drivers capable of the metabolic rewiring in breast cancer cells and CSCs and the signaling pathways contributing to metabolic flexibility may lead to the development of effective therapeutic strategies. This review also covers the role of these metabolic adaptation in conferring drug resistance and metastasis in breast CSCs.",
"An Updated Comprehensive Review on Vitamin A and Carotenoids in Breast Cancer: Mechanisms, Genetics, Assessment, Current Evidence, and Future Clinical Implications",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8465379,Review,"Vitamin A and carotenoids are fat-soluble micronutrients that play important role as powerful antioxidants modulating oxidative stress and cancer development. Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women. As the risk of breast cancer is dependent on various lifestyle factors such as dietary modifications, there is increasing interest surrounding the anti-cancerous properties of vitamin A and carotenoids. Despite the suggested protective roles of vitamin A and carotenoids in breast cancer development, their clinical application for the prevention and treatment of breast cancer is limited. In this narrative review, we discuss the roles of vitamin A and carotenoids along with the evaluation method of vitamin A status. We also exhibit the association of genetic variations involved in metabolism of vitamin A and carotenoids with cancers and other diseases. We demonstrate the epidemiological evidence for the relationship of vitamin A and carotenoids with breast cancer risk, their effects on cancer mechanism, and the recent updates in clinical practice of vitamin A or carotenoids as a potential therapeutic agent against breast cancer. This review provides insight into the preventive and therapeutic roles of vitamin A and carotenoids in breast cancer development and progression.",
Cardiovascular Disease and Breast Cancer: Where These Entities Intersect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6722327,Article,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of mortality in women, yet many people perceive breast cancer to be the number one threat to women’s health. CVD and breast cancer have several overlapping risk factors, such as obesity and smoking. Additionally, current breast cancer treatments can have a negative impact on cardiovascular health (eg, left ventricular dysfunction, accelerated CVD), and for women with pre-existing CVD, this might influence cancer treatment decisions by both the patient and the provider. Improvements in early detection and treatment of breast cancer have led to an increasing number of breast cancer survivors who are at risk of long-term cardiac complications from cancer treatments. For older women, CVD poses a greater mortality threat than breast cancer itself. This is the first scientific statement from the American Heart Association on CVD and breast cancer. This document will provide a comprehensive overview of the prevalence of these diseases, shared risk factors, the cardiotoxic effects of therapy, and the prevention and treatment of CVD in breast cancer patients.",
The emerging roles of metabolism in the crosstalk between breast cancer cells and tumor-associated macrophages,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10539698,Review,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer affecting women worldwide. Investigating metabolism in breast cancer may accelerate the exploitation of new therapeutic options for immunotherapies. Metabolic reprogramming can confer breast cancer cells (BCCs) with a survival advantage in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and metabolic alterations in breast cancer, and the corresponding metabolic byproducts can affect the function of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Additionally, TAMs undergo metabolic reprogramming in response to signals present in the TME, which can affect their function and breast cancer progression. Here, we review the metabolic crosstalk between BCCs and TAMs in terms of glucose, lipids, amino acids, iron, and adenosine metabolism. Summaries of inhibitors that target metabolism-related processes in BCCs or TAMs within breast cancer have also served as valuable inspiration for novel therapeutic approaches in the fight against this disease.

Metabolic shifts in residual breast cancer drive tumor recurrence,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5451224,Research Article,"Tumor recurrence is the leading cause of breast cancer–related death. Recurrences are largely driven by cancer cells that survive therapeutic intervention. This poorly understood population is referred to as minimal residual disease. Here, using mouse models that faithfully recapitulate human disease together with organoid cultures, we have demonstrated that residual cells acquire a transcriptionally distinct state from normal epithelium and primary tumors. Gene expression changes and functional characterization revealed altered lipid metabolism and elevated ROS as hallmarks of the cells that survive tumor regression. These residual cells exhibited increased oxidative DNA damage, potentiating the acquisition of somatic mutations during hormonal-induced expansion of the mammary cell population. Inhibition of either cellular fatty acid synthesis or fatty acid transport into mitochondria reduced cellular ROS levels and DNA damage, linking these features to lipid metabolism. Direct perturbation of these hallmarks in vivo, either by scavenging ROS or by halting the cyclic mammary cell population expansion, attenuated tumor recurrence. Finally, these observations were mirrored in transcriptomic and histological signatures of residual cancer cells from neoadjuvant-treated breast cancer patients. These results highlight the potential of lipid metabolism and ROS as therapeutic targets for reducing tumor recurrence in breast cancer patients.",
The potential of gas plasma technology for targeting breast cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9394754,Review,"Despite therapeutic improvements in recent years, breast cancer remains an often fatal disease. In addition, breast cancer ulceration may occur during late stages, further complicating therapeutic or palliative interventions. In the past decade, a novel technology received significant attention in the medical field: gas plasma. This topical treatment relies on the partial ionization of gases that simultaneously produce a plethora of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS). Such local ROS/RNS overload inactivates tumour cells in a non‐necrotic manner and was recently identified to induce immunogenic cancer cell death (ICD). ICD promotes dendritic cell maturation and amplifies antitumour immunity capable of targeting breast cancer metastases. Gas plasma technology was also shown to provide additive toxicity in combination with radio and chemotherapy and re‐sensitized drug‐resistant breast cancer cells. This work outlines the assets of gas plasma technology as a novel tool for targeting breast cancer by summarizing the action of plasma devices, the roles of ROS, signalling pathways, modes of cell death, combination therapies and immunological consequences of gas plasma exposure in breast cancer cells in vitro, in vivo, and in patient‐derived microtissues ex vivo.",

Curcumin as an Enhancer of Therapeutic Efficiency of Chemotherapy Drugs in Breast Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8878285,Review,"Female breast cancer is the world’s most prevalent cancer in 2020. Chemotherapy still remains a backbone in breast cancer therapy and is crucial in advanced and metastatic breast cancer treatment. The clinical efficiency of chemotherapy regimens is limited due to tumor heterogeneity, chemoresistance, and side effects. Chemotherapeutic drug combinations with natural products hold great promise for enhancing their anticancer efficacy. Curcumin is an ideal chemopreventive and chemotherapy agent owning to its multitargeting function on various regulatory molecules, key signaling pathways, and pharmacological safety. This review aimed to elucidate the potential role of curcumin in enhancing the efficacy of doxorubicin, paclitaxel, 5-fluorouracil, and cisplatin via combinational therapy. Additionally, the molecular mechanisms underlying the chemosensitizing activity of these combinations have been addressed. Overall, based on the promising therapeutic potential of curcumin in combination with conventional chemotherapy drugs, curcumin is of considerable value to develop as an adjunct for combination chemotherapy with current drugs to treat breast cancer. Furthermore, this topic may provide the frameworks for the future research direction of curcumin–chemotherapy combination studies and may benefit in the development of a novel therapeutic strategy to maximize the clinical efficacy of anticancer drugs while minimizing their side effects in the future breast cancer treatment.",

The literature on breast cancer risk has focused largely on adverse effects of night shift work and exposure to light at night (LAN), without considering potential effects of associated sleep disruptions. As it stands, studies on breast cancer risk have not considered the impact of both sleep and circadian disruption, and the possible interaction of the two through bidirectional pathways, on breast cancer risk in the population at large. We review and synthesize this literature, including: 1) studies of circadian disruption and incident breast cancer; 2) evidence for bidirectional interactions between sleep and circadian systems; 3) studies of sleep and incident breast cancer; and 4) potential mechanistic pathways by which interrelated sleep and circadian disruption may contribute to the etiology of breast cancer.",

Here we conducted a dose–response meta-analysis based on published observational studies to evaluate the association of vitamin D intake and blood vitamin D levels with breast cancer susceptibility. PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases were searched up to January 2019. The pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted to estimate the risk. We identified 70 relevant studies on blood vitamin D levels (50 studies) and vitamin D intake (20 studies), respectively. Linear and nonlinear trend analyses were performed and showed that an increase in blood vitamin D levels by 5 nmol/l was associated with a 6% decrease in breast cancer risk (OR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.93–0.96). Similar results were obtained for premenopausal (OR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.93–0.99) and postmenopausal women (OR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.94–0.98). The pooled OR of breast cancer risk for a 400IU/day increase in vitamin D intake was 0.97 (95% CI = 0.92–1.02). In conclusion, we found that breast cancer risk was inversely related to blood vitamin D levels; however, no significant association was observed in vitamin D intake.",
The obesity-breast cancer link: a multidisciplinary perspective,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9470704,Article,"Obesity, exceptionally prevalent in the USA, promotes the incidence and progression of numerous cancer types including breast cancer. Complex, interacting metabolic and immune dysregulation marks the development of both breast cancer and obesity. Obesity promotes chronic low-grade inflammation, particularly in white adipose tissue, which drives immune dysfunction marked by increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production, alternative macrophage activation, and reduced T cell function. Breast tissue is predominantly composed of white adipose, and developing breast cancer readily and directly interacts with cells and signals from adipose remodeled by obesity. This review discusses the biological mechanisms through which obesity promotes breast cancer, the role of obesity in breast cancer health disparities, and dietary interventions to mitigate the adverse effects of obesity on breast cancer. We detail the intersection of obesity and breast cancer, with an emphasis on the shared and unique patterns of immune dysregulation in these disease processes. We have highlighted key areas of breast cancer biology exacerbated by obesity, including incidence, progression, and therapeutic response. We posit that interception of obesity-driven breast cancer will require interventions that limit protumor signaling from obese adipose tissue and that consider genetic, structural, and social determinants of the obesity–breast cancer link. Finally, we detail the evidence for various dietary interventions to offset obesity effects in clinical and preclinical studies of breast cancer. In light of the strong associations between obesity and breast cancer and the rising rates of obesity in many parts of the world, the development of effective, safe, well-tolerated, and equitable interventions to limit the burden of obesity on breast cancer are urgently needed.",

Role of Tumor-Associated Myeloid Cells in Breast Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7464644,Review,"Stromal immune cells constitute the tumor microenvironment. These immune cell subsets include myeloid cells, the so-called tumor-associated myeloid cells (TAMCs), which are of two types: tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Breast tumors, particularly those in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2)-positive breast cancer and triple-negative breast cancer, are solid tumors containing immune cell stroma. TAMCs drive breast cancer progression via immune mediated, nonimmune-mediated, and metabolic interactions, thus serving as a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer. TAMC-associated breast cancer treatment approaches potentially involve the inhibition of TAM recruitment, modulation of TAM polarization/differentiation, reduction of TAM products, elimination of MDSCs, and reduction of MDSC products. Furthermore, TAMCs can enhance or restore immune responses during cancer immunotherapy. This review describes the role of TAMs and MDSCs in breast cancer and elucidates the clinical implications of TAMs and MDSCs as potential targets for breast cancer treatment.",

We identified ROS could negatively regulate NMT1 expression and NMT1 knockdown conversely promoted oxidative stress, which formed a feedback loop. Furthermore, inhibition of NMT1 caused degraded proteins increase and ER stress, which cross-talked with mitochondria to produce more ROS.

Metabolic pathways of energy production and utilization are dysregulated in tumour cells and this dysregulation is a newly accepted hallmark of cancer. Dysregulated metabolism is also hypothesized to be a feature of non-neoplastic cells in the tumour microenvironment. Obesity-associated factors regulate metabolic pathways in both breast cancer cells and cells in the breast microenvironment, which provides a molecular link between obesity and breast cancer.

Our findings suggested HM13 could act as a novel therapeutic target candidate for breast cancer and supported the idea that autophagy inducers might represent a new approach to treat breast cancer.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9509374/bin/41419_2022_5154_MOESM1_ESM.pdf, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9509374/bin/41419_2022_5154_MOESM2_ESM.pdf, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9509374/bin/41419_2022_5154_MOESM3_ESM.docx, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9509374/bin/41419_2022_5154_MOESM4_ESM.tif, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9509374/bin/41419_2022_5154_MOESM5_ESM.tif, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9509374/bin/41419_2022_5154_MOESM6_ESM.tif, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9509374/bin/41419_2022_5154_MOESM7_ESM.tif, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9509374/bin/41419_2022_5154_MOESM8_ESM.tif, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9509374/bin/41419_2022_5154_MOESM9_ESM.tif, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9509374/bin/41419_2022_5154_MOESM10_ESM.pdf, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9509374/bin/41419_2022_5154_MOESM11_ESM.xlsx"

The Role of Immune Cells in Breast Tissue and Immunotherapy for the Treatment of Breast Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7775885,Article,"Immune cells are present in normal breast tissue and in breast carcinoma. The nature and distribution of the immune cell subtypes in these tissues are reviewed to promote a better understanding of their important role in breast cancer prevention and treatment. We conducted a review of the literature to define the type, location, distribution, and role of immune cells in normal breast tissue and in in situ and invasive breast cancer. Immune cells in normal breast tissue are located predominantly within the epithelial component in breast ductal lobules. Immune cell subtypes representing innate immunity (NK, CD68+, and CD11c+ cells) and adaptive immunity (most commonly CD8+, but CD4+ and CD20+ as well) are present; CD8þs cells are the most common subtype and are primarily effector memory cells. Immune cells may recognize neoantigens and endogenous and exogenous ligands and may serve in chronic inflammation and immunosurveillance. Progression to breast cancer is characterized by increased immune cell infiltrates in tumor parenchyma and stroma, including CD4+ and CD8+ granzyme B+ cytotoxic T cells, B cells, macrophages and dendritic cells. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in breast cancer may serve as prognostic indicators for response to chemotherapy and for survival. Experimental strategies of adoptive transfer of breast tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte may allow regression of metastatic breast cancer and encourage development of innovative T-cell strategies for the immunotherapy of breast cancer. In conclusion, immune cells in breast tissues play an important role throughout breast carcinogenesis. An understanding of these roles has important implications for the prevention and the treatment of breast cancer.",

Targeting of HIF and its downstream targets in angiogenesis and metabolism has been unsuccessful so far in the breast cancer clinical setting, with major unresolved challenges residing in target selection, development of robust biomarkers for response prediction, and understanding and harnessing of escape mechanisms. This Review discusses the pathophysiological role of HIFs, angiogenesis, and metabolism in breast cancer and the challenges of targeting these features in patients with breast cancer. Rational therapeutic combinations, especially with immunotherapy and endocrine therapy, seem most promising in the clinical exploitation of the intricate interplay of HIFs, angiogenesis, and metabolism in breast cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment.",
Exploring the Potential Role of Circulating microRNAs as Biomarkers for Predicting Clinical Response to Neoadjuvant Therapy in Breast Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10297903,Review,"Breast cancer (BC) is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide. Neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) is increasingly being used to reduce tumor burden prior to surgical resection. However, current techniques for assessing tumor response have significant limitations. Additionally, drug resistance is commonly observed, raising a need to identify biomarkers that can predict treatment sensitivity and survival outcomes. Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and have been shown to play a significant role in cancer progression as tumor inducers or suppressors. The expression of circulating miRNAs has been found to be significantly altered in breast cancer patients. Moreover, recent studies have suggested that circulating miRNAs can serve as non-invasive biomarkers for predicting response to NAT. Therefore, this review provides a brief overview of recent studies that have demonstrated the potential of circulating miRNAs as biomarkers for predicting the clinical response to NAT in BC patients. The findings of this review will strengthen future research on developing miRNA-based biomarkers and their translation into medical practice, which could significantly improve the clinical management of BC patients undergoing NAT.",
Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Programs and Cancer Stem Cell Phenotypes: Mediators of Breast Cancer Therapy Resistance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7483945,Article,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) programs play essential functions in normal morphogenesis and organogenesis, including that occurring during mammary gland development and glandular regeneration. Historically, EMT programs were believed to reflect a loss of epithelial gene expression signatures and morphologies that give way to those associated with mesenchymal cells and their enhanced migratory and invasive behaviors. However, accumulating evidence now paints EMT programs as representing a spectrum of phenotypic behaviors that also serve to enhance cell survival, immune tolerance, and perhaps even metastatic dormancy. Equally important, the activation of EMT programs in transformed mammary epithelial cells not only enhances their acquisition of invasive and metastatic behaviors, but also expands their generation of chemoresistant breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs). Importantly, the net-effect of these events results in the appearance of recurrent metastatic lesions that remain refractory to the armamentarium of chemotherapies and targeted therapeutic agents deployed against advanced-stage breast cancers. Here we review the molecular and cellular mechanisms that contribute to the pathophysiology of EMT programs in human breast cancers and how these events impact their “stemness” and acquisition of chemoresistant phenotypes.",
The role of CPT1A as a biomarker of breast cancer progression: a bioinformatic approach,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9525709,Article,"Breast cancer is the commonest malignancy of women and with its incidence on the rise, the need to identify new targets for treatment is imperative. There is a growing interest in the role of lipid metabolism in cancer. Carnitine palmitoyl-transferase-1 (CPT-1); the rate limiting step in fatty acid oxidation, has been shown to be overexpressed in a range of tumours. There are three isoforms of CPT-1; A, B and C. It is CPT-1A that has been shown to be the predominant isoform which is overexpressed in breast cancer. We performed a bioinformatic analysis using readily available online platforms to establish the prognostic and predictive effects related to CPT-1A expression. These include the KM plotter, the Human Protein Atlas, the cBioPortal, the G2O, the MethSurvand the ROC plotter. A Network analysis was performed using the Oncomine platform and signalling pathways constituting the cancer hallmarks, including immune regulation as utilised by NanoString. The epigenetic pathways were obtained from the EpiFactor website. Spearman correlations (r) to determine the relationship between CPT-1A and the immune response were obtained using the TISIDB portal. Overexpression of CPT-1A largely confers a worse prognosis and CPT-1A progressively recruits a range of pathways as breast cancer progresses. CPT-1A’s interactions with cancer pathways is far wider than previously realised and includes associations with epigenetic regulation and immune evasion pathways, as well as wild-type moderate to high penetrant genes involved in hereditary breast cancer. Although CPT-1A genomic alterations are detected in 9% of breast carcinomas, both the alteration and the metagene associated with it, confers a poor prognosis. CPT-1A expression can be utilised as a biomarker of disease progression and as a potential therapeutic target.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9525709/bin/41598_2022_20585_MOESM1_ESM.pptx, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9525709/bin/41598_2022_20585_MOESM2_ESM.xlsx, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9525709/bin/41598_2022_20585_MOESM3_ESM.xlsx, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9525709/bin/41598_2022_20585_MOESM4_ESM.xlsx, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9525709/bin/41598_2022_20585_MOESM5_ESM.xlsx, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9525709/bin/41598_2022_20585_MOESM6_ESM.xlsx, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9525709/bin/41598_2022_20585_MOESM7_ESM.xlsx"

The Multifaceted Functions of Autophagy in Breast Cancer Development and Treatment,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8229352,Review,"Macroautophagy (herein referred to as autophagy) is a complex catabolic process characterized by the formation of double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes. During this process, autophagosomes engulf and deliver their intracellular content to lysosomes, where they are degraded by hydrolytic enzymes. Thereby, autophagy provides energy and building blocks to maintain cellular homeostasis and represents a dynamic recycling mechanism. Importantly, the clearance of damaged organelles and aggregated molecules by autophagy in normal cells contributes to cancer prevention. Therefore, the dysfunction of autophagy has a major impact on the cell fate and can contribute to tumorigenesis. Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women and has the highest mortality rate among all cancers in women worldwide. Breast cancer patients often have a good short-term prognosis, but long-term survivors often experience aggressive recurrence. This phenomenon might be explained by the high heterogeneity of breast cancer tumors rendering mammary tumors difficult to target. This review focuses on the mechanisms of autophagy during breast carcinogenesis and sheds light on the role of autophagy in the traits of aggressive breast cancer cells such as migration, invasion, and therapeutic resistance.",

Stress response pathway induction is also important for cancer cell survival. Indeed, validated targets for anti-cancer treatments include molecular chaperones, components of the unfolded protein response, the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and autophagy. We will focus on links between breast cancer and these processes, as well as the development of drug resistance, relapse, and treatment.",
RNF144A functions as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer through ubiquitin ligase activity-dependent regulation of stability and oncogenic functions of HSPA2,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7205990,Article,"Deregulation of E3 ubiquitin ligases is intimately implicated in breast cancer pathogenesis and progression, but the underlying mechanisms still remain elusive. Here we report that RING finger protein 144A (RNF144A), a poorly characterized member of the RING-in-between-RING family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, functions as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer. RNF144A was  downregulated in a subset of primary breast tumors and restoration of RNF144A suppressed breast cancer cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, invasion in vitro, tumor growth, and lung metastasis in vivo. In contrast, knockdown of RNF144A promoted malignant phenotypes of breast cancer cells. Quantitative proteomics and biochemical analysis revealed that RNF144A interacted with and targeted heat-shock protein family A member 2 (HSPA2), a putative oncoprotein that is frequently upregulated in human cancer and promotes tumor growth and progression, for ubiquitination and degradation. Notably, the ligase activity-defective mutants of RNF144A impaired its ability to induce ubiquitination and degradation of HSPA2, and to suppress breast cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion as compared with its wild-type counterpart. Moreover, RNF144A-mediated suppression of breast cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion was rescued by ectopic HSPA2 expression. Clinically, low RNF144A and high HSPA2 expression in breast cancer patients was correlated with aggressive clinicopathological characteristics and decreased overall and disease-free survival. Collectively, these findings reveal a previously unappreciated role for RNF144A in suppression of breast cancer growth and metastasis, and identify RNF144A as the first, to our knowledge, E3 ubiquitin ligase for HSPA2 in human cancer.",

The Impact of Oxidative Stress and AKT Pathway on Cancer Cell Functions and Its Application to Natural Products,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9495789,Review,"Oxidative stress and AKT serine-threonine kinase (AKT) are responsible for regulating several cell functions of cancer cells. Several natural products modulate both oxidative stress and AKT for anticancer effects. However, the impact of natural product-modulating oxidative stress and AKT on cell functions lacks systemic understanding. Notably, the contribution of regulating cell functions by AKT downstream effectors is not yet well integrated. This review explores the role of oxidative stress and AKT pathway (AKT/AKT effectors) on ten cell functions, including apoptosis, autophagy, endoplasmic reticulum stress, mitochondrial morphogenesis, ferroptosis, necroptosis, DNA damage response, senescence, migration, and cell-cycle progression. The impact of oxidative stress and AKT are connected to these cell functions through cell function mediators. Moreover, the AKT effectors related to cell functions are integrated. Based on this rationale, natural products with the modulating abilities for oxidative stress and AKT pathway exhibit the potential to regulate these cell functions, but some were rarely reported, particularly for AKT effectors. This review sheds light on understanding the roles of oxidative stress and AKT pathway in regulating cell functions, providing future directions for natural products in cancer treatment.",
Role of p53 in breast cancer progression: An insight into p53 targeted therapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10008729,Review,"The transcription factor p53 is an important regulator of a multitude of cellular processes. In the presence of genotoxic stress, p53 is activated to facilitate DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. In breast cancer, the tumor suppressive activities of p53 are frequently inactivated by either the overexpression of its negative regulator MDM2, or mutation which is present in 30-35% of all breast cancer cases. Notably, the frequency of p53 mutation is highly subtype dependent in breast cancers, with majority of hormone receptor-positive or luminal subtypes retaining the wild-type p53 status while hormone receptor-negative patients predominantly carry p53 mutations with gain-of-function oncogenic activities that contribute to poorer prognosis. Thus, a two-pronged strategy of targeting wild-type and mutant p53 in different subtypes of breast cancer can have clinical relevance. The development of p53-based therapies has rapidly progressed in recent years, and include unique small molecule chemical inhibitors, stapled peptides, PROTACs, as well as several genetic-based approaches using vectors and engineered antibodies. In this review, we highlight the therapeutic strategies that are in pre-clinical and clinical development to overcome p53 inactivation in both wild-type and mutant p53-bearing breast tumors, and discuss their efficacies and limitations in pre-clinical and clinical settings.",
Breast cancer extracellular vesicles-derived miR-1290 activates astrocytes in the brain metastatic microenvironment via the FOXA2→CNTF axis to promote progression of brain metastases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9387054,Article,"Mechanisms underlying breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM) are still unclear. In this study, we observed that extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted from breast cancer cells with increased expression of tGLI1, a BCBM-promoting transcription factor, strongly activated astrocytes. EV-derived microRNA/miRNA microarray revealed tGLI1-positive breast cancer cells highly secreted miR-1290 and miR-1246 encapsulated in EVs. Genetic knockin/knockout studies established a direct link between tGLI1 and both miRNAs. Datamining and analysis of patient samples revealed that BCBM patients had more circulating EV-miRs-1290/1246 than those without metastasis. Ectopic expression of miR-1290 or miR-1246 strongly activated astrocytes whereas their inhibitors abrogated the effect. Conditioned media from miR-1290- or miR-1246-overexpressing astrocytes promoted mammospheres. Furthermore, miRs-1290/1246 suppressed expression of FOXA2 transcription repressor, leading to CNTF cytokine secretion and subsequent activation of astrocytes. Finally, we conducted a mouse study to demonstrate that astrocytes overexpressing miR-1290, but not miR-1246, enhanced intracranial colonization and growth of breast cancer cells. Collectively, our findings demonstrate, for the first time, that breast cancer EV-derived miR-1290 and miR-1246 activate astrocytes in the brain metastatic microenvironment and that EV-derived miR-1290 promotes progression of brain metastases through the novel EV-miR-1290→FOXA2→CNTF signaling axis.",
Disulfiram (DSF) acts as a copper ionophore to induce copper‐dependent oxidative stress and mediate anti‐tumor efficacy in inflammatory breast cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4493866,Research Article,"Cancer cells often have increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS); however, acquisition of redox adaptive mechanisms allows for evasion of ROS‐mediated death. Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a distinct, advanced BC subtype characterized by high rates of residual disease and recurrence despite advances in multimodality treatment. Using a cellular model of IBC, we identified an oxidative stress response (OSR) signature in surviving IBC cells after administration of an acute dose of an ROS inducer. Metagene analysis of patient samples revealed significantly higher OSR scores in IBC tumor samples compared to normal or non‐IBC tissues, which may contribute to the poor response of IBC tumors to common treatment strategies, which often rely heavily on ROS induction. To combat this adaptation, we utilized a potent redox modulator, the FDA‐approved small molecule Disulfiram (DSF), alone and in combination with copper. DSF forms a complex with copper (DSF‐Cu) increasing intracellular copper concentration both in vitro and in vivo, bypassing the need for membrane transporters. DSF‐Cu antagonized NFκB signaling, aldehyde dehydrogenase activity and antioxidant levels, inducing oxidative stress‐mediated apoptosis in multiple IBC cellular models. In vivo, DSF‐Cu significantly inhibited tumor growth without significant toxicity, causing apoptosis only in tumor cells. These results indicate that IBC tumors are highly redox adapted, which may render them resistant to ROS‐inducing therapies. DSF, through redox modulation, may be a useful approach to enhance chemo‐ and/or radio‐sensitivity for advanced BC subtypes where therapeutic resistance is an impediment to durable responses to current standard of care.",

Microbial Alterations and Risk Factors of Breast Cancer: Connections and Mechanistic Insights,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7290701,Review,"Breast cancer-related mortality remains high worldwide, despite tremendous advances in diagnostics and therapeutics; hence, the quest for better strategies for disease management, as well as the identification of modifiable risk factors, continues. With recent leaps in genomic technologies, microbiota have emerged as major players in most cancers, including breast cancer. Interestingly, microbial alterations have been observed with some of the established risk factors of breast cancer, such as obesity, aging and periodontal disease. Higher levels of estrogen, a risk factor for breast cancer that cross-talks with other risk factors such as alcohol intake, obesity, parity, breastfeeding, early menarche and late menopause, are also modulated by microbial dysbiosis. In this review, we discuss the association between known breast cancer risk factors and altered microbiota. An important question related to microbial dysbiosis and cancer is the underlying mechanisms by which alterations in microbiota can support cancer progression. To this end, we review the involvement of microbial metabolites as effector molecules, the modulation of the metabolism of xenobiotics, the induction of systemic immune modulation, and altered responses to therapy owing to microbial dysbiosis. Given the association of breast cancer risk factors with microbial dysbiosis and the multitude of mechanisms altered by dysbiotic microbiota, an impaired microbiome is, in itself, an important risk factor.",

Cancer-associated adipocytes: key players in breast cancer progression,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6734503,Review,"Adipocytes are one of the primary stromal cells in many tissues, and they are considered to play an active role in the tumor microenvironment. Cancer-associated adipocytes (CAAs) are not only found adjacent to cancer cells, but also communicate with cancer cells through releasing various factors that can mediate local and systemic effects. The adipocyte-cancer cell crosstalk leads to phenotypical and functional changes of both cell types, which can further enhance tumor progression. Indeed, obesity, which is associated with an increase in adipose mass and an alteration of adipose tissue, is becoming pandemic in some countries and it is now considered to be an independent risk factor for cancer progression. In this review, we focus on the potential mechanisms involved with special attention to the adipocyte-cancer cell circle in breast cancer. We envisage that besides having a direct impact on tumor cells, CAAs systemically preconditions the tumor microenvironment by favoring anti-tumor immunity. A better understanding of cancer-associated adipocytes and the key molecular events in the adipocyte-cancer cell crosstalk will provide insights into tumor biology and permit the optimization of therapeutic strategies.",

Targeting the NFκB Signaling Pathways for Breast Cancer Prevention and Therapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6690202,Article,"The activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NFκB), a proinflammatory transcription factor, is a commonly observed phenomenon in breast cancer. It facilitates the development of a hormone-independent, invasive, high-grade, and late-stage tumor phenotype. Moreover, the commonly used cancer chemotherapy and radiotherapy approaches activate NFκB, leading to the development of invasive breast cancers that show resistance to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and endocrine therapy. Inhibition of NFκB results in an increase in the sensitivity of cancer cells to the apoptotic effects of chemotherapeutic agents and radiation and restoring hormone sensitivity, which is correlated with increased disease-free survival in patients with breast cancer. In this review article, we focus on the role of the NFκB signaling pathways in the development and progression of breast cancer and the validity of NFκB as a potential target for breast cancer prevention and therapy. We also discuss the recent findings that NFκB may have tumor suppressing activity in certain cancer types.

We further explored the dysregulated pathways between the two subtypes and constructed a microenvironmental landscape of breast cancer. Subsequently, we established a senescence-related scoring signature based on the expression of four SRGs in the training set (GSE21653) and validated its accuracy in two validation sets (GSE20685 and GSE25055). In the training set, patients in the high-risk group had a worse prognosis than patients in the low-risk group. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that risk score was an independent prognostic indicator. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis proved the predictive accuracy of the signature. The prognostic value of this signature was further confirmed in the validation sets. We also observed that a lower risk score was associated with a higher pathological response rate in patients with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. We next performed functional experiments to validate the results above. Our study demonstrated that these cellular senescence patterns effectively grouped patients at low or high risk of disease recurrence and revealed their potential roles in the tumor–immune–stromal microenvironment. These findings enhanced our understanding of the tumor immune microenvironment and provided new insights for improving the prognosis of breast cancer patients.",
Mitochondrial Flexibility of Breast Cancers: A Growth Advantage and a Therapeutic Opportunity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6562467,Review,"Breast cancers are very heterogeneous tissues with several cell types and metabolic pathways together sustaining the initiation and progression of disease and contributing to evasion from cancer therapies. Furthermore, breast cancer cells have an impressive metabolic plasticity that is regulated by the heterogeneous tumour microenvironment through bidirectional interactions. The structure and accessibility of nutrients within this unstable microenvironment influence the metabolism of cancer cells that shift between glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In this scenario, the mitochondrial energetic pathways of cancer cells can be reprogrammed to modulate breast cancer’s progression and aggressiveness. Moreover, mitochondrial alterations can lead to crosstalk between the mitochondria and the nucleus, and subsequently affect cancer tissue properties. This article reviewed the metabolic plasticity of breast cancer cells, focussing mainly on breast cancer mitochondrial metabolic reprogramming and the mitochondrial alterations influencing nuclear pathways. Finally, the therapeutic strategies targeting molecules and pathways regulating cancer mitochondrial alterations are highlighted.",

Therapeutic and diagnostic applications of exosomal circRNAs in breast cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10224846,Review,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are regulatory elements that are involved in orchestrating gene expression and protein functions and are implicated in various biological processes including cancer. Notably, breast cancer has a significant mortality rate and is one of the most common malignancies in women. CircRNAs have been demonstrated to contribute to the pathogenesis of breast cancer including its initiation, progression, metastasis, and resistance to drugs. By acting as miRNA sponges, circRNAs can indirectly influence gene expression by disrupting miRNA regulation of their target genes, ultimately altering the course of cancer development and progression. Additionally, circRNAs can interact with proteins and modulate their functions including signaling pathways involved in the initiation and development of cancer. Recently, circRNAs can encode peptides that play a role in the pathophysiology of breast cancer and other diseases and their potential as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for various cancers including breast cancer. CircRNAs possess biomarkers that differentiate, such as stability, specificity, and sensitivity, and can be detected in several biological specimens such as blood, saliva, and urine. Moreover, circRNAs play an important role in various cellular processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, all of which are integral factors in the development and progression of cancer. This review synthesizes the functions of circRNAs in breast cancer, scrutinizing their contributions to the onset and evolution of the disease through their interactions with exosomes and cancer-related intracellular pathways. It also delves into the potential use of circRNA as a biomarker and therapeutic target against breast cancer. It discusses various databases and online tools that offer crucial circRNA information and regulatory networks. Lastly, the challenges and prospects of utilizing circRNAs in clinical settings associated with breast cancer are explored.",
The oxytocin receptor signalling system and breast cancer: a critical review,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7483001,Review Article,"Breast cancer is making up one-quarter of all new female cancer cases diagnosed worldwide. Breast cancer surgeries, radiation therapies, cytotoxic chemotherapies and targeted therapies have made significant progress and play a dominant role in breast cancer patient management. However, many challenges remain, including resistance to systemic therapies, tumour recurrence and metastasis. The cyclic neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) elicits a plethora of biological responses via the oxytocin receptor (OTR) in both the central and peripheral nervous system, including social bonding, stress, maternal behaviour, sexual activity, uterus contraction, milk ejection and cancer. As a typical member of the G protein-coupled receptor family, OTR represents also an intriguing target for cancer therapy. There is emerging evidence that OTR plays a role in breast cancer development and progression, and several breast cancer cell lines express OTR. However, despite supporting evidence that OT lowers breast cancer risks, its mechanistic role in breast cancer development and the related signalling pathways are not fully understood. Here, we review the current knowledge of the OT/OTR signalling system in healthy breast tissue as well as in breast cancer, and discuss OTR as a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer management.",
Contribution of n-3 Long-Chain Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids to the Prevention of Breast Cancer Risk Factors,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9265492,Review,"Nowadays, diet and breast cancer are studied at different levels, particularly in tumor prevention and progression. Thus, the molecular mechanisms leading to better knowledge are deciphered with a higher precision. Among the molecules implicated in a preventive and anti-progressive way, n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LC-PUFAs) are good candidates. These molecules, like docosahexaenoic (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic (EPA) acids, are generally found in marine material, such as fat fishes or microalgae. EPA and DHA act as anti-proliferative, anti-invasive, and anti-angiogenic molecules in breast cancer cell lines, as well as in in vivo studies. A better characterization of the cellular and molecular pathways involving the action of these fatty acids is essential to have a realistic image of the therapeutic avenues envisaged behind their use. This need is reinforced by the increase in the number of clinical trials involving more and more n-3 LC-PUFAs, and this, in various pathologies ranging from obesity to a multitude of cancers. The objective of this review is, therefore, to highlight the new elements showing the preventive and beneficial effects of n-3 LC-PUFAs against the development and progression of breast cancer.",
Oxidative Stress Mediates the Antiproliferative Effects of Nelfinavir in Breast Cancer Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4900679,Research Article,"The discovery of the anti-proliferative activity of nelfinavir in HIV-free models has encouraged its investigation as anticancer drug. Although the molecular mechanism by which nelfinavir exerts antitumor activity is still unknown, its effects have been related to Akt inhibition. Here we tested the effects of nelfinavir on cell proliferation, viability and death in two human breast cancer cell lines and in human normal primary breast cells. To identify the mechanism of action of nelfinavir in breast cancer, we evaluated the involvement of the Akt pathway as well as the effects of nelfinavir on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and ROS-related enzymes activities. Nelfinavir reduced breast cancer cell viability by inducing apoptosis and necrosis, without affecting primary normal breast cells. The antitumor activity of nelfinavir was related to alterations of the cell redox state, coupled with an increase of intracellular ROS production limited to cancer cells. Nelfinavir treated tumor cells also displayed a downregulation of the Akt pathway due to disruption of the Akt-HSP90 complex, and subsequent degradation of Akt. These effects resulted to be ROS dependent, suggesting that ROS production is the primary step of nelfinavir anticancer activity. The analysis of ROS-producers and ROS-detoxifying enzymes revealed that nelfinavir-mediated ROS production was strictly linked to flavoenzymes activation. We demonstrated that ROS enhancement represents the main molecular mechanism required to induce cell death by nelfinavir in breast cancer cells, thus supporting the development of new and more potent oxidizing molecules for breast cancer therapy.",
GDNF-RET signaling in ER-positive breast cancers is a key determinant of response and resistance to aromatase inhibitors,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3686594,Article,"Most breast cancers at diagnosis are estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and depend on estrogen for growth and survival. Blocking estrogen biosynthesis by aromatase inhibitors (AI) has therefore become a first-line endocrine therapy for post-menopausal women with ER-positive breast cancers. Despite providing substantial improvements in patient outcome, AI resistance remains a major clinical challenge. The receptor tyrosine kinase RET and its co-receptor GFRα1 are upregulated in a subset of ER-positive breast cancers, and the RET ligand, glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is upregulated by inflammatory cytokines. Here we report the findings of a multidisciplinary strategy to address the impact of GDNF-RET signaling in the response to AI treatment. In breast cancer cells in 2D and 3D culture, GDNF-mediated RET signaling is enhanced in a model of AI resistance. Further, GDNF-RET signaling promoted the survival of AI-resistant cells and elicited resistance in AI-sensitive cells. Both these effects were selectively reverted by the RET kinase inhibitor NVP-BBT594. Gene expression profiling in ER-positive cancers defined a proliferation-independent GDNF-response signature that prognosed poor patient outcome and, more importantly, predicted poor response to AI treatment with the development of resistance. We validated these findings by demonstrating increased RET protein expression levels in an independent cohort of AI-resistant patient specimens. Together, our results establish GDNF-RET signaling as a rational therapeutic target to combat or delay the onset of AI resistance in breast cancer.",

Apart from the menopausal status, the trigger for developing breast cancer may vary widely from race to lifestyle factors. Epidemiological studies refer to obesity-associated metabolic changes as a critical risk factor behind the progression of breast cancer. The plethora of signals arising due to obesity-induced changes in adipocytes present in breast tumor microenvironment, significantly affect the behavior of adjacent breast cells. Adipocytes from white adipose tissue are currently recognized as an active endocrine organ secreting different bioactive compounds. However, due to excess energy intake and increased fat accumulation, there are morphological followed by secretory changes in adipocytes, which make the breast microenvironment proinflammatory. This proinflammatory milieu not only increases the risk of breast cancer development through hormone conversion, but it also plays a role in breast cancer progression through the activation of effector proteins responsible for the biological phenomenon of metastasis. The aim of this review is to present a comprehensive picture of the complex biology of obesity-induced changes in white adipocytes and demonstrate the relationship between obesity and breast cancer progression to metastasis.",

Mortality is associated mainly with the development of metastases. Identification of the mechanisms involved in metastasis formation is, therefore, a major public health issue. Among the proposed risk factors, chemical environment and pollution are increasingly suggested to have an effect on the signaling pathways involved in metastatic tumor cells emergence and progression. The purpose of this article is to summarize current knowledge about the role of environmental chemicals in breast cancer progression, metastasis formation and resistance to chemotherapy. Through a scoping review, we highlight the effects of a wide variety of environmental toxicants, including persistent organic pollutants and endocrine disruptors, on invasion mechanisms and metastatic processes in BC. We identified the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and cancer-stemness (the stem cell-like phenotype in tumors), two mechanisms suspected of playing key roles in the development of metastases and linked to chemoresistance, as potential targets of contaminants. We discuss then the recently described pro-migratory and pro-invasive Ah receptor signaling pathway and conclude that his role in BC progression is still controversial. In conclusion, although several pertinent pathways for the effects of xenobiotics have been identified, the mechanisms of actions for multiple other molecules remain to be established. The integral role of xenobiotics in the exposome in BC needs to be further explored through additional relevant epidemiological studies that can be extended to molecular mechanisms.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7672852/bin/12940_2020_670_MOESM1_ESM.docx

LncRNA MIR17HG Suppresses Breast Cancer Proliferation and Migration as ceRNA to Target FAM135A by Sponging miR-454-3p,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10625951,Original Paper,"Breast cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors in women, and causes a large number of cancer-related deaths. The main cause of death of breast cancer patients is tumor recurrence and metastasis. Recent studies show that lncRNA (Long non-coding RNA) plays an important role in breast cancer. However, the overall biological activity and clinical consequences of the lncRNA MIR17HG in breast cancer remain unclear. Thus, we investigate how the MIR17HG/miR-454-3p network impacts breast cancer cell proliferation and migration. Given the TCGA and Oncomine databases, the researchers evaluated variations in MIR17HG expression for the survival rates of breast cancer patients. The influence of MIR17HG on cell proliferation, migration, cell cycle, and the mRNA expression level of miR-454-3p and FAM135A (family with sequence similarity 135 member A) is identified. Luciferase assay was used to detect the regulatory effect of miR-454-3p on the 3′UTR region of FAM135A, and rescue experiments demonstrated that MIR17HG can up-regulate FAM135A expression by competitively binding miR-454-3p. The effect of FAM135A on the cloning and invasion of MCF-7 cells was detected. MIR17HG expression is reduced in breast cancer tissues, and patients with greater levels of MIR17HG expression have a better prognosis. MIR17HG overexpression caused G2/M arrest in breast cancer cells according to a flow cytometry assay. FAM135A knockdown enhances breast cancer cell proliferation and clone creation, as well as two-dimensional and three-dimensional migratory capacities. Patients with high FAM135A expression in their breast cancer had a better prognosis. These novel findings indicate that MIR17HG may be a potential target for breast cancer. Our findings demonstrated that MIR17HG might suppress breast cancer cell proliferation and migration by sponge miR-454-3p through ceRNA(competing endogenous RNAs) mechanism, indicating that targeting MIR17HG may be a feasible therapeutic candidate for breast cancer.",
MicroRNAs involved in drug resistance of breast cancer by regulating autophagy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7519632,Review,"Autophagy is a conserved catabolic process characterized by degradation and recycling of cytosolic components or organelles through a lysosome-dependent pathway. It has a complex and close relationship to drug resistance in breast cancer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding molecules that can influence numerous cellular processes including autophagy, through the posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression. Autophagy is regulated by many proteins and pathways, some of which in turn have been found to be regulated by miRNAs. These miRNAs may affect the drug resistance of breast cancer. Drug resistance is the main cause of distant recurrence, metastasis and death in breast cancer patients. In this review, we summarize the causative relationship between autophagy and drug resistance of breast cancer. The roles of autophagy-related proteins and pathways and their associated miRNAs in drug resistance of breast cancer are also discussed.",

Role of MicroRNA Regulation in Obesity-Associated Breast Cancer: Nutritional Perspectives,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5682994,Reviews,"Breast cancer is the most common malignancy diagnosed in women, and the incidence of breast cancer is increasing every year. Obesity has been identified as one of the major risk factors for breast cancer progression. The mechanisms by which obesity contributes to breast cancer development is not yet understood; however, there are a few mechanisms counted as potential producers of breast cancer in obesity, including insulin resistance, chronic inflammation and inflammatory cytokines, adipokines, and sex hormones. Recent emerging evidence suggests that alterations in microRNA (miRNA) expressions are found in several diseases, including breast cancer and obesity; however, miRNA roles in obesity-linked breast cancer are beginning to unravel. miRNAs are thought to be potential noninvasive biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of cancer patients with comorbid conditions of obesity as well as therapeutic targets. Recent studies have evidenced that nutrients and other dietary factors protect against cancer and obesity through modulation of miRNA expressions. Herein, we summarize a comprehensive overview of up-to-date information related to miRNAs and their molecular targets involved in obesity-associated breast cancer. We also address the mechanisms by which dietary factors modulate miRNA expression and its protective roles in obesity-associated breast cancer.

Evidence of Gene–Environment Interactions between Common Breast Cancer Susceptibility Loci and Established Environmental Risk Factors,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3609648,Research Article,"Various common genetic susceptibility loci have been identified for breast cancer; however, it is unclear how they combine with lifestyle/environmental risk factors to influence risk.

Diabetes-associated breast cancer is molecularly distinct and shows a DNA damage repair deficiency,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10795835,Research Article,"Diabetes commonly affects patients with cancer. We investigated the influence of diabetes on breast cancer biology using a 3-pronged approach that included analysis of orthotopic human tumor xenografts, patient tumors, and breast cancer cells exposed to diabetes/hyperglycemia-like conditions. We aimed to identify shared phenotypes and molecular signatures by investigating the metabolome, transcriptome, and tumor mutational burden. Diabetes and hyperglycemia did not enhance cell proliferation but induced mesenchymal and stem cell–like phenotypes linked to increased mobility and odds of metastasis. They also promoted oxyradical formation and both a transcriptome and mutational signatures of DNA repair deficiency. Moreover, food- and microbiome-derived metabolites tended to accumulate in breast tumors in the presence of diabetes, potentially affecting tumor biology. Breast cancer cells cultured under hyperglycemia-like conditions acquired increased DNA damage and sensitivity to DNA repair inhibitors. Based on these observations, we conclude that diabetes-associated breast tumors may show an increased drug response to DNA damage repair inhibitors.",
Impact of Stilbenes as Epigenetic Modulators of Breast Cancer Risk and Associated Biomarkers,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8472542,Review,"With the recent advancement of genetic screening for testing susceptibility to mammary oncogenesis in women, the relevance of the gene−environment interaction has become progressively apparent in the context of aberrant gene expressions. Fetal exposure to external stressors, hormones, and nutrients, along with the inherited genome, impact its traits, including cancer susceptibility. Currently, there is increasing interest in the role of epigenetic biomarkers such as genomic methylation signatures, plasma microRNAs, and alterations in cell-signaling pathways in the diagnosis and primary prevention of breast cancer, as well as its prognosis. Polyphenols like natural stilbenes have been shown to be effective in chemoprevention by exerting cytotoxic effects that can stall cell proliferation. Besides possessing antioxidant properties against the DNA-damaging effects of reactive oxygen species, stilbenes have also been observed to modulate cell-signaling pathways. With the increasing trend of early-life screening for hereditary breast cancer risks, the potency of different phytochemicals in harnessing the epigenetic biomarkers of breast cancer risk demand more investigation. This review will explore means of exploiting the abilities of stilbenes in altering the underlying factors that influence breast cancer risk, as well as the appearance of associated biomarkers.",

Several lines of evidence demonstrated distortion of the epigenetic landscape in breast cancer. Interestingly, mammary cells isolated from breast cancer patients and cultured ex vivo maintained the tumorigenic phenotype and exhibited aberrant epigenetic modifications. Recent studies indicated that the therapeutic efficiency for breast cancer regimens has increased over time, resulting in reduced mortality. Future medical treatment for breast cancer patients, however, will likely depend upon a better understanding of epigenetic modifications.

Breast Cancer CAFs: Spectrum of Phenotypes and Promising Targeting Avenues,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8583860,Review,"Activation of the tumor-associated stroma to support tumor growth is a common feature observed in different cancer entities. This principle is exemplified by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are educated by the tumor to shape its development across all stages. CAFs can alter the extracellular matrix (ECM) and secrete a variety of different molecules. In that manner they have the capability to affect activation, survival, proliferation, and migration of other stromal cells and cancer cell themselves. Alteration of the ECM, desmoplasia, is a common feature of breast cancer, indicating a prominent role for CAFs in shaping tumor development in the mammary gland. In this review, we summarize the multiple roles CAFs play in mammary carcinoma. We discuss experimental and clinical strategies to interfere with CAFs function in breast cancer.

E2F1 sumoylation as a protective cellular mechanism in oxidative stress response,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7334650,Biological Sciences,"Cells need to cope with oxidative stress caused by oxygen free radicals from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. We identify a role for E2F1 to halt cell cycle progression for cell survival upon oxidative stress. Oxidative stress induces sumoylation of E2F1, primarily at lysine 266, which specifically modulates E2F1 transcriptional activity to enhance cell cycle arrest for cell survival. Furthermore, we identify SENP3 as an E2F1-interacting partner and a desumoylating enzyme for E2F1. Oxidative stress inhibits the interaction between E2F1 and SENP3, and leads to accumulation of sumoylated E2F1. These data demonstrate that sumoylation of E2F1 is important for cell cycle arrest to provide cells the opportunity to cope with oxidative stress and survive.",

Both Epidemiological and experimental studies indicate a positive correlation between alcohol consumption and the risk of breast cancer. While alcohol exposure may promote the carcinogenesis or onset of breast cancer, it may as well enhance the progression and aggressiveness of existing mammary tumors. Recent progress in this line of research suggests that alcohol exposure is associated with invasive breast cancer and promotes the growth and metastasis of mammary tumors. There are multiple potential mechanisms involved in alcohol-stimulated progression and aggressiveness of breast cancer. Alcohol may increase the mobility of cancer cells by inducing cytoskeleton reorganization and enhancing the cancer cell invasion by causing degradation and reconstruction of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Moreover, alcohol may promote the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a hallmark of malignancy, and impair endothelial integrity, thereby increasing the dissemination of breast cancer cells and facilitating metastasis. Furthermore, alcohol may stimulate tumor angiogenesis through the activation of cytokines and chemokines which promotes tumor growth. Additionally, alcohol may increase the cancer stem cell population which affects neoplastic cell behavior, aggressiveness, and the therapeutic response. Alcohol can be metabolized in the mammary tissues and breast cancer cells which produces reactive oxygen species (ROS), causing oxidative stress. Recent studies suggest that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family, particularly ErbB2 (a member of this family), is involved in alcohol-mediated tumor promotion. Breast cancer cells or mammary epithelial cells over-expressing ErbB2 are more sensitive to alcohol’s tumor promoting effects. There is considerable cross-talk between oxidative stress and EGFR/ErbB2 signaling. This review further discusses how the interaction between oxidative stress and EGFR/ErbB2 signaling contributes to the cellular and molecular events associated with breast cancer aggressiveness. We also discuss the potential therapeutic approaches for cancer patients who drink alcoholic beverages.",

Insights into the key roles of proteoglycans in breast cancer biology and translational medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4433619,Article,"Proteoglycans control numerous normal and pathological processes, among which are morphogenesis, tissue repair, inflammation, vascularization and cancer metastasis. During tumor development and growth, proteoglycan expression is markedly modified in the tumor microenvironment. Altered expression of proteoglycans on tumor and stromal cell membranes affects cancer cell signaling, growth and survival, cell adhesion, migration and angiogenesis. Despite the high complexity and heterogeneity of breast cancer, the rapid evolution in our knowledge that proteoglycans are among the key players in the breast tumor microenvironment suggests their potential as pharmacological targets in this type of cancer. It has been recently suggested that pharmacological treatment may target proteoglycan metabolism, their utilization as targets for immunotherapy or their direct use as therapeutic agents. The diversity inherent in the proteoglycans that will be presented herein provides the potential for multiple layers of regulation of breast tumor behavior. This review summarizes recent developments concerning the biology of selected proteoglycans in breast cancer, and presents potential targeted therapeutic approaches based on their novel key roles in breast cancer.",

"Gut Metabolites and Breast Cancer: The Continuum of Dysbiosis, Breast Cancer Risk, and Potential Breast Cancer Therapy",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9409206,Review,"The complex association between the gut microbiome and cancer development has been an emerging field of study in recent years. The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in the overall maintenance of human health and interacts closely with the host immune system to prevent and fight infection. This review was designed to draw a comprehensive assessment and summary of recent research assessing the anticancer activity of the metabolites (produced by the gut microbiota) specifically against breast cancer. In this review, a total of 2701 articles were screened from different scientific databases (PubMed, Scopus, Embase and Web of Science) with 72 relevant articles included based on the predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Metabolites produced by the gut microbial communities have been researched for their health benefits and potential anticancer activity. For instance, the short-chain fatty acid, butyrate, has been evaluated against multiple cancer types, including breast cancer, and has demonstrated anticancer potential via various molecular pathways. Similarly, nisin, a bacteriocin, has presented with a range of anticancer properties primarily against gastrointestinal cancers, with nominal evidence supporting its use against breast cancer. Comparatively, a natural purine nucleoside, inosine, though it has not been thoroughly investigated as a natural anticancer agent, has shown promise in recent studies. Additionally, recent studies demonstrated that gut microbial metabolites influence the efficacy of standard chemotherapeutics and potentially be implemented as a combination therapy. Despite the promising evidence supporting the anticancer action of gut metabolites on different cancer types, the molecular mechanisms of action of this activity are not well established, especially against breast cancer and warrant further investigation. As such, future research must prioritise determining the dose-response relationship, molecular mechanisms, and conducting animal and clinical studies to validate in vitro findings. This review also highlights the potential future directions of this field.",
Oxidative stress in cancer associated fibroblasts drives tumor-stroma co-evolution,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3041164,Report,"Loss of stromal fibroblast caveolin-1 (Cav-1) is a powerful single independent predictor of poor prognosis in human breast cancer patients, and is associated with early tumor recurrence, lymph node metastasis and tamoxifen-resistance. We developed a novel co-culture system to understand the mechanism(s) by which a loss of stromal fibroblast Cav-1 induces a “lethal tumor microenvironment.” Here, we propose a new paradigm to explain the powerful prognostic value of stromal Cav-1. In this model, cancer cells induce oxidative stress in cancer-associated fibroblasts, which then acts as a “metabolic” and “mutagenic” motor to drive tumor-stroma co-evolution, DNA damage and aneuploidy in cancer cells. More specifically, we show that an acute loss of Cav-1 expression leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress and aerobic glycolysis in cancer associated fibroblasts. Also, we propose that defective mitochondria are removed from cancer-associated fibroblasts by autophagy/mitophagy that is induced by oxidative stress. As a consequence, cancer associated fibroblasts provide nutrients (such as lactate) to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism in adjacent cancer cells (the “Reverse Warburg effect”). We provide evidence that oxidative stress in cancer-associated fibroblasts is sufficient to induce genomic instability in adjacent cancer cells, via a bystander effect, potentially increasing their aggressive behavior. Finally, we directly demonstrate that nitric oxide (NO) over-production, secondary to Cav-1 loss, is the root cause for mitochondrial dysfunction in cancer associated fibroblasts. In support of this notion, treatment with anti-oxidants (such as N-acetyl-cysteine, metformin and quercetin) or NO inhibitors (L-NAME) was sufficient to reverse many of the cancer-associated fibroblast phenotypes that we describe. Thus, cancer cells use “oxidative stress” in adjacent fibroblasts (1) as an “engine” to fuel their own survival via the stromal production of nutrients and (ii) to drive their own mutagenic evolution towards a more aggressive phenotype, by promoting genomic instability. We also present evidence that the “field effect” in cancer biology could also be related to the stromal production of ROS and NO species. eNOS-expressing fibroblasts have the ability to downregulate Cav-1 and induce mitochondrial dysfunction in adjacent fibroblasts that do not express eNOS. As such, the effects of stromal oxidative stress can be laterally propagated, amplified and are effectively “contagious”—spread from cell-to-cell like a virus—creating an “oncogenic/mutagenic” field promoting widespread DNA damage.",
Nutraceuticals in the Mediterranean Diet: Potential Avenues for Breast Cancer Treatment,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8400469,Review,"The traditional Mediterranean Diet constitutes a food model that refers to the dietary patterns of the population living in countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea in the early 1960s. A huge volume of literature data suggests that the Mediterranean-style diet provides several dietary compounds that have been reported to exert beneficial biological effects against a wide spectrum of chronic illnesses, such as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases and cancer including breast carcinoma. Among bioactive nutrients identified as protective factors for breast cancer, natural polyphenols, retinoids, and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have been reported to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and antitumoral properties. The multiple anticancer mechanisms involved include the modulation of molecular events and signaling pathways associated with cell survival, proliferation, differentiation, migration, angiogenesis, antioxidant enzymes and immune responses. This review summarizes the anticancer action of some polyphenols, like resveratrol and epigallocatechin 3-gallate, retinoids and omega-3 PUFAs by highlighting the important hallmarks of cancer in terms of (i) cell cycle growth arrest, (ii) apoptosis, (iii) inflammation and (iv) angiogenesis. The data collected from in vitro and in vivo studies strongly indicate that these natural compounds could be the prospective candidates for the future anticancer therapeutics in breast cancer disease.",
"Overeating, caloric restriction and breast cancer risk by pathologic subtype: the EPIGEICAM study",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6405854,Article,"This study analyzes the association of excessive energy intake and caloric restriction with breast cancer (BC) risk taking into account the individual energy needs of Spanish women. We conducted a multicenter matched case-control study where 973 pairs completed lifestyle and food frequency questionnaires. Expected caloric intake was predicted from a linear regression model in controls, including calories consumed as dependent variable, basal metabolic rate as an offset and physical activity as explanatory. Overeating and caloric restriction were defined taking into account the 99% confidence interval of the predicted value. The association with BC risk, overall and by pathologic subtype, was evaluated using conditional and multinomial logistic regression models. While premenopausal women that consumed few calories (>20% below predicted) had lower BC risk (OR = 0.36; 95% CI = 0.21–0.63), postmenopausal women with an excessive intake (≥40% above predicted) showed an increased risk (OR = 2.81; 95% CI = 1.65–4.79). For every 20% increase in relative (observed/predicted) caloric intake the risk of hormone receptor positive (p-trend < 0.001) and HER2+ (p-trend = 0.015) tumours increased 13%, being this figure 7% for triple negative tumours. While high energy intake increases BC risk, caloric restriction could be protective. Moderate caloric restriction, in combination with regular physical activity, could be a good strategy for BC prevention.",
Betulinic acid chemosensitizes breast cancer by triggering ER stress-mediated apoptosis by directly targeting GRP78,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5970196,Article,"Stress-induced cellular defense machinery has a critical role in mediating cancer drug resistance, and targeting stress-related signaling has become a novel strategy to improve chemosensitivity. Betulinic acid (BA) is a naturally occurring pentacyclic triterpenoid with potent anticancer bioactivities in multiple malignancies, whereas its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here in, we found that BA has synergistic effects with taxol to induce breast cancer cells G2/M checkpoint arrest and apoptosis induction, but had little cytotoxicity effects on normal mammary epithelial cells. Drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) strategy further identified glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) as the direct interacting target of BA. BA administration significantly elevated GRP78-mediated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and resulted in the activation of protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK)/eukaryotic initiation factor 2a/CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein apoptotic pathway. GRP78 silencing or ER stress inhibitor salubrinal administration was revealed to abolish the anticancer effects of BA, indicating the critical role of GRP78 in mediating the bioactivity of BA. Molecular docking and coimmunoprecipitation assay further demonstrated that BA might competitively bind with ATPase domain of GRP78 to interrupt its interaction with ER stress sensor PERK, thereby initiating the downstream apoptosis cascade. In vivo breast cancer xenografts finally validated the chemosensitizing effects of BA and its biofunction in activating GRP78 to trigger ER stress-mediated apoptosis. Taken together, our study not only uncovers GRP78 as a novel target underlying the chemosensitizing effects of BA, but also highlights GRP78-based targeting strategy as a promising approach to improve breast cancer prognosis.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5970196/bin/41419_2018_669_MOESM1_ESM.tif, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5970196/bin/41419_2018_669_MOESM2_ESM.tif, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5970196/bin/41419_2018_669_MOESM3_ESM.tif, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5970196/bin/41419_2018_669_MOESM4_ESM.docx"
Breast cancer survival among young women: a review of the role of modifiable lifestyle factors,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4796361,Review Article,"Almost 7 % of breast cancers are diagnosed among women age 40 years and younger in Western populations. Clinical outcomes among young women are worse. Early age-of-onset increases the risk of contralateral breast cancer, local and distant recurrence, and subsequent mortality. Breast cancers in young women (BCYW) are more likely to present with triple-negative (TNBC), TP53-positive, and HER-2 over-expressing tumors than among older women. However, despite these known differences in breast cancer outcomes and tumor subtypes, there is limited understanding of the basic biology, epidemiology, and optimal therapeutic strategies for BCYW. Several modifiable lifestyle factors associated with reduced risk of developing breast cancer have also been implicated in improved prognosis among breast cancer survivors of all ages. Given the treatment-related toxicities and the extended window for late effects, long-term lifestyle modifications potentially offer significant benefits to BCYW. In this review, we propose a model identifying three main areas of lifestyle factors (energy imbalance, inflammation, and dietary nutrient adequacy) that may influence survival in BCYW. In addition, we provide a summary of mechanisms of action and a synthesis of previous research on each of these topics.",
The complex nature of heterogeneity and its roles in breast cancer biology and therapeutic responsiveness,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9997040,Endocrinology,"Heterogeneity is a complex feature of cells and tissues with many interacting components. Depending on the nature of the research context, interacting features of cellular, drug response, genetic, molecular, spatial, temporal, and vascular heterogeneity may be present. We describe the various forms of heterogeneity with examples of their interactions and how they play a role in affecting cellular phenotype and drug responses in breast cancer. While cellular heterogeneity may be the most widely described and invoked, many forms of heterogeneity are evident within the tumor microenvironment and affect responses to the endocrine and cytotoxic drugs widely used in standard clinical care. Drug response heterogeneity is a critical determinant of clinical response and curative potential and also is multifaceted when encountered. The interactive nature of some forms of heterogeneity is readily apparent. For example, the process of metastasis has the properties of both temporal and spatial heterogeneity within the host, whereas each individual metastatic deposit may exhibit cellular, genetic, molecular, and vascular heterogeneity. This review describes the many forms of heterogeneity, their integrated activities, and offers some insights into how heterogeneity may be understood and studied in the future.",

The AGEs/RAGE Transduction Signaling Prompts IL-8/CXCR1/2-Mediated Interaction between Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) and Breast Cancer Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9368521,Article,"Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and the cognate receptor, named RAGE, are involved in metabolic disorders characterized by hyperglycemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity. Moreover, the AGEs/RAGE transduction pathway prompts a dysfunctional interaction between breast cancer cells and tumor stroma toward the acquisition of malignant features. However, the action of the AGEs/RAGE axis in the main players of the tumor microenvironment, named breast cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), remains to be fully explored. In the present study, by chemokine array, we first assessed that interleukin-8 (IL-8) is the most up-regulated pro-inflammatory chemokine upon AGEs/RAGE activation in primary CAFs, obtained from breast tumors. Thereafter, we ascertained that the AGEs/RAGE signaling promotes a network cascade in CAFs, leading to the c-Fos-dependent regulation of IL-8. Next, using a conditioned medium from AGEs-exposed CAFs, we determined that IL-8/CXCR1/2 paracrine activation induces the acquisition of migratory and invasive features in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Altogether, our data provide new insights on the involvement of IL-8 in the AGEs/RAGE transduction pathway among the intricate connections linking breast cancer cells to the surrounding stroma. Hence, our findings may pave the way for further investigations to define the role of IL-8 as useful target for the better management of breast cancer patients exhibiting metabolic disorders.",

Metformin: The Answer to Cancer in a Flower? Current Knowledge and Future Prospects of Metformin as an Anti-Cancer Agent in Breast Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6995629,Review,"Interest has grown in studying the possible use of well-known anti-diabetic drugs as anti-cancer agents individually or in combination with, frequently used, chemotherapeutic agents and/or radiation, owing to the fact that diabetes heightens the risk, incidence, and rapid progression of cancers, including breast cancer, in an individual. In this regard, metformin (1, 1-dimethylbiguanide), well known as ‘Glucophage’ among diabetics, was reported to be cancer preventive while also being a potent anti-proliferative and anti-cancer agent. While meta-analysis studies reported a lower risk and incidence of breast cancer among diabetic individuals on a metformin treatment regimen, several in vitro, pre-clinical, and clinical studies reported the efficacy of using metformin individually as an anti-cancer/anti-tumor agent or in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs or radiation in the treatment of different forms of breast cancer. However, unanswered questions remain with regards to areas such as cancer treatment specific therapeutic dosing of metformin, specificity to cancer cells at high concentrations, resistance to metformin therapy, efficacy of combinatory therapeutic approaches, post-therapeutic relapse of the disease, and efficacy in cancer prevention in non-diabetic individuals. In the current article, we discuss the biology of metformin and its molecular mechanism of action, the existing cellular, pre-clinical, and clinical studies that have tested the anti-tumor potential of metformin as a potential anti-cancer/anti-tumor agent in breast cancer therapy, and outline the future prospects and directions for a better understanding and re-purposing of metformin as an anti-cancer drug in the treatment of breast cancer.",
Breast cancer microenvironment and obesity: challenges for therapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9470689,Article,"Women with obesity who develop breast cancer have a worsened prognosis with diminished survival rates and increased rates of metastasis. Obesity is also associated with decreased breast cancer response to endocrine and chemotherapeutic treatments. Studies utilizing multiple in vivo models of obesity as well as human breast tumors have enhanced our understanding of how obesity alters the breast tumor microenvironment. Changes in the complement and function of adipocytes, adipose-derived stromal cells, immune cells, and endothelial cells and remodeling of the extracellular matrix all contribute to the rapid growth of breast tumors in the context of obesity. Interactions of these cells enhance secretion of cytokines and adipokines as well as local levels of estrogen within the breast tumor microenvironment that promote resistance to multiple therapies.

Moreover, the Ehrlich model was induced in mice via subcutaneous injection of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma cells (EAC) in the mammary fat pad, and then they were left for 9 days to develop obvious solid breast tumor. The combination therapy possessed the best anti-proliferative effect, and a CI < 1 in the MCF7 cell line indicates a synergistic type of drug interaction.

Role of Nrf2 Signaling Cascade in Breast Cancer: Strategies and Treatment,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9098811,Pharmacology,"Breast cancer is the second leading cancer among all types of cancers. It accounts for 12% of the total cases of cancers. The complex and heterogeneous nature of breast cancer makes it difficult to treat in advanced stages. The expression of various enzymes and proteins is regulated by several molecular pathways. Oxidative stress plays a vital role in cellular events that are generally regulated by nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). The exact mechanism of Nrf2 behind cytoprotective and antioxidative properties is still under investigation. In healthy cells, Nrf2 expression is lower, which maintains antioxidative stress; however, cancerous cells overexpress Nrf2, which is associated with various phenomena, such as the development of drug resistance, angiogenesis, development of cancer stem cells, and metastasis. Aberrant Nrf2 expression diminishes the toxicity and potency of therapeutic anticancer drugs and provides cytoprotection to cancerous cells. In this article, we have discussed the attributes associated with Nrf2 in the development of drug resistance, angiogenesis, cancer stem cell generation, and metastasis in the specific context of breast cancer.

Zinc finger protein 32 promotes breast cancer stem cell-like properties through directly promoting GPER transcription,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6255875,Article,"Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death in women. Due to the existence of a small fraction of stem cell-like subpopulations, some breast cancer subtypes exhibit very high malignancy and resistance to multiple therapies. The underlying mechanisms of how these subtypes acquire stem cell-like properties and progress more aggressively remain largely unknown. Zinc finger protein 32 (ZNF32), a newly discovered transcription factor, has been reported to be associated with breast cancer progression. However, many questions remain about its target genes and its exact mechanisms in regulating stem cell-like properties and drug resistance. In the present study, we examined the relationship between ZNF32 and GPER, a membrane-associated estrogen receptor, and we addressed their roles in stemness regulation in human breast cancer cell lines. Our results showed that ZNF32 could induce expansion of stem cell-like subpopulations and increase drug resistance by upregulating GPER expression, in which ERK activation was also implicated. We also illustrated that ZNF32 induced GPER expression via a ZNF32 binding sequence located within the GPER promoter region. A correlation between ZNF32/GPER expression and increased tumor incidence and burden was observed in xenograft mouse models.

Early-stage breast cancer and less aggressive subtypes have promising prognosis for patients, but in aggressive subtypes, and as cancers progress, treatment options and responses diminish, dramatically decreasing survival. Plants are nutritionally rich and biologically diverse organisms containing thousands of metabolites, some of which have chemopreventive, therapeutic, and sensitizing properties, providing a rich source for drug discovery. In this study we review the current landscape of breast cancer with a central focus on the potential role of phytochemicals for treatment, management, and disease prevention. We discuss the relevance of phytochemical targeting of mitochondria for improved anti-breast cancer efficacy. We highlight current applications of phytochemicals and derivative structures that display anti-cancer properties and modulate cancer mitochondria, while describing future applicability and identifying areas of promise.",

"Molecular profiling of a lethal tumor microenvironment, as defined by stromal caveolin-1 status in breast cancers",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3142463,Report,"Breast cancer progression and metastasis are driven by complex and reciprocal interactions, between epithelial cancer cells and their surrounding stromal microenvironment. We have previously shown that a loss of stromal Cav-1 expression is associated with an increased risk of early tumor recurrence, metastasis and decreased overall survival. To identify and characterize the signaling pathways that are activated in Cav-1 negative tumor stroma, we performed gene expression profiling using laser microdissected breast cancer-associated stroma. Tumor stroma was laser capture microdissected from 4 cases showing high stromal Cav-1 expression and 7 cases with loss of stromal Cav-1. Briefly, we identified 238 gene transcripts that were upregulated and 232 gene transcripts that were downregulated in the stroma of tumors showing a loss of Cav-1 expression (p ≤ 0.01 and fold-change ≥1.5). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed “stemness,” inflammation, DNA damage, aging, oxidative stress, hypoxia, autophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction in the tumor stroma of patients lacking stromal Cav-1. Our findings are consistent with the recently proposed “Reverse Warburg Effect” and the “Autophagic Tumor Stroma Model of Cancer Metabolism.” In these two complementary models, cancer cells induce oxidative stress in adjacent stromal cells, which then forces these stromal fibroblasts to undergo autophagy/mitophagy and aerobic glycolysis. This, in turn, produces recycled nutrients (lactate, ketones and glutamine) to feed anabolic cancer cells, which are undergoing oxidative mitochondrial metabolism. Our results are also consistent with previous biomarker studies showing that the increased expression of known autophagy markers (such as ATG16L and the cathepsins) in the tumor stroma is specifically associated with metastatic tumor progression and/or poor clinical outcome.",
Metastatic and triple-negative breast cancer: challenges and treatment options,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6133085,Review Article,"The major current conventional types of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) treatments include surgery, radiation, hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, or immunotherapy. Introducing biological drugs, targeted treatment and gene therapy can potentially reduce the mortality and improve the quality of life in patients with MBC. However, combination of several types of treatment is usually recommended. Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for 10–20% of all cases of breast carcinoma and is characterized by the low expression of progesterone receptor (PR), estrogen receptor (ER), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Consequently, convenient treatments used for MBC that target these receptors are not effective for TNBC which therefore requires special treatment approaches. This review discusses the occurrence of MBC, the prognosis and predictive biomarkers of MBC, and focuses on the novel advanced tactics for treatment of MBC and TNBC. Nanotechnology-based combinatorial approach for the suppression of EGFR by siRNA and gifitinib is described.",
HBXIP is a novel regulator of the unfolded protein response that sustains tamoxifen resistance in ER+ breast cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8908272,Research Article,"Endocrine-therapy-resistant estrogen receptor–positive (ER+) breast cancer cells often exhibit an augmented capacity to maintain endoplasmic reticulum (EnR) homeostasis under adverse conditions. Oncoprotein hepatitis B X-interacting protein (HBXIP) is a known transcriptional coactivator that promotes cancer development. However, it is unclear whether HBXIP participates in maintaining EnR homeostasis and promoting drug resistance in ER+ breast cancer. Here, we report that tamoxifen-resistant (TmaR) breast cancer cells exhibit increased expression of HBXIP, which acts as an inactivator of the unfolded protein response (UPR) to diminish tamoxifen-induced EnR stress. We show that HBXIP deficiency promotes EnR-associated degradation, enhances UPR-element reporter activity and cellular oxidative stress, and ultimately attenuates the growth of TmaR cells",

Many factors such as alcohol, weight fluctuations, or hormonal replacement therapy can potentially contribute to breast cancer development and progression. Another important factor in breast cancer onset includes micronutrient status. In this narrative review, we analyzed 23 micronutrients and their possible influence on breast cancer onset and progression. Further, the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of micronutrient status on the prevention of breast cancer and its possible influence on various therapeutic pathways. We researched meta-analyses, systemic and narrative reviews, retrospective studies, as well as original studies on human and animal models. The results of these studies indicate a possible correlation between the different levels of micronutrients and a decreased risk of breast cancer as well as a better survival rate.

There is sufficient evidence from in vitro, animal and epidemiological human studies that certain vitamins, such as vitamin D3, folate, vitamin B6, and beta carotene as well as dietary micronutrients, such as curcumin, piperine, sulforaphane, indole-3-carbinol, quercetin, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), display an antitumoral activity against breast cancer and have the potential to offer a natural strategy for breast cancer chemoprevention and reduce the risk of breast cancer recurrence. Therefore, a supplement that contains these micronutrients, using the safest form and dosage should be investigated in future breast cancer chemoprevention studies and as part of standard breast cancer therapy.",

Alteration in any of the several physiological mechanisms such as cell cycle checkpoints, DNA repair machinery, mitotic checkpoints, and telomere maintenance results in genomic instability. Theranostic has the potential to foretell and estimate therapy response, contributing a valuable opportunity to modify the ongoing treatments and has developed new treatment strategies in a personalized manner. “Omics” technologies play a key role while studying genomic instability in breast cancer, and broadly include various aspects of proteomics, genomics, metabolomics, and tumor grading. Certain computational techniques have been designed to facilitate the early diagnosis of cancer and predict disease-specific therapies, which can produce many effective results. Several diverse tools are used to investigate genomic instability and underlying mechanisms. The current review aimed to explore the genomic landscape, tumor heterogeneity, and possible mechanisms of genomic instability involved in initiating breast cancer. We also discuss the implications of computational biology regarding mutational and pathway analyses, identification of prognostic markers, and the development of strategies for precision medicine. We also review different technologies required for the investigation of genomic instability in breast cancer cells, including recent therapeutic and preventive advances in breast cancer.",
Natural Small Molecules in Breast Cancer Treatment: Understandings from a Therapeutic Viewpoint,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9000328,Review,"Breast cancer (BrCa) is the most common malignancy in women and the second most significant cause of death from cancer. BrCa is one of the most challenging malignancies to treat, and it accounts for a large percentage of cancer-related deaths. The number of cases requiring more effective BrCa therapy has increased dramatically. Scientists are looking for more productive agents, such as organic combinations, for BrCa prevention and treatment because most chemotherapeutic agents are linked to cancer metastasis, the resistance of the drugs, and side effects. Natural compounds produced by living organisms promote apoptosis and inhibit metastasis, slowing the spread of cancer. As a result, these compounds may delay the spread of BrCa, enhancing survival rates and reducing the number of deaths caused by BrCa. Several natural compounds inhibit BrCa production while lowering cancer cell proliferation and triggering cell death. Natural compounds, in addition to therapeutic approaches, are efficient and potential agents for treating BrCa. This review highlights the natural compounds demonstrated in various studies to have anticancer properties in BrCa cells. Future research into biological anti-BrCa agents may pave the way for a new era in BrCa treatment, with natural anti-BrCa drugs playing a key role in improving BrCa patient survival rates.",
A positive feedback loop between ZEB2 and ACSL4 regulates lipid metabolism to promote breast cancer metastasis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10712958,Research Article,"Lipid metabolism plays a critical role in cancer metastasis. However, the mechanisms through which metastatic genes regulate lipid metabolism remain unclear. Here, we describe a new oncogenic–metabolic feedback loop between the epithelial–mesenchymal transition transcription factor ZEB2 and the key lipid enzyme ACSL4 (long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 4), resulting in enhanced cellular lipid storage and fatty acid oxidation (FAO) to drive breast cancer metastasis. Functionally, depletion of ZEB2 or ACSL4 significantly reduced lipid droplets (LDs) abundance and cell migration. ACSL4 overexpression rescued the invasive capabilities of the ZEB2 knockdown cells, suggesting that ACSL4 is crucial for ZEB2-mediated metastasis. Mechanistically, ZEB2-activated ACSL4 expression by directly binding to the ACSL4 promoter. ACSL4 binds to and stabilizes ZEB2 by reducing ZEB2 ubiquitination. Notably, ACSL4 not only promotes the intracellular lipogenesis and LDs accumulation but also enhances FAO and adenosine triphosphate production by upregulating the FAO rate-limiting enzyme CPT1A (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 isoform A). Finally, we demonstrated that ACSL4 knockdown significantly reduced metastatic lung nodes in vivo. In conclusion, we reveal a novel positive regulatory loop between ZEB2 and ACSL4, which promotes LDs storage to meet the energy needs of breast cancer metastasis, and identify the ZEB2–ACSL4 signaling axis as an attractive therapeutic target for overcoming breast cancer metastasis.",
Inducing ferroptosis has the potential to overcome therapy resistance in breast cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9730886,Immunology,"Breast cancer is the most common type of malignancy among women. Due to the iron-dependent character of breast cancer cells, they are more sensitive to ferroptosis compared to normal cells. It is possible to reverse tumor resistance by inducing ferroptosis in breast cancer cells, thereby improving tumor treatment outcomes. Ferroptosis is highly dependent on the balance of oxidative and antioxidant status. When ferroptosis occurs, intracellular iron levels are significantly increased, leading to increased membrane lipid peroxidation and ultimately triggering ferroptosis. Ferroptotic death is a form of autophagy-associated cell death. Synergistic use of nanoparticle-loaded ferroptosis-inducer with radiotherapy and chemotherapy achieves more significant tumor suppression and inhibits the growth of breast cancer by targeting cancer tissues, enhancing the sensitivity of cells to drugs, reducing the drug resistance of cancer cells and the toxicity of drugs. In this review, we present the current status of breast cancer and the mechanisms of ferroptosis. It is hopeful for us to realize effective treatment of breast cancer through targeted ferroptosis.",
Oxidative stress regulation and related metabolic pathways in epithelial–mesenchymal transition of breast cancer stem cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10685711,Review,"Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a cell remodeling process in which epithelial cells undergo a reversible phenotype switch via the loss of adhesion capacity and acquisition of mesenchymal characteristics. In other words, EMT activation can increase invasiveness and metastatic properties, and prevent the sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapeutics, as mesenchymal cells have a higher resistance to chemotherapy and immunotherapy. EMT is orchestrated by a complex and multifactorial network, often linked to episodic, transient, or partial events. A variety of factors have been implicated in EMT development. Based on this concept, multiple metabolic pathways and master transcription factors, such as Snail, Twist, and ZEB, can drive the EMT. Emerging evidence suggests that oxidative stress plays a significant role in EMT induction. One emerging theory is that reducing mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species production may contribute to EMT development. This review describes how metabolic pathways and transcription factors are linked to EMT induction and addresses the involvement of signaling pathways.",

Vitamin D and Breast Cancer: Mechanistic Update,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8674767,Special Issue,"The presence of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in mammary gland and breast cancer has long been recognized, and multiple preclinical studies have demonstrated that its ligand, 1,25‐dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D), modulates normal mammary gland development and inhibits growth of breast tumors in animal models. Vitamin D deficiency is common in breast cancer patients, and some evidence suggests that low vitamin D status enhances the risk for disease development or progression. Although many 1,25D‐responsive targets in normal mammary cells and in breast cancers have been identified, validation of specific targets that regulate cell cycle, apoptosis, autophagy, and differentiation, particularly in vivo, has been challenging. Model systems of carcinogenesis have provided evidence that both VDR expression and 1,25D actions change with transformation, but clinical data regarding vitamin D responsiveness of established tumors is limited and inconclusive. Because breast cancer is heterogeneous, the relevant VDR targets and potential sensitivity to vitamin D repletion or supplementation will likely differ between patient populations. Detailed analysis of VDR actions in specific molecular subtypes of the disease will be necessary to clarify the conflicting data. Genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses of in vitro and in vivo model systems are also warranted to comprehensively understand the network of vitamin D–regulated pathways in the context of breast cancer heterogeneity.

Mechanisms behind context-dependent role of glucocorticoids in breast cancer progression,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9758252,Non-Thematic Review,"Glucocorticoids (GCs), mostly dexamethasone (dex), are routinely administered as adjuvant therapy to manage side effects in breast cancer. However, recently, it has been revealed that dex triggers different effects and correlates with opposite outcomes depending on the breast cancer molecular subtype. This has raised new concerns regarding the generalized use of GC and suggested that the context-dependent effects of GCs can be taken into potential consideration during treatment design. Based on this, attention has recently been drawn to the role of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in development and progression of breast cancer. Therefore, in this comprehensive review, we aimed to summarize the different mechanisms behind different context-dependent GC actions in breast cancer by applying a multilevel examination, starting from the association of variants of the GR-encoding gene to expression at the mRNA and protein level of the receptor, and its interactions with other factors influencing GC action in breast cancer. The role of GCs in chemosensitivity and chemoresistance observed during breast cancer therapy is discussed. In addition, experiences using GC targeting therapeutic options (already used and investigated in preclinical and clinical trials), such as classic GC dexamethasone, selective glucocorticoid receptor agonists and modulators, the GC antagonist mifepristone, and GR coregulators, are also summarized. Evidence presented can aid a better understanding of the biology of context-dependent GC action that can lead to further advances in the personalized therapy of breast cancer by the evaluation of GR along with the conventional estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) in the routine diagnostic procedure.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9758252/bin/10555_2022_10047_MOESM1_ESM.xlsx

Decoding contextual crosstalk: revealing distinct interactions between non-coding RNAs and unfolded protein response in breast cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10926595,Review,"Breast cancer is significantly influenced by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, impacting both its initiation and progression. When cells experience an accumulation of misfolded or unfolded proteins, they activate the unfolded protein response (UPR) to restore cellular balance. In breast cancer, the UPR is frequently triggered due to challenging conditions within tumors. The UPR has a dual impact on breast cancer. On one hand, it can contribute to tumor growth by enhancing cell survival and resistance to programmed cell death in unfavorable environments. On the other hand, prolonged and severe ER stress can trigger cell death mechanisms, limiting tumor progression. Furthermore, ER stress has been linked to the regulation of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in breast cancer cells. These ncRNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), play essential roles in cancer development by influencing gene expression and cellular processes. An improved understanding of how ER stress and ncRNAs interact in breast cancer can potentially lead to new treatment approaches. Modifying specific ncRNAs involved in the ER stress response might interfere with cancer cell survival and induce cell death. Additionally, focusing on UPR-associated proteins that interact with ncRNAs could offer novel therapeutic possibilities. Therefore, this review provides a concise overview of the interconnection between ER stress and ncRNAs in breast cancer, elucidating the nuanced effects of the UPR on cell fate and emphasizing the regulatory roles of ncRNAs in breast cancer progression.",

Role of Hedgehog Signaling in Breast Cancer: Pathogenesis and Therapeutics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6523618,Review,"Breast cancer (BC) is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in women, only followed by lung cancer. Given the importance of BC in public health, it is essential to identify biomarkers to predict prognosis, predetermine drug resistance and provide treatment guidelines that include personalized targeted therapies. The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway plays an essential role in embryonic development, tissue regeneration, and stem cell renewal. Several lines of evidence endorse the important role of canonical and non-canonical Hh signaling in BC. In this comprehensive review we discuss the role of Hh signaling in breast development and homeostasis and its contribution to tumorigenesis and progression of different subtypes of BC. We also examine the efficacy of agents targeting different components of the Hh pathway both in preclinical models and in clinical trials. The contribution of the Hh pathway in BC tumorigenesis and progression, its prognostic role, and its value as a therapeutic target vary according to the molecular, clinical, and histopathological characteristics of the BC patients. The evidence presented here highlights the relevance of the Hh signaling in BC, and suggest that this pathway is key for BC progression and metastasis.",

The Clinicopathological Significance of BiP/GRP-78 in Breast Cancer: A Meta-Analysis of Public Datasets and Immunohistochemical Detection,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9777260,Article,"The endoplasmic reticulum chaperone BiP (also known as GRP-78 or HSPA5) maintains protein folding to allow cell proliferation and survival and has been implicated in carcinogenesis, tumor progression, and therapy resistance. BiP’s association with clinical factors and prognostic potential in breast cancer remains unclear. In this work, three types of analysis were conducted to improve the knowledge of BiP’s clinicopathological potential: (1) analysis of publicly available RNA-seq and proteomics datasets stratified as high and low quartiles; (2) a systematic review and meta-analysis of immunohistochemical detection of BIP; (3) confirmation of findings by BiP immunohistochemical detection in two luminal-like breast cancer small cohorts of paired samples (pre- vs. post-endocrine therapy, and primary pre- vs. metastasis post-endocrine therapy). The TCGA PanCancer dataset and CPTAC showed groups with high BiP mRNA and protein associated with HER2, basal-like subtypes, and higher immune scores. The meta-analysis of BiP immunohistochemistry disclosed an association between higher BiP positivity and reduced relapse-free survival. BiP immunohistochemistry confirmed increased BiP expression in metastasis, an association of BiP positivity with HER2 expression, and nuclear BiP localization with higher a tumor stage and poor outcome. Therefore, three independent approaches showed that BiP protein is associated with worse outcomes and holds prognostic potential for breast cancer.",
Molecular Links between Central Obesity and Breast Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6862548,Review,"Worldwide, breast cancer (BC) is the most common malignancy in women, in regard to incidence and mortality. In recent years, the negative role of obesity during BC development and progression has been made abundantly clear in several studies. However, the distribution of body fat may be more important to analyze than the overall body weight. In our review of literature, we reported some key findings regarding the role of obesity in BC development, but focused more on central adiposity. Firstly, the adipose microenvironment in obese people bears many similarities with the tumor microenvironment, in respect to associated cellular composition, chronic low-grade inflammation, and high ratio of reactive oxygen species to antioxidants. Secondly, the adipose tissue functions as an endocrine organ, which in obese people produces a high level of tumor-promoting hormones, such as leptin and estrogen, and a low level of the tumor suppressor hormone, adiponectin. As follows, in BC this leads to the activation of oncogenic signaling pathways: NFκB, JAK, STAT3, AKT. Moreover, overall obesity, but especially central obesity, promotes a systemic and local low grade chronic inflammation that further stimulates the increase of tumor-promoting oxidative stress. Lastly, there is a constant exchange of information between BC cells and adipocytes, mediated especially by extracellular vesicles, and which changes the transcription profile of both cell types to an oncogenic one with the help of regulatory non-coding RNAs.",

Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Comparison With Canine Mammary Tumors From Light Microscopy to Molecular Pathology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7689249,Oncology,"Many similar characteristics in human and dog cancers including, spontaneous development, clinical presentation, tumor heterogeneity, disease progression, and response to standard therapies have promoted the approval of this comparative model as an alternative to mice. Breast cancer represents the second most frequent neoplasm in humans after lung cancer. Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) constitute around 15% of all cases of breast cancer and do not express estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and do not overexpress human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). As a result, they do not benefit from hormonal or trastuzumab-based therapy. Patients with TNBC have worse overall survival than patients with non-TNBC. Lehmann and collaborators described six different molecular subtypes of TNBC which further demonstrated its transcriptional heterogeneity. This six TNBC subtype classification has therapeutic implications. Breast cancer is the second most frequent neoplasm in sexually intact female dogs after skin cancer. Canine mammary tumors are a naturally occurring heterogeneous group of cancers that have several features in common with human breast cancer (HBC). These similarities include etiology, signaling pathway activation, and histological classification. Molecularly CMTs are more like TNBCs, and therefore dogs are powerful spontaneous models of cancer to test new therapeutic approaches, particularly for human TNBCs. More malignant tumors of the breast are more often ER and PR negative in both humans and dogs. Promising breast cancer biomarkers in both humans and canines are cancer-associated stroma (CAS), circulating tumor cells and tumor DNA (ctDNA), exosomes and miRNAs, and metabolites.",
Hyperactivation of oxidative mitochondrial metabolism in epithelial cancer cells in situ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3272287,Report,"We have recently proposed a new mechanism for explaining energy transfer in cancer metabolism. In this scenario, cancer cells behave as metabolic parasites, by extracting nutrients from normal host cells, such as fibroblasts, via the secretion of hydrogen peroxide as the initial trigger. Oxidative stress in the tumor microenvironment then leads to autophagy-driven catabolism, mitochondrial dys-function and aerobic glycolysis. This, in turn, produces high-energy nutrients (such as L-lactate, ketones and glutamine) that drive the anabolic growth of tumor cells, via oxidative mitochondrial metabolism. A logical prediction of this new “parasitic” cancer model is that tumor-associated fibroblasts should show evidence of mitochondrial dys-function (mitophagy and aerobic glycolysis). In contrast, epithelial cancer cells should increase their oxidative mitochondrial capacity. To further test this hypothesis, here we subjected frozen sections from human breast tumors to a staining procedure that only detects functional mitochondria. This method detects the in situ enzymatic activity of cytochrome",

However, a comprehensive analysis regarding the expressions, functions, and regulatory network of cuproptosis-related genes is still lacking. In the present work, cuproptosis-related genes, upstream miRNAs and lncRNAs, and clinical data of breast cancer from TCGA database were analyzed by R language including Cox regression analysis, correlation calculation, ROC curve construction, and survival evaluation, and were further verified by public-available databases. Chemosensitivity and immune infiltration were also evaluated by online tools. SLC31A1 was significantly increased in breast cancer samples than those in normal tissues. SLC31A1 was negatively related to a favorable outcome in breast cancer, and the AUC value increased with the prolongation of follow-up time. LINC01614 and miR-204-5p were potential upstream regulators of SLC31A1. Moreover, SLC31A1 was significantly positively correlated with different immune cells infiltration, immune cell biomarkers, and immune checkpoints in breast cancer. SLC31A1 was a potential cuproptosis-related gene in breast cancer, which was significantly upregulated and was able to predict diagnosis, prognosis, chemosensitivity, and immune infiltration. LINC01640/miR-204-5p/SLC31A1 might be a significant and promising axis during cuproptosis in breast cancer.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10603161/bin/41598_2023_45761_MOESM1_ESM.pdf, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10603161/bin/41598_2023_45761_MOESM2_ESM.docx"

Ethanol exposure induces the cancer-associated fibroblast phenotype and lethal tumor metabolism,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3575458,Report,"Little is known about how alcohol consumption promotes the onset of human breast cancer(s). One hypothesis is that ethanol induces metabolic changes in the tumor microenvironment, which then enhances epithelial tumor growth. To experimentally test this hypothesis, we used a co-culture system consisting of human breast cancer cells (MCF7) and hTERT-immortalized fibroblasts. Here, we show that ethanol treatment (100 mM) promotes ROS production and oxidative stress in cancer-associated fibroblasts, which is sufficient to induce myofibroblastic differentiation. Oxidative stress in stromal fibroblasts also results in the onset of autophagy/mitophagy, driving the induction of ketone body production in the tumor microenvironment. Interestingly, ethanol has just the opposite effect in epithelial cancer cells, where it confers autophagy resistance, elevates mitochondrial biogenesis and induces key enzymes associated with ketone re-utilization (ACAT1/OXCT1). During co-culture, ethanol treatment also converts MCF7 cells from an ER(+) to an ER(-) status, which is thought to be associated with “stemness,” more aggressive behavior and a worse prognosis. Thus, ethanol treatment induces ketone production in cancer-associated fibroblasts and ketone re-utilization in epithelial cancer cells, fueling tumor cell growth via oxidative mitochondrial metabolism (OXPHOS). This “two-compartment” metabolic model is consistent with previous historical observations that ethanol is first converted to acetaldehyde (which induces oxidative stress) and then ultimately to acetyl-CoA (a high-energy mitochondrial fuel), or can be used to synthesize ketone bodies. As such, our results provide a novel mechanism by which alcohol consumption could metabolically convert “low-risk” breast cancer patients to “high-risk” status, explaining tumor recurrence or disease progression. Hence, our findings have clear implications for both breast cancer prevention and therapy. Remarkably, our results also show that antioxidants [such as N-acetyl cysteine (NAC)] can effectively reverse or prevent ethanol-induced oxidative stress in cancer-associated fibroblasts, suggesting a novel strategy for cancer prevention. We also show that caveolin-1 and MCt4 protein expression can be effectively used as new biomarkers to monitor oxidative stress induced by ethanol.",

Learning from and Leveraging Multi-Level Changes in Responses to the COVID 19 Pandemic to Facilitate Breast Cancer Prevention Efforts,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8297333,Review,"The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has had multilevel effects on non-COVID-19 health and health care, including deferral of routine cancer prevention and screening and delays in surgical and other procedures. Health and health care use has also been affected by pandemic-related loss of employer-based health insurance, food and housing disruptions, and heightened stress, sleep disruptions and social isolation. These disruptions are projected to contribute to excess non-COVID-19 deaths over the coming decades. At the same time municipalities, health systems and individuals are making changes in response to the pandemic, including modifications in the environmental to promote health, implementation of telehealth platforms, and shifts towards greater self-care and using remote platforms to maintain social connections. We used a multi-level biopsychosocial model to examine the available literature on the relationship between COVID-19-related changes and breast cancer prevention to identify current gaps in knowledge and identify potential opportunities for future research. We found that COVID-19 has impacted several aspects of social and economic life, through a variety of mechanisms, including unemployment, changes in health care delivery, changes in eating and activity, and changes in mental health. Some of these changes should be reduced, while others should be explored and enhanced.",

Splicing dysregulation as a driver of breast cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6055305,Review,"Breast cancer is known to be a heterogeneous disease driven by a large repertoire of molecular abnormalities, which contribute to its diverse clinical behaviour. Despite the success of targeted therapy approaches for breast cancer patient management, there is still a lack of the molecular understanding of aggressive forms of the disease and clinical management of these patients remains difficult. The advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies has paved the way for a more complete understanding of the molecular make-up of the breast cancer genome. As such, it is becoming apparent that disruption of canonical splicing within breast cancer governs its clinical progression. In this review, we discuss the role of dysregulation of spliceosomal component genes and associated factors in the progression of breast cancer, their role in therapy resistance and the use of quantitative isoform expression as potential prognostic and predictive biomarkers with a particular focus on oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.",
Metabolic reprogramming of cancer-associated fibroblasts by TGF-β drives tumor growth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3442913,Report,"We have previously shown that a loss of stromal Cav-1 is a biomarker of poor prognosis in breast cancers. Mechanistically, a loss of Cav-1 induces the metabolic reprogramming of stromal cells, with increased autophagy/mitophagy, mitochondrial dysfunction and aerobic glycolysis. As a consequence, Cav-1-low CAFs generate nutrients (such as L-lactate) and chemical building blocks that fuel mitochondrial metabolism and the anabolic growth of adjacent breast cancer cells. It is also known that a loss of Cav-1 is associated with hyperactive TGF-β signaling. However, it remains unknown whether hyperactivation of the TGF-β signaling pathway contributes to the metabolic reprogramming of Cav-1-low CAFs. To address these issues, we overexpressed TGF-β ligands and the TGF-β receptor I (TGFβ-RI) in stromal fibroblasts and breast cancer cells. Here, we show that the role of TGF-β in tumorigenesis is compartment-specific, and that TGF-β promotes tumorigenesis by shifting cancer-associated fibroblasts toward catabolic metabolism. Importantly, the tumor-promoting effects of TGF-β are independent of the cell type generating TGF-β. Thus, stromal-derived TGF-β activates signaling in stromal cells in an autocrine fashion, leading to fibroblast activation, as judged by increased expression of myofibroblast markers, and metabolic reprogramming, with a shift toward catabolic metabolism and oxidative stress. We also show that TGF-β-activated fibroblasts promote the mitochondrial activity of adjacent cancer cells, and in a xenograft model, enhancing the growth of breast cancer cells, independently of angiogenesis. Conversely, activation of the TGF-β pathway in cancer cells does not influence tumor growth, but cancer cell-derived-TGF-β ligands affect stromal cells in a paracrine fashion, leading to fibroblast activation and enhanced tumor growth. In conclusion, ligand-dependent or cell-autonomous activation of the TGF-β pathway in stromal cells induces their metabolic reprogramming, with increased oxidative stress, autophagy/mitophagy and glycolysis, and downregulation of Cav-1. These metabolic alterations can spread among neighboring fibroblasts and greatly sustain the growth of breast cancer cells. Our data provide novel insights into the role of the TGF-β pathway in breast tumorigenesis, and establish a clear causative link between the tumor-promoting effects of TGF-β signaling and the metabolic reprogramming of the tumor microenvironment.",

Natural and Synthetic PPARγ Ligands in Tumor Microenvironment: A New Potential Strategy against Breast Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7767156,Review,"Multiple lines of evidence indicate that activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) by natural or synthetic ligands exerts tumor suppressive effects in different types of cancer, including breast carcinoma. Over the past decades a new picture of breast cancer as a complex disease consisting of neoplastic epithelial cells and surrounding stroma named the tumor microenvironment (TME) has emerged. Indeed, TME is now recognized as a pivotal element for breast cancer development and progression. Novel strategies targeting both epithelial and stromal components are under development or undergoing clinical trials. In this context, the aim of the present review is to summarize PPARγ activity in breast TME focusing on the role of this receptor on both epithelial/stromal cells and extracellular matrix components of the breast cancer microenvironment. The information provided from the in vitro and in vivo research indicates PPARγ ligands as potential agents with regards to the battle against breast cancer.",

Breast Cancer Stem Cell Membrane Biomarkers: Therapy Targeting and Clinical Implications,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8946706,Review,"Breast cancer is the most common malignancy affecting women worldwide. Importantly, there have been significant improvements in prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment options, which resulted in a significant decrease in breast cancer mortality rates. Nevertheless, the high rates of incidence combined with therapy resistance result in cancer relapse and metastasis, which still contributes to unacceptably high mortality of breast cancer patients. In this context, a small subpopulation of highly tumourigenic cancer cells within the tumour bulk, commonly designated as breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs), have been suggested as key elements in therapy resistance, which are responsible for breast cancer relapses and distant metastasis. Thus, improvements in BCSC-targeting therapies are crucial to tackling the metastatic progression and might allow therapy resistance to be overcome. However, the design of effective and specific BCSC-targeting therapies has been challenging since there is a lack of specific biomarkers for BCSCs, and the most common clinical approaches are designed for commonly altered BCSCs signalling pathways. Therefore, the search for a new class of BCSC biomarkers, such as the expression of membrane proteins with cancer stem cell potential, is an area of clinical relevance, once membrane proteins are accessible on the cell surface and easily recognized by specific antibodies. Here, we discuss the significance of BCSC membrane biomarkers as potential prognostic and therapeutic targets, reviewing the CSC-targeting therapies under clinical trials for breast cancer.",

An overview summarizing the discovery and evaluation of all blood-based biomarkers in metastatic breast cancer is lacking. This systematic review aims to identify the available evidence of known blood-based biomarkers in metastatic breast cancer, regarding their clinical utility and state-of-the-art position in the validation process. The initial search yielded 1078 original studies, of which 420 were assessed for eligibility. A total of 320 studies were included in the final synthesis. A Development, Evaluation and Application Chart (DEAC) of all biomarkers was developed. Most studies focus on identifying new biomarkers and search for relations between these biomarkers and traditional molecular characteristics. Biomarkers are usually investigated in only one study (68.8%). Only 9.8% of all biomarkers was investigated in more than five studies. Circulating tumor cells, gene expression within tumor cells and the concentration of secreted proteins are the most frequently investigated biomarkers in liquid biopsies.

Amino Acid Transporters and Glutamine Metabolism in Breast Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5877768,Review,"Amino acid transporters are membrane transport proteins, most of which are members of the solute carrier families.

Recent studies have demonstrated that the amino acid metabolic pathway is altered in breast cancer and that amino acid transporters affect tumor growth and progression. In breast cancer, glutamine is one of the key nutrients, and glutamine metabolism is closely related to the amino acid transporters. In this review, we focus on amino acid transporters and their roles in breast cancer. We also highlight the different subsets of upregulated amino acid transporters in breast cancer and discuss their potential applications as treatment targets, cancer imaging tracers, and drug delivery components.

Caveolin-1 inhibits breast cancer stem cells via c-Myc-mediated metabolic reprogramming,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7290025,Article,"Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) are considered to be the root of breast cancer occurrence and progression. However, the characteristics and regulatory mechanisms of BCSCs metabolism have been poorly revealed, which hinders the development of metabolism-targeted treatment strategies for BCSCs elimination. Herein, we demonstrated that the downregulation of Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) usually occurred in BCSCs and was associated with a metabolic switch from mitochondrial respiration to aerobic glycolysis. Meanwhile, Cav-1 could inhibit the self-renewal capacity and aerobic glycolysis activity of BCSCs. Furthermore, Cav-1 loss was associated with accelerated mammary-ductal hyperplasia and mammary-tumor formation in transgenic mice, which was accompanied by enrichment and enhanced aerobic glycolysis activity of BCSCs. Mechanistically, Cav-1 could promote Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of c-Myc in BCSCs through the proteasome pathway. Notably, epithelial Cav-1 expression significantly correlated with a better overall survival and delayed onset age of breast cancer patients. Together, our work uncovers the characteristics and regulatory mechanisms of BCSCs metabolism and highlights Cav-1-targeted treatments as a promising strategy for BCSCs elimination.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7290025/bin/41419_2020_2667_MOESM1_ESM.doc, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7290025/bin/41419_2020_2667_MOESM2_ESM.tif, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7290025/bin/41419_2020_2667_MOESM3_ESM.tif, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7290025/bin/41419_2020_2667_MOESM4_ESM.tif, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7290025/bin/41419_2020_2667_MOESM5_ESM.tif, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7290025/bin/41419_2020_2667_MOESM6_ESM.tif, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7290025/bin/41419_2020_2667_MOESM7_ESM.tif, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7290025/bin/41419_2020_2667_MOESM8_ESM.tif, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7290025/bin/41419_2020_2667_MOESM9_ESM.tif, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7290025/bin/41419_2020_2667_MOESM10_ESM.doc, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7290025/bin/41419_2020_2667_MOESM11_ESM.doc"
PI3K/AKT/mTOR Signaling Pathway in Breast Cancer: From Molecular Landscape to Clinical Aspects,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7796017,Review,"Breast cancer is a serious health problem worldwide, representing the second cause of death through malignancies among women in developed countries. Population, endogenous and exogenous hormones, and physiological, genetic and breast-related factors are involved in breast cancer pathogenesis. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a signaling pathway involved in cell proliferation, survival, invasion, migration, apoptosis, glucose metabolism and DNA repair. In breast tumors, PIK3CA somatic mutations have been reported, located in exon 9 and exon 20. Up to 40% of PIK3CA mutations are estrogen receptor (ER) positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -negative in primary and metastatic breast cancer. HER2 is overexpressed in 20–30% of breast cancers. HER1, HER2, HER3 and HER4 are membrane receptor tyrosine kinases involved in HER signaling to which various ligands can be attached, leading to PI3K/AKT activation. Currently, clinical studies evaluate inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis. The main purpose of this review is to present general aspects of breast cancer, the components of the AKT signaling pathway, the factors that activate this protein kinase B, PI3K/AKT-breast cancer mutations, PI3K/AKT/mTOR-inhibitors, and the relationship between everolimus, temsirolimus and endocrine therapy.",

Through Extracellular Vesicles in Tumor Development",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9558853,Emerging Roles of Extracellular Vesicles in Cancer Research and Therapy,"Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. In
solid tumors, the microenvironment plays a critical role in tumor development,
and it has been described a communication between the different cell types that
conform the stroma, including fibroblasts, pericytes, adipocytes, immune cells
and cancer-associated fibroblasts. Intercellular communication is bidirectional,
complex, multifactorial and is mediated by the secretion of molecules and
extracellular vesicles. The extracellular vesicles are vesicles limited by two
membranes that are secreted by normal and cancer cells into the extracellular
space. Extracellular vesicle cargo is complex and includes proteins, miRNAs, DNA
and lipids, and their composition is specific to their parent cells.
Extracellular vesicles are taken up for neighboring or distant cells.
Particularly, extracellular vesicles from breast cancer cells are taken up for
fibroblasts and it induces the activation of fibroblasts into cancer-associated
fibroblasts. Interestingly, cancer associated fibroblasts release extracellular
vesicles that are taken up for breast cancer cells and promote migration,
invasion, proliferation, epithelial–mesenchymal transition, changes in
metabolism, chemoresistance, evasion of immune system and remodeling of
extracellular matrix. In addition, the enrichment of specific cargos in
extracellular vesicles of breast cancer patients has been suggested to be used

Compensatory expression of NRF2-dependent antioxidant genes is required to overcome the lethal effects of Kv11.1 activation in breast cancer cells and PDOs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8220394,Research Paper,"Potassium channels are important regulators of cellular homeostasis and targeting these proteins pharmacologically is unveiling important mechanisms in cancer cell biology. Here we demonstrate that pharmacological stimulation of the Kv11.1 potassium channel activity results in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and fragmentation in breast cancer cell lines and patient-derived organoids independent of breast cancer subtype. mRNA expression profiling revealed that Kv11.1 activity significantly altered expression of genes controlling the production of ROS and endoplasmic-reticulum (ER) stress. Characterization of the transcriptional signature of breast cancer cells treated with Kv11.1 potassium channel activators strikingly revealed an adaptive response to the potentially lethal augmentation of ROS by increasing Nrf2-dependent transcription of antioxidant genes. Nrf2 in this context was shown to promote survival in breast cancer, whereas knockdown of Nrf2 lead to Kv11.1-induced cell death. In conclusion, we found that the Kv11.1 channel activity promotes oxidative stress in breast cancer cells and that suppression of the Nrf2-mediated anti-oxidant survival mechanism strongly sensitized breast cancer cells to a lethal effect of pharmacological activation of Kv11.1.",

Increasing data suggests that some answers to these challenges could be found in the area of epigenetics. In this study, we focus on the current research of the epigenetics of breast cancer, especially on the potential of epigenetics for clinical application in diagnostics, risk stratification and therapy. The differential DNA methylation status of specific gene regions has been used in the past to differentiate breast cancer cells from normal tissue. New technologies as detection of circulating nucleic acids including microRNAs to early detect breast cancer are emerging. Pattern of DNA methylation and expression of histone-modifying enzymes have been successfully used for risk stratification. However, all these epigenetic biomarkers should be validated in larger clinical studies. Recent preclinical and clinical studies show a therapeutic benefit of epigenetically active drugs for breast cancer entities that are still difficult to treat (triple negative, UICC stage IV). Remarkably, epigenetic therapies combined with chemotherapies or hormone-based therapies represent the most promising strategy. At the current stage, the integration of epigenetic substances into established breast cancer therapy protocols seems to hold the greatest potential for a clinical application of epigenetic research.",
