Metabolic adaptability in metastatic breast cancer by AKR1B10-dependent balancing of glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6586667,Article,"The different stages of the metastatic cascade present distinct metabolic challenges to tumour cells and an altered tumour metabolism associated with successful metastatic colonisation provides a therapeutic vulnerability in disseminated disease. We identify the aldo-keto reductase AKR1B10 as a metastasis enhancer that has little impact on primary tumour growth or dissemination but promotes effective tumour growth in secondary sites and, in human disease, is associated with an increased risk of distant metastatic relapse.

Unconventional protein post-translational modifications: the helmsmen in breast cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8881842,Review,"Breast cancer is the most prevalent malignant tumor and a leading cause of mortality among females worldwide. The tumorigenesis and progression of breast cancer involve complex pathophysiological processes, which may be mediated by post-translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins, stimulated by various genes and signaling pathways. Studies into PTMs have long been dominated by the investigation of protein phosphorylation and histone epigenetic modifications. However, with great advances in proteomic techniques, several other PTMs, such as acetylation, glycosylation, sumoylation, methylation, ubiquitination, citrullination, and palmitoylation have been confirmed in breast cancer. Nevertheless, the mechanisms, effects, and inhibitors of these unconventional PTMs (particularly, the non-histone modifications other than phosphorylation) received comparatively little attention. Therefore, in this review, we illustrate the functions of these PTMs and highlight their impact on the oncogenesis and progression of breast cancer. Identification of novel potential therapeutic drugs targeting PTMs and development of biological markers for the detection of breast cancer would be significantly valuable for the efficient selection of therapeutic regimens and prediction of disease prognosis in patients with breast cancer.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8881842/bin/13578_2022_756_MOESM1_ESM.docx
STAT1 potentiates oxidative stress revealing a targetable vulnerability that increases phenformin efficacy in breast cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8175605,Article,"Bioenergetic perturbations driving neoplastic growth increase the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), requiring a compensatory increase in ROS scavengers to limit oxidative stress. Intervention strategies that simultaneously induce energetic and oxidative stress therefore have therapeutic potential. Phenformin is a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor that induces bioenergetic stress. We now demonstrate that inflammatory mediators, including IFNγ and polyIC, potentiate the cytotoxicity of phenformin by inducing a parallel increase in oxidative stress through STAT1-dependent mechanisms. Indeed, STAT1 signaling downregulates NQO1, a key ROS scavenger, in many breast cancer models. Moreover, genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of NQO1 using β-lapachone (an NQO1 bioactivatable drug) increases oxidative stress to selectively sensitize breast cancer models, including patient derived xenografts of HER2+ and triple negative disease, to the tumoricidal effects of phenformin. We provide evidence that therapies targeting ROS scavengers increase the anti-neoplastic efficacy of mitochondrial complex I inhibitors in breast cancer.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8175605/bin/41467_2021_23396_MOESM1_ESM.pdf, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8175605/bin/41467_2021_23396_MOESM2_ESM.pdf, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8175605/bin/41467_2021_23396_MOESM3_ESM.pdf, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8175605/bin/41467_2021_23396_MOESM4_ESM.xlsx, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8175605/bin/41467_2021_23396_MOESM5_ESM.xlsx, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8175605/bin/41467_2021_23396_MOESM6_ESM.xlsx, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8175605/bin/41467_2021_23396_MOESM7_ESM.pdf"
The sirtuin family in health and disease,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9797940,Review Article,"Sirtuins (SIRTs) are nicotine adenine dinucleotide(+)-dependent histone deacetylases regulating critical signaling pathways in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and are involved in numerous biological processes. Currently, seven mammalian homologs of yeast Sir2 named SIRT1 to SIRT7 have been identified. Increasing evidence has suggested the vital roles of seven members of the SIRT family in health and disease conditions. Notably, this protein family plays a variety of important roles in cellular biology such as inflammation, metabolism, oxidative stress, and apoptosis, etc., thus, it is considered a potential therapeutic target for different kinds of pathologies including cancer, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and other conditions. Moreover, identification of SIRT modulators and exploring the functions of these different modulators have prompted increased efforts to discover new small molecules, which can modify SIRT activity. Furthermore, several randomized controlled trials have indicated that different interventions might affect the expression of SIRT protein in human samples, and supplementation of SIRT modulators might have diverse impact on physiological function in different participants. In this review, we introduce the history and structure of the SIRT protein family, discuss the molecular mechanisms and biological functions of seven members of the SIRT protein family, elaborate on the regulatory roles of SIRTs in human disease, summarize SIRT inhibitors and activators, and review related clinical studies.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9797940/bin/41392_2022_1257_MOESM1_ESM.docx

PEAK1 (Pseudopodium-Enriched Atypical Kinase One) is an actin cytoskeleton- and focal adhesion-associated pseudokinase that promotes cell state plasticity and cancer metastasis by mediating growth factor-integrin signaling crosstalk. Here, we determined that stromal PEAK1 expression predicts poor outcomes in HER2-positive breast cancers high in SNAI2 expression and enriched for MSC content. Specifically, we identified that the fibroblastic stroma in HER2-positive breast cancer patient tissue stains positive for both nuclear SNAI2 and cytoplasmic PEAK1. Furthermore, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) express high PEAK1 protein levels and potentiate tumorigenesis, lapatinib resistance and metastasis of HER2-positive breast cancer cells in a PEAK1-dependent manner.

"Adverse outcome pathways for ionizing radiation and breast cancer involve direct and indirect DNA damage, oxidative stress, inflammation, genomic instability, and interaction with hormonal regulation of the breast",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7261741,Review Article,"Knowledge about established breast carcinogens can support improved and modernized toxicological testing methods by identifying key mechanistic events. Ionizing radiation (IR) increases the risk of breast cancer, especially for women and for exposure at younger ages, and evidence overall supports a linear dose–response relationship. We used the Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) framework to outline and evaluate the evidence linking ionizing radiation with breast cancer from molecular initiating events to the adverse outcome through intermediate key events, creating a qualitative AOP. We identified key events based on review articles, searched PubMed for recent literature on key events and IR, and identified additional papers using references. We manually curated publications and evaluated data quality. Ionizing radiation directly and indirectly causes DNA damage and increases production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS). RONS lead to DNA damage and epigenetic changes leading to mutations and genomic instability (GI). Proliferation amplifies the effects of DNA damage and mutations leading to the AO of breast cancer. Separately, RONS and DNA damage also increase inflammation. Inflammation contributes to direct and indirect effects (effects in cells not directly reached by IR) via positive feedback to RONS and DNA damage, and separately increases proliferation and breast cancer through pro-carcinogenic effects on cells and tissue. For example, gene expression changes alter inflammatory mediators, resulting in improved survival and growth of cancer cells and a more hospitable tissue environment. All of these events overlap at multiple points with events characteristic of “background” induction of breast carcinogenesis, including hormone-responsive proliferation, oxidative activity, and DNA damage. These overlaps make the breast particularly susceptible to ionizing radiation and reinforce that these biological activities are important characteristics of carcinogens. Agents that increase these biological processes should be considered potential breast carcinogens, and predictive methods are needed to identify chemicals that increase these processes. Techniques are available to measure RONS, DNA damage and mutation, cell proliferation, and some inflammatory proteins or processes. Improved assays are needed to measure GI and chronic inflammation, as well as the interaction with hormonally driven development and proliferation. Several methods measure diverse epigenetic changes, but it is not clear which changes are relevant to breast cancer. In addition, most toxicological assays are not conducted in mammary tissue, and so it is a priority to evaluate if results from other tissues are generalizable to breast, or to conduct assays in breast tissue. Developing and applying these assays to identify exposures of concern will facilitate efforts to reduce subsequent breast cancer risk.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7261741/bin/204_2020_2752_MOESM1_ESM.xlsx, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7261741/bin/204_2020_2752_MOESM2_ESM.xlsx, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7261741/bin/204_2020_2752_MOESM3_ESM.xlsx"

Notch signaling pathway: a comprehensive prognostic and gene expression profile analysis in breast cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9730604,Research,"Breast cancer is a complex disease exhibiting a great degree of heterogeneity due to different molecular subtypes. Notch signaling regulates the differentiation of breast epithelial cells during normal development and plays a crucial role in breast cancer progression through the abnormal expression of the Notch up-and down-stream effectors. To date, there are only a few patient-centered clinical studies using datasets characterizing the role of Notch signaling pathway regulators in breast cancer; thus, we investigate the role and functionality of these factors in different subtypes using publicly available databases containing records from large studies. High-throughput genomic data and clinical information extracted from TCGA were analyzed. We performed Kaplan–Meier survival and differential gene expression analyses using the HALLMARK_NOTCH_SIGNALING gene set. To determine if epigenetic regulation of the Notch regulators contributes to their expression, we analyzed methylation levels of these factors using the TCGA HumanMethylation450 Array data. Notch receptors and ligands expression is generally associated with the tumor subtype, grade, and stage. Furthermore, we showed gene expression levels of most Notch factors were associated with DNA methylation rate. Modulating the expression levels of Notch receptors and effectors can be a potential therapeutic approach for breast cancer.

RACK1 facilitates breast cancer progression by competitively inhibiting the binding of β-catenin to PSMD2 and enhancing the stability of β-catenin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10582012,Article,"The receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1) is a key scaffolding protein with multifunctional and multifaceted properties. By mediating protein-protein interactions, RACK1 integrates multiple intracellular signals involved in the regulation of various physiological and pathological processes. Dysregulation of RACK1 has been implicated in the initiation and progression of many tumors. However, the exact function of RACK1 in cancer cellular processes, especially in proliferation, remains controversial. Here, we show that RACK1 is required for breast cancer cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. This effect of RACK1 is associated with its ability to enhance β-catenin stability and activate the canonical WNT signaling pathway in breast cancer cells. We identified PSMD2, a key component of the proteasome, as a novel binding partner for RACK1 and β-catenin. Interestingly, although there is no interaction between RACK1 and β-catenin, RACK1 binds PSMD2 competitively with β-catenin. Moreover, RACK1 prevents ubiquitinated β-catenin from binding to PSMD2, thereby protecting β-catenin from proteasomal degradation. Collectively, our findings uncover a novel mechanism by which RACK1 increases β-catenin stability and promotes breast cancer proliferation.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10582012/bin/41419_2023_6191_MOESM1_ESM.pdf, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10582012/bin/41419_2023_6191_MOESM2_ESM.pdf, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10582012/bin/41419_2023_6191_MOESM3_ESM.tif, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10582012/bin/41419_2023_6191_MOESM4_ESM.tif, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10582012/bin/41419_2023_6191_MOESM5_ESM.tif, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10582012/bin/41419_2023_6191_MOESM6_ESM.tif, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10582012/bin/41419_2023_6191_MOESM7_ESM.docx, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10582012/bin/41419_2023_6191_MOESM8_ESM.xlsx, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10582012/bin/41419_2023_6191_MOESM9_ESM.xlsx, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10582012/bin/41419_2023_6191_MOESM10_ESM.xlsx"

NMT1 inhibition modulates breast cancer progression through stress-triggered JNK pathway,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6240078,Article,"Myristoylation is one of key post-translational modifications that involved in signal transduction, cellular transformation and tumorigenesis. Increasing evidence demonstrates that targeting myristoylation might provide a new strategy for eliminating cancers. However, the underlying mechanisms are still yielded unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that genetic inhibition of N-myristoyltransferase NMT1 suppressed initiation, proliferation and invasion of breast cancer cells either in vitro or in vivo. We identified ROS could negatively regulate NMT1 expression and NMT1 knockdown conversely promoted oxidative stress, which formed a feedback loop. Furthermore, inhibition of NMT1 caused degraded proteins increase and ER stress, which cross-talked with mitochondria to produce more ROS. And both of oxidative stress and ER stress could activate JNK pathway, leading to autophagy which abrogated breast cancer progression especially triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). These studies provide a preclinical proof of concept for targeting NMT1 as a strategy to treat breast cancer.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6240078/bin/41419_2018_1201_MOESM1_ESM.xlsx, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6240078/bin/41419_2018_1201_MOESM2_ESM.xlsx, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6240078/bin/41419_2018_1201_MOESM3_ESM.docx, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6240078/bin/41419_2018_1201_MOESM4_ESM.tif, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6240078/bin/41419_2018_1201_MOESM5_ESM.tif, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6240078/bin/41419_2018_1201_MOESM6_ESM.tif, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6240078/bin/41419_2018_1201_MOESM7_ESM.tif, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6240078/bin/41419_2018_1201_MOESM8_ESM.tif"

In the present study, we uncovered that HM13 was highly expressed in breast cancer and correlated with worse prognosis. Downregulation of HM13 could suppress breast cancer cell proliferation and metastasis abilities. Tumorigenicity mediated by HM13 was also observed in the xenograft model. Knockdown of HM13 could activate autophagy by inducing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Moreover, further experiments demonstrated that downregulated HM13 could inhibit PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. We then verified that HM13 was a direct target of miR-760 functioned as a tumor -suppressor in breast cancer. And the tumor suppressive effects of miR-760 could be partially reversed by HM13. Taken together, these findings elucidated that HM13, targeted by miR-760, could play an oncogenic role in breast cancer by inducing autophagic inhibition and facilitating PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. Our findings suggested HM13 could act as a novel therapeutic target candidate for breast cancer and supported the idea that autophagy inducers might represent a new approach to treat breast cancer.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9509374/bin/41419_2022_5154_MOESM1_ESM.pdf, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9509374/bin/41419_2022_5154_MOESM2_ESM.pdf, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9509374/bin/41419_2022_5154_MOESM3_ESM.docx, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9509374/bin/41419_2022_5154_MOESM4_ESM.tif, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9509374/bin/41419_2022_5154_MOESM5_ESM.tif, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9509374/bin/41419_2022_5154_MOESM6_ESM.tif, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9509374/bin/41419_2022_5154_MOESM7_ESM.tif, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9509374/bin/41419_2022_5154_MOESM8_ESM.tif, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9509374/bin/41419_2022_5154_MOESM9_ESM.tif, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9509374/bin/41419_2022_5154_MOESM10_ESM.pdf, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9509374/bin/41419_2022_5154_MOESM11_ESM.xlsx"

The role of CPT1A as a biomarker of breast cancer progression: a bioinformatic approach,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9525709,Article,"Breast cancer is the commonest malignancy of women and with its incidence on the rise, the need to identify new targets for treatment is imperative. There is a growing interest in the role of lipid metabolism in cancer. Carnitine palmitoyl-transferase-1 (CPT-1); the rate limiting step in fatty acid oxidation, has been shown to be overexpressed in a range of tumours. There are three isoforms of CPT-1; A, B and C. It is CPT-1A that has been shown to be the predominant isoform which is overexpressed in breast cancer. We performed a bioinformatic analysis using readily available online platforms to establish the prognostic and predictive effects related to CPT-1A expression. These include the KM plotter, the Human Protein Atlas, the cBioPortal, the G2O, the MethSurvand the ROC plotter. A Network analysis was performed using the Oncomine platform and signalling pathways constituting the cancer hallmarks, including immune regulation as utilised by NanoString. The epigenetic pathways were obtained from the EpiFactor website. Spearman correlations (r) to determine the relationship between CPT-1A and the immune response were obtained using the TISIDB portal. Overexpression of CPT-1A largely confers a worse prognosis and CPT-1A progressively recruits a range of pathways as breast cancer progresses. CPT-1A’s interactions with cancer pathways is far wider than previously realised and includes associations with epigenetic regulation and immune evasion pathways, as well as wild-type moderate to high penetrant genes involved in hereditary breast cancer. Although CPT-1A genomic alterations are detected in 9% of breast carcinomas, both the alteration and the metagene associated with it, confers a poor prognosis. CPT-1A expression can be utilised as a biomarker of disease progression and as a potential therapeutic target.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9525709/bin/41598_2022_20585_MOESM1_ESM.pptx, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9525709/bin/41598_2022_20585_MOESM2_ESM.xlsx, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9525709/bin/41598_2022_20585_MOESM3_ESM.xlsx, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9525709/bin/41598_2022_20585_MOESM4_ESM.xlsx, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9525709/bin/41598_2022_20585_MOESM5_ESM.xlsx, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9525709/bin/41598_2022_20585_MOESM6_ESM.xlsx, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9525709/bin/41598_2022_20585_MOESM7_ESM.xlsx"

"Environmental chemicals, breast cancer progression and drug resistance",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7672852,Review,"Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common causes of cancer in the world and the second leading cause of cancer deaths among women. Mortality is associated mainly with the development of metastases. Identification of the mechanisms involved in metastasis formation is, therefore, a major public health issue. Among the proposed risk factors, chemical environment and pollution are increasingly suggested to have an effect on the signaling pathways involved in metastatic tumor cells emergence and progression. The purpose of this article is to summarize current knowledge about the role of environmental chemicals in breast cancer progression, metastasis formation and resistance to chemotherapy. Through a scoping review, we highlight the effects of a wide variety of environmental toxicants, including persistent organic pollutants and endocrine disruptors, on invasion mechanisms and metastatic processes in BC. We identified the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and cancer-stemness (the stem cell-like phenotype in tumors), two mechanisms suspected of playing key roles in the development of metastases and linked to chemoresistance, as potential targets of contaminants. We discuss then the recently described pro-migratory and pro-invasive Ah receptor signaling pathway and conclude that his role in BC progression is still controversial. In conclusion, although several pertinent pathways for the effects of xenobiotics have been identified, the mechanisms of actions for multiple other molecules remain to be established. The integral role of xenobiotics in the exposome in BC needs to be further explored through additional relevant epidemiological studies that can be extended to molecular mechanisms.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7672852/bin/12940_2020_670_MOESM1_ESM.docx

Betulinic acid chemosensitizes breast cancer by triggering ER stress-mediated apoptosis by directly targeting GRP78,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5970196,Article,"Stress-induced cellular defense machinery has a critical role in mediating cancer drug resistance, and targeting stress-related signaling has become a novel strategy to improve chemosensitivity. Betulinic acid (BA) is a naturally occurring pentacyclic triterpenoid with potent anticancer bioactivities in multiple malignancies, whereas its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here in, we found that BA has synergistic effects with taxol to induce breast cancer cells G2/M checkpoint arrest and apoptosis induction, but had little cytotoxicity effects on normal mammary epithelial cells. Drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) strategy further identified glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) as the direct interacting target of BA. BA administration significantly elevated GRP78-mediated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and resulted in the activation of protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK)/eukaryotic initiation factor 2a/CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein apoptotic pathway. GRP78 silencing or ER stress inhibitor salubrinal administration was revealed to abolish the anticancer effects of BA, indicating the critical role of GRP78 in mediating the bioactivity of BA. Molecular docking and coimmunoprecipitation assay further demonstrated that BA might competitively bind with ATPase domain of GRP78 to interrupt its interaction with ER stress sensor PERK, thereby initiating the downstream apoptosis cascade. In vivo breast cancer xenografts finally validated the chemosensitizing effects of BA and its biofunction in activating GRP78 to trigger ER stress-mediated apoptosis. Taken together, our study not only uncovers GRP78 as a novel target underlying the chemosensitizing effects of BA, but also highlights GRP78-based targeting strategy as a promising approach to improve breast cancer prognosis.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5970196/bin/41419_2018_669_MOESM1_ESM.tif, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5970196/bin/41419_2018_669_MOESM2_ESM.tif, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5970196/bin/41419_2018_669_MOESM3_ESM.tif, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5970196/bin/41419_2018_669_MOESM4_ESM.docx"

We recently reported that the basal level of NO in the normal breast epithelia plays crucial roles in tissue homeostasis, whereas its reduction contributes to the malignant phenotype of cancer cells.

Anti-neoplastic action of Cimetidine/Vitamin C on histamine and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in Ehrlich breast cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9262990,Article,"The main focus of our study is to assess the anti-cancer activity of cimetidine and vitamin C via combating the tumor supportive role of mast cell mediators (histamine, VEGF, and TNF-α) within the tumor microenvironment and their effect on the protein kinase A(PKA)/insulin receptor substrate-1(IRS-1)/phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/serine/threonine kinase-1 (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) cue in Ehrlich induced breast cancer in mice. In vitro study was carried out to evaluate the anti-proliferative activity and combination index (CI) of the combined drugs. Moreover, the Ehrlich model was induced in mice via subcutaneous injection of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma cells (EAC) in the mammary fat pad, and then they were left for 9 days to develop obvious solid breast tumor. The combination therapy possessed the best anti-proliferative effect, and a CI < 1 in the MCF7 cell line indicates a synergistic type of drug interaction. Regarding the in vivo study, the combination abated the elevation in the tumor volume, and serum tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level. The serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) level and immunohistochemical staining for CD34 as markers of angiogenesis were mitigated. Additionally, it reverted the state of oxidative stress and inflammation. Meanwhile, it caused an increment in apoptosis, which prevents tumor survival. Furthermore, it tackled the elevated histamine and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, preventing the activation of the (PKA/IRS-1/PI3K/AKT/mTOR) cue.

Zinc finger protein 32 promotes breast cancer stem cell-like properties through directly promoting GPER transcription,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6255875,Article,"Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death in women. Due to the existence of a small fraction of stem cell-like subpopulations, some breast cancer subtypes exhibit very high malignancy and resistance to multiple therapies. The underlying mechanisms of how these subtypes acquire stem cell-like properties and progress more aggressively remain largely unknown. Zinc finger protein 32 (ZNF32), a newly discovered transcription factor, has been reported to be associated with breast cancer progression. However, many questions remain about its target genes and its exact mechanisms in regulating stem cell-like properties and drug resistance. In the present study, we examined the relationship between ZNF32 and GPER, a membrane-associated estrogen receptor, and we addressed their roles in stemness regulation in human breast cancer cell lines. Our results showed that ZNF32 could induce expansion of stem cell-like subpopulations and increase drug resistance by upregulating GPER expression, in which ERK activation was also implicated. We also illustrated that ZNF32 induced GPER expression via a ZNF32 binding sequence located within the GPER promoter region. A correlation between ZNF32/GPER expression and increased tumor incidence and burden was observed in xenograft mouse models. We conclude that ZNF32 can engage GPER/ERK signalling and confer breast cancer stem cell-like properties, which may indicate poor prognosis of breast cancer patients. ZNF32 and GPER targeted therapies might provide new solutions for breast cancer treatment.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6255875/bin/41419_2018_1144_MOESM1_ESM.jpg, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6255875/bin/41419_2018_1144_MOESM2_ESM.jpg, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6255875/bin/41419_2018_1144_MOESM3_ESM.jpg, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6255875/bin/41419_2018_1144_MOESM4_ESM.jpg, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6255875/bin/41419_2018_1144_MOESM5_ESM.doc, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6255875/bin/41419_2018_1144_MOESM6_ESM.doc"

Mechanisms behind context-dependent role of glucocorticoids in breast cancer progression,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9758252,Non-Thematic Review,"Glucocorticoids (GCs), mostly dexamethasone (dex), are routinely administered as adjuvant therapy to manage side effects in breast cancer. However, recently, it has been revealed that dex triggers different effects and correlates with opposite outcomes depending on the breast cancer molecular subtype. This has raised new concerns regarding the generalized use of GC and suggested that the context-dependent effects of GCs can be taken into potential consideration during treatment design. Based on this, attention has recently been drawn to the role of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in development and progression of breast cancer. Therefore, in this comprehensive review, we aimed to summarize the different mechanisms behind different context-dependent GC actions in breast cancer by applying a multilevel examination, starting from the association of variants of the GR-encoding gene to expression at the mRNA and protein level of the receptor, and its interactions with other factors influencing GC action in breast cancer. The role of GCs in chemosensitivity and chemoresistance observed during breast cancer therapy is discussed. In addition, experiences using GC targeting therapeutic options (already used and investigated in preclinical and clinical trials), such as classic GC dexamethasone, selective glucocorticoid receptor agonists and modulators, the GC antagonist mifepristone, and GR coregulators, are also summarized. Evidence presented can aid a better understanding of the biology of context-dependent GC action that can lead to further advances in the personalized therapy of breast cancer by the evaluation of GR along with the conventional estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) in the routine diagnostic procedure.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9758252/bin/10555_2022_10047_MOESM1_ESM.xlsx

Identification of cuproptosis-related gene SLC31A1 and upstream LncRNA-miRNA regulatory axis in breast cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10603161,Article,"Mounting evidence indicate that cuproptosis, a novel form of programmed cell death, contributes to cancer development and progression. However, a comprehensive analysis regarding the expressions, functions, and regulatory network of cuproptosis-related genes is still lacking. In the present work, cuproptosis-related genes, upstream miRNAs and lncRNAs, and clinical data of breast cancer from TCGA database were analyzed by R language including Cox regression analysis, correlation calculation, ROC curve construction, and survival evaluation, and were further verified by public-available databases. Chemosensitivity and immune infiltration were also evaluated by online tools. SLC31A1 was significantly increased in breast cancer samples than those in normal tissues. SLC31A1 was negatively related to a favorable outcome in breast cancer, and the AUC value increased with the prolongation of follow-up time. LINC01614 and miR-204-5p were potential upstream regulators of SLC31A1. Moreover, SLC31A1 was significantly positively correlated with different immune cells infiltration, immune cell biomarkers, and immune checkpoints in breast cancer. SLC31A1 was a potential cuproptosis-related gene in breast cancer, which was significantly upregulated and was able to predict diagnosis, prognosis, chemosensitivity, and immune infiltration. LINC01640/miR-204-5p/SLC31A1 might be a significant and promising axis during cuproptosis in breast cancer.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10603161/bin/41598_2023_45761_MOESM1_ESM.pdf, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10603161/bin/41598_2023_45761_MOESM2_ESM.docx"
Effects of isoflavones on breast tissue and the thyroid hormone system in humans: a comprehensive safety evaluation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6132702,Review Article,"Isoflavones are secondary plant constituents of certain foods and feeds such as soy, linseeds, and red clover. Furthermore, isoflavone-containing preparations are marketed as food supplements and so-called dietary food for special medical purposes to alleviate health complaints of peri- and postmenopausal women. Based on the bioactivity of isoflavones, especially their hormonal properties, there is an ongoing discussion regarding their potential adverse effects on human health. This review evaluates and summarises the evidence from interventional and observational studies addressing potential unintended effects of isoflavones on the female breast in healthy women as well as in breast cancer patients and on the thyroid hormone system. In addition, evidence from animal and in vitro studies considered relevant in this context was taken into account along with their strengths and limitations. Key factors influencing the biological effects of isoflavones, e.g., bioavailability, plasma and tissue concentrations, metabolism, temporality (pre- vs. postmenopausal women), and duration of isoflavone exposure, were also addressed. Final conclusions on the safety of isoflavones are guided by the aim of precautionary consumer protection.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6132702/bin/204_2018_2279_MOESM1_ESM.docx

Caveolin-1 inhibits breast cancer stem cells via c-Myc-mediated metabolic reprogramming,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7290025,Article,"Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) are considered to be the root of breast cancer occurrence and progression. However, the characteristics and regulatory mechanisms of BCSCs metabolism have been poorly revealed, which hinders the development of metabolism-targeted treatment strategies for BCSCs elimination. Herein, we demonstrated that the downregulation of Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) usually occurred in BCSCs and was associated with a metabolic switch from mitochondrial respiration to aerobic glycolysis. Meanwhile, Cav-1 could inhibit the self-renewal capacity and aerobic glycolysis activity of BCSCs. Furthermore, Cav-1 loss was associated with accelerated mammary-ductal hyperplasia and mammary-tumor formation in transgenic mice, which was accompanied by enrichment and enhanced aerobic glycolysis activity of BCSCs. Mechanistically, Cav-1 could promote Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of c-Myc in BCSCs through the proteasome pathway. Notably, epithelial Cav-1 expression significantly correlated with a better overall survival and delayed onset age of breast cancer patients. Together, our work uncovers the characteristics and regulatory mechanisms of BCSCs metabolism and highlights Cav-1-targeted treatments as a promising strategy for BCSCs elimination.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7290025/bin/41419_2020_2667_MOESM1_ESM.doc, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7290025/bin/41419_2020_2667_MOESM2_ESM.tif, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7290025/bin/41419_2020_2667_MOESM3_ESM.tif, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7290025/bin/41419_2020_2667_MOESM4_ESM.tif, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7290025/bin/41419_2020_2667_MOESM5_ESM.tif, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7290025/bin/41419_2020_2667_MOESM6_ESM.tif, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7290025/bin/41419_2020_2667_MOESM7_ESM.tif, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7290025/bin/41419_2020_2667_MOESM8_ESM.tif, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7290025/bin/41419_2020_2667_MOESM9_ESM.tif, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7290025/bin/41419_2020_2667_MOESM10_ESM.doc, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7290025/bin/41419_2020_2667_MOESM11_ESM.doc"
